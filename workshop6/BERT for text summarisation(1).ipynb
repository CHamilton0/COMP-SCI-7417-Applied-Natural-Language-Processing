    "The Summarizer() function imported from the summarizer in Python is an extractive text summarization tool. It uses the BERT model to analyze and extract key sentences from a larger text. This function aims to retain the most important information, providing a condensed version of the original content. It's commonly used to summarize lengthy documents efficiently."
