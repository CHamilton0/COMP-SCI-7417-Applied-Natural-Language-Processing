      "Actual review: My husband and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. We normally stay at very high class hotels but that night we wanted to try something new without spending a fortune. (St. Regis, Ritz, etc are our norms) We wanted the Tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel (unassuming front) The Bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away. While checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say Happy Anniversary. Being Starwood platinum, we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade. We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before. Now that I know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us, I will go back soon. We go into the city a lot and I will for sure go back!! Thank you so much Sheraton! You wowed us!!\n",

Lobby is particularly beautiful. Breakfast was excellent as was comfort of very large king-bed room. No pool and no balconies, but everything else is excellent. Yes, there is a large number of homeless people walking around the neighborhood, but they didnt bother me. Large shopping center and excellent restaurants in Gaslight quarter outside your door. It's about 10 blocks downhill or a $8.00 cabride to the port.\n",

      "Actual review: For the past year and a half, my daughter has been fighting cancer. We have had to travel to both Dallas and Houston for treatment, and the Crowne Plaza has always been there to offer a clean, inexpensive, convienent, and hospitable place for us to stay. Our last stay was at the River Oaks Crowne Plaza in Houston, Texas, and as always, the hotel was there when we needed them. Everything from the help at the front desk to help finding a place to eat was taken care of. Mandy, the concierge, was extremely knowledgable concerning local restaurants, shuttles, and even a taxi with comfortable seats and a non smoking atmosphere to take my wife and daughter to the airport only 3 days out of major surgery. We will always seek out a Crowne Plaza to stay at when available, and will always recommend them to friends and family when needing a place to stay. The Crowne Plaza is one of the unsung heros in our fight to rid our daughter of cancer.\n",

      "Actual review: Great Value for a King, Queen, and Princesses. We stayed at the Pacific Terrace with our two daughters (3.5 and 8 months old) for five nights in early March. The hotel was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It looked even better in person than on the hotel website. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our \"partial-oceanview.\" The room was roomy. I wish the beds weren't so high off the ground since I have two young children, but the rooms were beautiful. There was a big flat screen T.V. The sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready. There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing. I found the convenience of the parking well worth the $15. This was such a great value. We would definitely go back in a heart beat.\n",

      "Actual review: A tremendous hotel, the like of which we would never see in Europe (certainly not at this price). Space, comfort, well equipped rooms, a choice of pools, an impressive spa and a well-equipped gym with a consistently high quality standard of service throughout. Details have been looked after and lessons learned from the sometimes antiseptic feel of the high-end chains. The food is excellent with the Addison worth a visit in itself. The golf course is fantastically maintained and tuition is hands-on and effective. An instant favourite\n",

      "Actual review: This hotel is very beautiful to walk into. There is real Tiffany glass above the check-in, and fantastic chandelliers throughout the main floor. The room I stayed in was somewhat small, the bathroom a remodel from the 60s or 70s, but very clean and adequate. Bed was very comfortable, and that really counts. And the window opened. I like real air.\n",

      "Actual review: As a preface, I travel to a limited degree to review rock concerts, and have begun to include hotel and resort reviews as well, which I am republishing here is modified form. This review is for The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites in Los Angeles, during my recent Los Angeles Trip (February 2012).\n",
      "Room Type/Class: Traditional Room\n",
      "Date: February 7-10, 2012\n",
      "Overall Rating: 4/5\n",
      "This trip was explicitly to attend two concert events - one at Club Nokia and the other one in Hollywood. I lived and worked in Los Angeles for many years while I was in graduate school, so I'm really familiar with it. Since Club Nokia is part of L.A. Live, I thought it made sense to find a hotel that is within walking distance of L.A. Live, which put me downtown. I considered the Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton that are part of L.A. Live, but they were much more expensive compared with The Westin Bonaventure's Hotwire price.\n",
      "I ended up deciphering a \"hidden\" discounted offering on one website to purchase on another, and found that The Westin Bonaventure was the hotel being offered within that class range for a highly discounted cost off the base rate, and booked it.\n",
      "So the hotel has valet parking, but it is an additional $35 per night. If you don't mind walking a block or two, I noticed that there appeared to be some other public parking alternatives that would be cheaper; I ended up using the valet, which is underground and you walk down a hallway adorned with movie poster one sheets of films shot at and around the hotel (see photos below), and up an escalator toward the main entry level where the front desk is located.\n",
      "Check-in was quick and otherwise unremarkable. I had originally booked two nights, but one of my events was canceled and rescheduled... I asked if I could add a night at the discounted price, and was told they couldn't sell rooms at that price, but the guy at the front desk looked in his computer to see their occupancy for the desired night, and more or less indicated that if I went on that reseller website again, I would likely be able to add the third night at the same reduced rate (when I went up to my room, I was able to do this and add it on).\n",
      "I was actually really excited to check out the elevators, as there is a scene with Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies where he goes up one of the elevators on horseback; the gentleman at the front desk was able to direct me to the exact elevator I was seeking.\n",
      "As for the room itself, I had the basic/base room, and was pleased that it was on one of the higher floors (better views). While on the small side, it was very clean and nicely appointed, as I've learned to expect from Westin properties.\n",
      "Maybe because it is an older property, the shower and bed are maybe not as \"Heavenly\" as some other Westin properties, but overall the room suited my needs perfectly (traveling alone) with king-sized bed and computer desk. Internet connectivity via WiFi was good but not spectacular.\n",
      "For me, the best bonus of the room was the view. Most of the outward facing wall is glass floor to ceiling, as the view was spectacular, particularly at night.\n",
      "There are some amenities in the hotel that I just didn't have the time to use - restaurant, bar, etc.\n",
      "As noted, I had come to L.A. for a concert at L.A. Live, and found that it was definitely a reasonable walking distance from the Westin Bonaventure - maybe too far for some people's taste, but I walked back and forth several times and I don't think it took more 15 minutes.\n",
      "Overall, I don't have any complaints at all, though it would be nice if valet parking was included, but I knew from my research ahead of time that was a cost to factor into the overall value proposition of the stay. When I attend a future event at L.A. Live, I would likely return to the Bonaventure, unless there is a special deal at one of the competing properties.\n",

      "Actual review: Absolutely over-the-top experience from beginning to end. Not the least expensive spot in town, but I defy you to find a hotel of this caliber that offers suites of this size at lower prices. You won't. Since the hotel is freshly renovated, every inch of the property is spotless & fresh. We had a London Suite on the 17th floor which was silent when the windows were closed. Our suite had a parlor which was separated from the bedroom by a small entryway & a very well-lit bathroom, which was enormous. The huge mirrors on the bathroom wall were separated by fabulous light panels that made makeup application a breeze. In addition, the shower area was ~9' x 4' with a \"rain shower\" type fixture on one end, and a \"shower massage\" fixture on the other. There was also a Euro hand-held fixture, so the bases were covered regarding your showering options. The bed offered super deluxe pillow-top comfort, and the pillows were fab. The linens were very high thread-count sateen. The ambiance is minimalist/elegant in the suites & throughout the hotel. Didn't try the restaurant/bar. Loved every moment that we were there & look forward to returning. Hopefully their discounted rate will continue forever.\n",

      "Actual review: Stayed in early June for a conference. Huge hotel, with helpful staff and decent size rooms. Beds were also very comfortable. I had a nice view of Michigan Ave (Magnificent Mile). The bathroom though was surprisingly tiny. Overall, it needs some renovation to compete with the likes of Trump tower! The breakfast on the first day was a bit of a disaster. It was just so chaotic, the food itself was pretty decent tho. Decent size pool and gym for those who are keen to keep fit. I would look to the newer places to stay next time tho.\n",

      "Actual review: We stayed here in August with 4 adults & 4 kids, 4,6,8,& 10. Great location because it is an easy walk to inner harbor. The down side was they had no pool & bar closed early. We wanted to bring a glass of wine up to room when kids went to sleep but it closed 8-9. We did get 2 rooms that had an outer door that closed from the hallway so we had great privacy. Rooms were very clean and breakfast was nice. The front desk was helpful when asked about restaurants & directions. We left our car parked the whole time & walked to Inner Harbor, Aquarium, Children's Museum, and even to Little Italy. Would stay here again.\n",

This is a full-service hotel with a top-notch restaurant, bar/lounge, nice outdoor pool for a city hotel, gift shop, jewelry store, and large fitness center. Staff was professional and very courteous. The location is great - close to the zoo, subway, and Georgetown. I would definitely consider staying here again, although it's $$$$.

The room was clean (16th floor) though it was a little shabby. The furniture in the room were new and the bed was ok. Bathroom was very clean and had fresh towels almost every day. The services in the hotel and in the lobby were also great though we sometimes needed to wait for some time to get to our safe deposit box. But hey, they have 1700 rooms! Altogether the hotel is really a bargain. Just don't expect Plaza for that price!\n",

      "Actual review: We just got back from a week long stay at this hotel, which happened to be our honeymoon. We had to change our original Florida plans due to the hurricanes. Neither of us had any major complaints. The staff was excellent as was our room. We were on the 8th floor overlooking the Charles River. The suites have ample space and the beds are perfect! Once you climbed into the down comforters and pillows it was difficult to get out. The concierge would do anything for us and was well prepared to dish out any information concerning the local area. Among the things we didnt like were the 20$ per day parking fee. I thought this was a little steep for a paying guest at the hotel. The only other complaint I have is the entrance/exit to the hotel. If you drive to the hotel you will curse entering or exiting the property. We rented a car for the week but after being there one day we found it completely unnecessary. The hotel offers free shuttles to areas of interest and cab fare to other places is reasonable. Plus you dont have to deal with the insanely packed streets of Boston.\n",

      "Actual review: First the positives: the staff are great! Friendly and knowledgeable. They seem to really enjoy their job and want to help guests. The hotel is also fairly clean and the rooms are quite large. They have a business centre, swimming pool and gym which are small but adequate. The breakfast is continental...nothing spectacular but adequate for your needs.\n",
      "I guess the hotel seems a bit dated but fine for any 3 to 3 1/2 star hotel. The neighbourhood and some guests are a bit eclectic. It is not unsafe but I would describe some guests as edgy/artsy. The hotel has a funky vibe....again, not bad but just different.\n",
      "All in all, it is a great hotel if your expectation is correct. It is not a Four Seasons but very adequate. There is noise from the highway but not really disturbing. Some of the appliances/taps can be noisy/dripping but again, easy to fix. I think the staff really turn this from an OK hotel to a quite a decent place to stay.\n",

I'm hoping to return again in October with my 5 year old son as it is also a very safe facility.\n",

      "Actual review: To say we were ‘disappointed’ with this hotel would be the understatement of the century. First of all we arrived to find there was no elevator despite having 3 floors in the building, and as we had a lot of luggage this was not much appreciated. The second we walked into the room it was clear we were staying in quite a well kept establishment as they had saved us the hassle of turning doorknobs by ripping them off each door. The beds came equipped with filthy sheets, each sporting brown stains, what these came from we are not sure but one can speculate…\n",
      "The state of the beds was second only to how uncomfortable they were, particularly the fold out bed we were given. This particular bed collapsed as soon as it was unfolded, and upon telling the Manager about it we were given the response: “Yeah, that one’s broken.” Is it? Is it really? My God thank you for enlightening me.\n",

Rest assured they were quite helpful, they looked at the Cockroach with a very ‘I’ve obviously seen numerous cockroaches in this hotel before’ look and said “Oh that’s scary.” Needless to say, we will not be going back, and we feel sorry for anyone else that has to endure this hell hole. There are phenomenally better hotels for around the same price even closer to downtown; we strongly suggest you choose one of those.\n",

      "Actual review: Stayed March 14 - 17, 2008. The Tuscin Inn is a great hotel depending your room location. Location is the best. Everything is in walking distance, shopping, etc. The weather is great, just a little cold and windy but no rain; there were sunny days on our trip. Walgreens was a great store and purchase clothing less than the vendor on the street were offering. \n",
      "I had a government rate which was very good for the room selection. We had a double beds for the first 2 nights and a suite for the next two nights. The room are exact has they appear on the wedsite. Made our reservations on Best Western.com. The room 454 had double beds and no view. The closet are very small but the room was comfortable. When checking in remember to asked for the bar key so you can store beverages in the refrigerator. Room 402, was the suite, large bathrooom, no closet space, nice room, fireplace, but the sofa bed was terrible. In addition, the heater did not work, so I had to order additional blankets to get warm...even received a slight cold upon return. Room 402 did have a view, they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night. Did not asked for a discount; they told me to contact Manager who was unable at the time each time I inquired. The Corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not (may be the government rate). The coffee in the morning was great; did not attend the wine party. Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great. If you book a room, asked for the courtyard view if possibe. Location is everything at this site; everything you need is right in the area. Pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance. Do you go the aquarium; not worth the price.\n",
      "Grayline tours were great. Took the $10 per person on the ride around the bay (best price). The battleship was a great tour also. Did not do Alcaraz tour due to the kids. Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service. There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service. We traveled with 2 adults and 2 children.\n",

      "Actual review: I stayed here for an overnight weekend with my out of town friends. I originally booked at the Plaza Bevery Hills but my friends couldn't get reservations there as they are already fully book. So I cancelled my reservation there and booked here. I was surprised how the Plaza Hotel and this little Marriott hotel have pretty much the same price. I would probably prefer to stay at the Plaza but I'm still glad I booked here as I personally did not have issues on this hotel. In fact, I actually had a pleasant stay. My room was perfect for me. It was roomy, smells and feels clean. My sheets and my king size bed were comfortable. Most importantly, my room was very quiet. My first time to sleep 7 hours straight since my son was born. So yea, this deserve a 4 stars in my book. By all means, this hotel is more of a 3 stars hotel but pleasant stay and good night sleep is priceless. \n",

      "Actual review: The hotel itself is lovely, fantastic breakfast with everything you can imagine. The managers reception was the best we have had at an Embassy Suites Hote. The room itself was very spacious, clean and I would definately say this is more plush than other Embassy Suites. Unfortunately, you do have to pay for internet in the rooms and the free internet lounge was often full.The location is great for the airport but not particularly convenient for Downtown Boston, the underground is about a 5-10 minute walk and for adults, the return fare is not especially cheap. With children, you may want a more convenient hotel if you are exploring the city! What I would say is the hotel overall was very good value! For 5 people, we couldn't find anything of a similar price...\n",

      "Actual review: Had always heard thisnwas a gem in the city but had heard it had gotten tired and was not run well. Well that is not true. This is an elegant, sophisticated property for those who like tasteful decor and don't want the crowds of larger properties. Our room is immaculate, beautifully appointed and very comfortable. This hotel has the best location of all hotel properties if you would like to be able to walk to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.\n",

      "Actual review: We stayed at this Sheraton for a conference my husband was attending. The hotel is located on the river between the lake and the Miracle Mile. The location is a great starting point to shop and sightsee. The hotel itself is clean and the staff was friendly. Our room was average with the bare essentials. It was a decent size, but there were no perks. Basic shampoo, conditioner and soap. No bathrobes or even cotton balls.\n",
      "The staff was very helpful. They provided directions and even a pass to skip the line at a local Chicago style pizza place. (BTW, ordering a pizza from Malnati's or Gino's is cheaper than room service and they deliver. Concierge will give you a list of who delivers.)\n",

      "Actual review: One of the best things about Hotel Max is its location. It is so close to everything that you can park the car and not worry about driving it again until you leave (presuming the stay is relatively brief). Other things I thought were great about Hotel Max was the staff, whom always seemed friendly. The valet guys were quick and efficient with the parking and bringing the car back out once we were checking out. I was also relieved that the front desk had some extra umbrellas for us to borrow as it was pouring rain outside.\n",
      "The decor was definitely unique too, with red and grey serving as the primary theme colors all over the hotel. We did wonder what Hotel Max was in its previous life as given its modern decor, you couldn't help but still feel that this was quite an old building with its walls and carpeting simply painted over and re-carpeted. \n",
      "Why \"teeny-tiny\"? Well, our room was extremely small, with the shower and the toilet in separate \"closets\". I wouldn't have minded it too much on my own but unless you are on your own and is no more than 5'2 and120 pounds, you may feel as if you are over-sized for the room. I'm about 5'2 and I had a hard time maneuvering around the tiny bathroom (it is just slightly larger than an airplane lavatory). Be prepared for little or no counter-space. The shower was interesting in that it was also in a closet. Thankfully, it worked normal. Lastly, the heater/air conditioner in our room was extremely loud. I'm not sure if it is like this in all rooms, but I couldn't sleep until I finally made the decision to turn it off at 2am. I'm guessing that the louder noise was probably exacerbated by the small size of the room and the close proximity of everything in it.\n",
      "I would come back to Hotel Max again on my own or with a girlfriend. I wouldn't recommend it if you are used to having lots of space to move around.\n",

      "Actual review: We returned from our 2 night stay at the Hotel Vital which opened recently. \n",
      "Location: It is located close to the freeway so it easy to find but so close that you hear traffic noise. It is right across the street from the newly remodeled Ferry building, which includes restaurants and shops, and down the street from Pier 39. \n",
      "Service: Upon making reservations we had to switch days and they were not especially friendly over the phone but not rude either. I suppose 'efficient' would be appropriate. The rooms are significantly more expensive during the week than the weekend which is the opposite of most places we visit. Our check-in was very pleasant and we did arrive four hours before check-in! We were greeted and to our surprise promptly given an available room. \n",
      "Hotel: The hotel has a modern, zen-like feel. The hallways are very dimly lit which may not be plus for many people. The artwork and lavendar pieces in the hallway are a nice touch. Our room was average sized with a great bed and nice linens. Flatscreen t.v., c.d. player with four c.d.s, bathroom amenties from the Fresh co. Our view was of a building wall but if you are able to get a view of the water, it would be amazing. My husband hated the bathroom door as it is more visually appealing than suited for privacy. \n",

But getting back to room size, we could barely fit extra rack for suit case let alone another bed....as for Location, well it's a lovely view, perched on top of \"snob hill\", but makes exploring a chore because the road to it is soooooo steep (had to take heels off walking down as it's that steep!) so not a handy, easily accessible location.... I would have perfered bottom of hill near Union Square, cheaper, less impressive lobby... Service was ok but hardly worth the $$$ for the tiny room... Oh did I mention window in room looking at wall?\n",

      "Actual review: Paid $369 a night and no free Wi-Fi !! Why can I sit in a McDonald's and get free Wi-Fi and not at this nice hotel?? There was no coffee pot in the room which I thought was odd. The bed was very comfy but all it had on it was a sheet and a \"Duvet of Death\" which weighed about 20 lbs. Wish they had another choice of blanket. Another odd thing was the maid came everyday at 4:30pm for turn down service. We were always scrambling around at this time getting ready for dinner so we sent her away. Altogether, it was a nice trip to Seattle but I prefer the Sheraton.\n",

      "Actual review: If you are only after an affordable place to stay in a top location go for this hotel. We were out all day during our stay so we knew we only needed a bed to stay in. My husban and 3yr old and I slept comfortably in the bed. we were on a higher floor facing the street and did not hear much noise. \n",
      " It's perfectly located near Union Square, The Bart stop (though an uphill walk) the cable car stop as well. We took the BART easily from the airport and within 30mins arrived at Powell st station and walked some blocks to the hotel. The room we had had two double beds and large clean bathroom flat screen tv. Some people complained on reviews about the breakfast but if you are getting pastries for free there isnt much to complain about. Free wifi in the lobby. \n",
      "Once again if you want a fancier experience go for a nicer hotel as this is the basics (no hairdryer) but apart from that it is good. Some staff members need to smile a little more\n",

      "Actual review: We stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon tour of the west coast in April. This was the best hotel we stayed in - we absolutely loved it! It is very different to the modern hotels we stayed in on other parts of the trip - this one one is grand and old style, with afternoon drinks and an actual key for your room. The staff were lovely and very helpful. The location is stunning - Pacific Heights is the most beautiful area and you are surrounded by traditional houses and views of the bay. SF is very hilly so do expect a few walks up and down steep roads - but it is totally worth it. Follow Pacific Avenue right down and you are in china town which is great fun.\n",
      "The room was lovely and big and had a luxurious bathroom - you really felt you were staying in a big old housein the 1940s.\n",
      "The hotel has a lounge where you can get tea and coffee 24/7 and home made biscotti in the afternoons. The breakfast was included and was a nice buffet with plenty of options.\n",
      "I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city - but especially if you are looking for some quirky charm and tradition. This was just the perfect place for a honeymoon escape.\n",

      "Actual review: After reading the many, many positive reviews, I didn't have any worries about booking a stay here for a weekend getaway w/ a friend. And...as expected...we had a very good experience. The lobby is small but very sleek & modern. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. Our room was clean & comfortable. Even though the hotel is in a GREAT location, just a block & half off Michigan Ave, it was too cold for us wimps to walk around so we cabbed instead. Valet parking is only $9 more and worth it because the self park is on the next street over and down a little, plus it offers in/out privileges.\n",
      "We had reserved a room w/ two doubles and asked to be away from the elevators since my friend & I are both light sleepers. We were told that all the doubles are by the elevators & the kings make up the rest of the rooms on each floor, but were assured that there was soundproofing so we shouldn't hear the elevator noise. We were happy to find this true- we didn't hear a PEEP from the elevators, just the crying baby next door.\n",
      "A breakfast buffet is included which had all the standard cereal, yogurt, bagels, juice etc, plus hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, a waffle maker & batter and breakfast sandwiches & mini-quiches that you could heat in the microwave.\n",
      "It's not a 5 star plush hotel w/ fancy robes and such but you can't beat the cleanliness & value for the money here.\n",
      "The only negative was that we came back after a long Saturday night out & were planning to watch a pay-per-view movie, but the tv's do not have that option. Oh well...minor detail. \n",

      "Actual review: The was the worst, most DISTGUSTINGLY unsanitary hotel I have ever stayed at. When booking the reservation, I knew it wasn't 5 star or anything but was told it was a quality 3 star place and had been recently renovated. However my room definitely had not been renovated (or cleaned for that matter) in a long long time. Don't be fooled by the hotel lobby which is decent the rooms are a nightmare. There were holes and mysterious substances on the walls/carpeting. All of the furniture was broken and stained & looked like it was picked out of a trash dump. The beds only had a thin blanket and sheets and didnt look very clean. The bathroom had what looked like blood stains and was very dirty. The shower flooded the bathroom when it was on. We complained to the staff and were told they could offer us an upgrade for an additional $100, but when I pressed the desk clerk she said that she couldn't guarentee it would be any nicer. It was so bad I was afraid that I was going to catch something from being in the room so my friend and I stayed out all nite just to avoid being in the room. It was the worst hotel experience I've ever had and am shocked the hotel assoc or health dept doesn't shut them down. Dont let the ratings fool you it is a 1-star, maybe 2-star place at best.\n",

      "The room size was adequate and felt clean (other than the bottom of the shower). The first room we were assigned to smelled and the bathroom was not cleaned properly (hair in the sink and bathtub) so the bellman called down to request a new room for us. The employees were nice (except for those working at the bar...they were very stiff and would not acknowledge me until I asked to be waited on (the happened twice). We decided to drive to Chicago and stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, only to find out upon check out that they charge $55/day for parking!!! I feel that is a ridiculous amount…we travel often and have never paid such an outrageous fee for parking! They also still charge for Wi-Fi and tried to charge us the $9.95/day fee 3 times on the same day, so check your bill before checking out and be aware of the parking fee if you plan to drive in.\n",

      "Actual review: We Stayed at the W for 4 nights. Pretty neat hotel. Yes the walls were a little thin but we were there St Patty's night & slept great!\n",
      "Beds were very comfortable, Pool was average. Very Hip, alot of 20 somethings having a good time. We had our 2 Boys with us (12 &9) They thought it was verycool! The Bellman even gave them some waterbottles,games & a yoyo on check out. I parked at Millenium garage on advice from the forum here to save on the $40/ night valet. The going rate is about $300, we paid only $120 because of Hotwire so it in my opinion was terrific value. My advice: If you can get a great rate it is more than worth it! We found Chicago to be very friendly to tourists- It really is a great city! with GREAT People!\n",

I'm sure it's a great place to stay. I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in the same room as a hotel. I'm not sure a tad yelling. I'd rather stay there for a few nights. I've never seen the hotel a bit too busy. I'm not sure how much I would have to wait for the next day.\n",
      "Actual review: Don't waste your money. This hotel is overpriced, don't let the breakfast fool you, not worth it. The hotel is dirty. The staff could care less about you. Just a bad experience. One good thing it was cold so we could shop right there or take the metro to get out of there. You may want to take your own sheets since the sheets in our room were dirty. We complained and it took forever to get new ones. The shower was not cleaned. Again, the staff took no action. The once nice staff was at breakfast who seated us. They are more interested in talking to each other that you. There are plenty of places to stay take some time and do your research.\n",

      "Actual review: Check-in was alright, friendly staff. Park in front of room, and was 3 min from where I had to be in the morning, but all downhill from there. No fridge or micro. Gross beds, desk falling apart with sticky crap on the leg when I went to prop it up with a phonebook. Looked like dang oil spots on the carpet! Internet actually worked great, but the tv was not a flatscreen. One serious problem was sharing a parking lot with a very seedy-looking strip club. Not a place you'd want to stay with kids! Also, nasty fake eyelashes on the mirror. Property unfortunately had the feel of a cheap brothel. At least it was cheap.\n",

      "Actual review: We stayed in the Baldwin Hotel in November 2012 and were generally happy with our stay. The hotel itself is located on the edge of San Francisco's china town and feels safe, comfortable and quiet. It is also close to Union Square and the main shopping district. You will need to jump onto the famous trams if you are wanting to visit other sites however, though these are just around the corner. The rooms are a little dated but were clean and tidy and the staff were always happy to help us with our queries.\n",

      "Actual review: We got a room at this hotel through a discount hotel broker and couldn't have been more pleased. First off - this hotel is generally called \"Club Quarters World Trade Center\" on travel sites, but it appears that unless you are a Club Quarters member, you actually stay at the \"World Center Hotel\" which is all in the same building, but have different sets of front doors. \n",
      "This hotel was hands down a great value in NYC. We got this room for about $150 a night plus tax. The location is a little sleepy on weekends, but is safe and easy to get to (multiple train lines - 1, R, 6, and I believe the A C or E all service this general area,). \n",
      "The room was small, but was well appointed. Sadly, we were on the 16th floor, but the room only provided a window into a neighboring building - but the views from this hotel could be gorgeous depending on which room you get.\n",
      "Service was okay upon check in. We arrived well before check-in began, and it is their policy to take your bags and then have them in your room for you when you do come to check in later. Check in is done through computers in the lobby, which seems to work well (Beware, when you check in the card you use in the machine will be debited $90.00 for incidentals - I had planned to use a different card for that, but the machine does not tell you before it charges the incidentals). When checking out, we left our bags with the front desk to pick up later. When we returned to pick up our bags before departing the city, it took approximately 20 minutes to get them (it appears they store them on an upper floor) - so beware that it may not be lightning fast!\n",
      "The free water bottles in the hallway is really nice touch and very helpful (and saves money buying bottles from street vendors or shops!). The bed was comfortable and we slept well. \n",
      "The biggest downside for me to this hotel is the SHOWER. Our shower (and we had a handicap accessible shower, so perhaps it is different from others in the hotel) consisted of a 1 inch tall gray plastic wall around the floor and a shower curtain. While it looks innovative, etc. it is very easy to get water everywhere on the floor. They really should have built these showers differently. Also, the water pressure was quite low on the 16th floor. \n",
      "Overall, a great stay. You can't beat it for the right price.\n",

The \"continental breakfast\" was better than most offered at hotels and included herbed eggs that tasted fresh and were delicious. The coffee (something important to me) was great as well. The location of the hotel is near the convention center and Chinatown which is known for great restaurants, etc. The hotel is also within walking distance of some notable attractions as well.

      "Actual review: My wife and I spent the weekend at Hotel George on Capitol Hill. It was a terrific experience! The hotel is relatively small with a very warm and intimate feeling inside. It's a great location, within blocks of The Capitol, near the subway, a short walk to The Mall (and a half block from Starbucks :-) The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The French restaurant \"Bistro bis\" is outstanding...rivals the best in Paris or La Côte d'Azur. We'll definitely be back!\n",

      "Actual review: My husband and I are just back from our first trip to San Francisco. I chose the Chancellor based on reviews on Trip Advisor, and we were not disappointed. I e-mailed the manager, Wes Tyler, several times prior to our trip with questions and he always responded promptly, which was a nice touch. I'm not sure one would get this at a larger hotel. EVERYTHING about our stay at the Chancellor more than met our expectations. We had booked shuttle service from the airport with Lorrie's, which I found on the hotel's website and which I'm sure saved us considerable time as we were unfamiliar with getting around San Francisco. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not yet ready, but we had expected this and left our bags to go on an Alcatraz tour. When we returned, we went to our room which, as requested prior to our arrival, was a corner room with a view of Union Square (room 1203). Surprise! Waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine, two Chancellor wine glasses, gift-wrapped photo frame, and nice note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our recent marriage. What a way to welcome your guests! The room was painted in lovely shades of green and taupe, with nice prints on the walls. The bed had a soft white comforter and many pillows. Television, armchairs, dressers, lamps, etc. were more than adequate. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies for the four nights we were there. The bathroom was plenty big for the both of us, and well-appointed with soap, shampoo, lotion, tissues, cotton balls and Q-Tips, hair dryer, and makeup mirror (plus the rubber ducky was a cute touch!). The ceiling fan and open windows provided more than enough ventilation. The large closet was much appreciated, as was the iron, ironing board, and in-room safe. The room was very quiet at all times, and street noise was not bothersome. All of the staff that we encountered were efficient, friendly, and helpful--particularly Steve (helped us with restaurant reservations), Susie (answered transportation questions and arranged shuttle service back to SFO), and Matt (brought our bags to the room). Everyone that we saw truly seemed to enjoy working at the hotel. We visited both the bar and restaurant and had pleasant experiences along with moderately priced, tasty meals/drinks. As many reviewers have previously noted, the location of the Chancellor can't be beat for just about anything a tourist would want to do in San Francisco, particularly shopping and dining. If we ever return to San Francisco (which I sincerely hope to do, because I fell in love with it), there is no way I would stay anywhere other than the Chancellor. THANK YOU!\n",

      "Actual review: I stay at the St. Gregory Hotel for the second time and I must admit that it is great. M. Bah was very helpful during check in. We came in at 1 am in the morning and was upgraded to a suite for $129. We will always return. If you need a good hotel in a nice neighborhood stay at the St. Gregory Hotel the rooms are very specious with kitchen. There is a business center that is free to use.\n",

      "Actual review: This hotel is just around the corner from the main \"Times Square,\" which is great because it puts you in a convenient location without actually being right on the most crowded, noisy street in NYC. The hotel is small, and the lobby/rooms are not anything extravagant. It reminded me more of a European hotel in its size. For us that was totally fine, but if you're only interested in space and want the newest, fanciest hotel with a view, then this is not the one you want. However, if you want a friendly staff, a clean/quiet room, free breakfast, free wine/cheese/fruit/veggies every evening, and 24 access to coffee/ice water/baked goods then this IS the hotel for you :) You also get free WiFi and access to a fitness center should you want it, though we did not use these options. The hotel was nice enough to put a complimentary bottle of wine in our room for our anniversary, which we appreciated. Also, the cafe on the second floor (where all the free stuff is) has a nice little outdoor terrace that we enjoyed sitting on at night.\n",

      "Actual review: We just came back from a week's stay here. It was just what we wanted, an inexpensive, clean, comfortable room in a good area. Close enough (2 blocks) to Fisherman's Wharf to be convenient to everything in the city, but far enough to not be noisy. Friendly, helpful staff. The included hot breakfast every morning was a real plus.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, and would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Actual review: Keep in mind - I've never stayed at a Club Quarters hotel despite my 60+ nights/year in hotels. That having been said, I was made to feel quite foolish by the front desk staff when I didn't know that check-in was via an automated kiosk and not from the front desk attendants. Regardless, I wouldn't let that spoil my visit - the hotel itself is just a few steps off Wall Street, making it a great location Monday - Friday and totally desolate Friday night through Sunday. The hotel restaurant and bar were closed, but there is a Duane Reade across the street with limited hours, and South Street Seaport is a few blocks away.\n",
      "The hallways are very narrow, making it difficult to balance a laptop bag and suitcase while attempting to get to your room. Big perk - chilled, purified water stations on every floor adjacent to a closet with extra pillows, blankets, and ironing boards. The room itself was adequate for a solo traveler: double bed, desk with ergo chair, flat-screen TV, decently sized bathroom with nice toiletries, and good WiFi. Everything in the hotel is spotlessly clean, and the TV/computer lounge on the main floor is a nice perk. Bizarrely enough, the cost for a 3 PM checkout is $35 - I've never seen that before, but I suppose it's just part of a limited-service hotel.\n",
      "Net, if I can't get in to any of my usual hotels in NYC, or if I really need to be on Wall Street, I would probably consider the Club Quarters again.\n",

      "Actual review: Pear Tree is a good place if you are on a budget and need a room for a good value. This is a slightly older property but still well maintained. The staff is very courteous and helpful. Check in was easy and quick. The hotel is located on 410, not far from Northstar mall. There are a few restaurants close by and a short car ride will get you to many more restaurants. As we were there in the winter we didn't get to try the pool. \n",
      "THE ROOMS - They are pretty roomy and our room had the mini-fridge and microwave. The bed was reasonably comfortable, I wish it was a little softer but for a weekend it will suffice. The bathroom is average sized and like most hotels seems to fog up quickly if you take a hot shower. The floor gets slippery so definately law down a towel to keep you from slipping. \n",
      "CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST - This was the best thing about the hotel. They had a good supply of food. The bagels were fresh and the waffle maker a good touch. It gets packed (especially the waffle maker station)because everyone staying there eats the breakfast so expect a crowd. \n",
      "BUILDING - It was nice and tidy. Not extravagant or posh, but well-maintained and not musty smelling like many Ramadas. It could use some new carpet in the hallways and maybe in the rooms too. However, the carpet is an old style but not dirty or dingy. The building is well insulated from sounds and it was surprisingly quiet. \n",

      "Actual review: My husband & I stayed here as we had a 7am departure from San Diego airport. As I was unfamiliar with the proximity of downtown etc we thought it would be a convenient base. Overall I was extremely happy with the newly branded Holiday Inn Express and the value we received for just under $130/nt incl tax. The hotel is 100% located parallel to the freeway so I requested a room facing away from the freeway and Jose was very happy to oblige when we checked in just after 8pm. In fact Jose was friendly, attentive and helpful....which is not the usual response when you check into a property so late in the day. We had rm #347 and you could not hear a peep from the freeway! The one complaint my husband had was that the airconditioner was very noisy. To make matters worse it kept turning itself on/off all night which was noisy and frustrating. We couldnt seem to figure out how to keep it constantly on...if management could somehow fix this I think it would certainly help. I would suggest bringing ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. We had a rental car from Enterprise and it was literally down the road so it was very convenient so early in the morning. The Holiday Inn Express also had a little convenience store in the lobby which was open 24 hours so you could easily grab some water or some snacks to tide you over. The renovation was really well done - new carpet, furniture, microwave, kettle, tv, duvet set etc...even the bathroom had been preened (still keeping in with some of the retro outfit though). All in all I was very happy with the Holiday Inn Express...\n",

      "Actual review: Some people here have rated the wrong hotel! You can not complain about the restaurant or bartender, when it doesn't have a restaurant or a bar. I have come across other reviews for the wrong hotel and I'm definitely going to use TripAdvisor very carefully now. It's not necessarily accurate.\n",
      "Anyway, this is a good place to stay. The room is warm and cosy. The bed very comfortable. The breakfast is nice too! I would stay here again any time. The only drawback for me is that there is no restaurant nearby. If I had a car, no problem. There's plenty of parking, too. The free internet made up for it, that's always a bonus for me.\n",

The bedding had holes in it and the beds were hard. One of the shower taps was loose and you could see the holes the taps came out of the wall. I thought we were in the \"hood\". There's signs on the hotel entrance door about the amount of the cash kept in the lobby and a bullet hole in our room's window. I would never stay here again. The pictures are deceiving.\n",

      "Actual review: For all of you looking for a budget hotel with friendly staff and clean beds, please look elsewhere. The ladies, if you can call them that, who staffed the windows were beyond rude. I honestly could not believe how self-absorbed and obnoxious they were. My sheets had what I called \"mystery stains\" all over them, as did the top cover and spare blanket. The sheets looked like they'd been laundered. But the covers looked like they'd never seen the washer. I barely touched them, and you should do the same. They were filthy. On the contrary to other reviews, my bathroom was OK. It could have been worse. As a matter of fact, it was a lot like the dorm bathroom I used in college. Thank God for flip flops and Lysol. The TV was about 20 years old, with bad reception and barely 4 channels. But you don't come to NYC to sit in your room and watch TV. One great thing about this hotel is that if you aren't leaving NY until late in the day, and need a place to store your things, you can pay $1/bag to store them at the hotel. Also, the hotel is in an excellent location, just a block away from Times Square and the 42nd Street Subway. But there are other hotels in the area that offer better service and nice, clean rooms. Your best bet is to go with one of them instead.\n",

He and his spouse were in desparate need of some alone time. I searched the web and Pier 5 was just the type of hotel I was looking for. It looked unique and not the \"cookie cutter\" type hotel with all of the usual trimmings. The colors were beautiful and attention to details was not overlooked. My son and his spouse said they had a wonderful, relaxing time. The room was very clean and the bed was heavenly! The staff the encountered were helpful and knowledgeable. They ate dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse. They said the food was incredible. After dinner they took a stroll and said the night was just beautiful. Numerous places to eat or shop and conveniently located close to Pier 5.\n",

      "Actual review: I had business just a block away from this hotel, so I decided to give it a try. The building contains offices as well, so you take separate hotel elevators from the entrance floor to the lobby. The lobby is elegant and tasteful. You need your room key to go to any hotel floors above lobby level, which is a good thing in Baltimore. My room had a very high ceiling and a very nice bathroom with a stand up, glass walled shower and Aveda bath products. It was a spacious room with a nice flat screen TV. The bed was supposed to be a king, and maybe it was, but it was small in length and my 6' 2\" frame hung over it. Not sure it was the bed, but I did not sleep well for some reason. It happens. For Kimpton members, there was free internet access, of course, and also $10 for use at the in-room minibar. The gym was nice with a decent selection of equipment.\n",

      "Actual review: My boyfriend and I decided to go on our first weekend getaway to Philadelphia. We choose this hotel because the location was suppose to be close and convient to all the historical sties, which it was and wasn't. We ended up doing a lot of walking in order to get to the sites, which wasn't bad but it wasn't as close as they made it seem. We also choose this hotel because they offered some package deals, we decided to go with the 'sugar' package which included free overnight parking for one car, 20% the bill at the Keatings Restaurant in the hotel plus $10 free reward play cards at the Sugar House Casino for each person staying. First of all the parking garage was an inconvience to get to & from, you had to take at least 3 elevators to get to the hotel itself. So we basically had to take 2 trips to bring our stuff inside and when leaving. Now the hotel itself is quite nice on the inside, the staff was very friendly and personable. The restaurant/ bar had some good happy hour deals with drinks, not so much when it comes to the choices of tapas to choose from. The restaurant itself was nice but when it came to the choices of food, it was slim pickings especially since they ran out of the catch of the day. Also, our waiter was so rude and didn't even take our drink order until we were sitting down for 15 minutes, we didn't get any bread and had to ask for it when our meals came. The food itself was good but not great especially not for the price, my boyfriend ordered a steak that came with truffle fries that was $32 and it didn't even include a soup or salad. When it came to the dessert we asked for one of the limited choices and they didn't even have it. In the end we paid close to $130 for 2 entrees, 2 drinks and 2 desserts. Overall, I wouldn't recommed eating at the restaurant simply because the limited choices and the fact that it was overpriced. Case in point we went out to eat the next night in town and had a much much better meal, that included 2 appetizers, drinks, 2 entrees and dessert all for a little less that we paid at Kettings. Also, they didn't even take our 20% off and my boyfriend had to deal with getting it off at check out which caused an issue. Now when we got to our room we were disappointed with the fact that it was right outside of the elevator lobby so we would be hearing all the noise & interaction going to & from the elevator. Once inside the room we noticed that the doors to the bathroom were 2 french doors that didn't even close all the way, there was a thick opening so you could hear and see into it, also our toilet wasn't bolted down properly so everytime I went to sit down to pee it would move or make a huge noise as if it was going to come apart. Then when I washed my hands the hot water handle had unscrewed itself and I had to screw it back in place. Other than the bathroom the room itself was nice and clean. The bed was comfortable and we were lucky enough to have a view of the Delaware River. My finally complaint will be the fact that the first night we were there, there was a party on our floor with under aged kids drinking & smoking ( in a non smoking hotel) and screaming obscenities until 2 or 3 am. The security lady came up & spoke to them about \"keeping it down\" 3 or 4 times and they were even louder each time she left. On the fifth and final time she came up to talk to them, she finally kicked them out but not after it took at least 30 minutes to get them out of the room & into the elevator lobby which was right in front of our door. I basically got 4 hours of sleep because once 8am came around I was awoken by the screams of children wanting to press the elevator button followed by the parents screaming back at them. I don't understand why the Hyatt has signs everywhere asking their guests to be courteous and to keep the noise down when all I heard was yelling and screaming from either the kids partying or the children running & screaming. Overall I didn't have a good experience at this hotel, I know Hyatt's are nice hotels but honestly this one wasn't that good and I wouldn't recommed staying here.\n",

Having visited several hotels in New York this has good sized rooms, is really clean and they are contemporary. The Sky Bar has lovely views over the city and the barman made a mean cocktail.\n",

      "Actual review: This was my second stay at the Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn. The staff has always been courteous, pleasant and very attentive. The rooms are clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. On this trip I ate at the on-site restaurant and was very pleased with the quality of the food. I was doubly impressed when room service delivered a hot meal! The on-site bar has a great lounge atmosphere that plays music videos on several flat screen TV's. I truly enjoyed the pool area, especially in the evening when I could sit close to the outdoor fireplace. Overall, it was great experience staying here and I'm looking forward to my next trip.\n",

      "Actual review: This was a holiday trip with family members staying at the hotel. It has been redone and is really lovely. Our dog traveled with us and when booking the room, the lady even said she was looking forward to meeting our dog! They advertise as dog friendly and they are. There is a wonderful walking trail at the hotel that is great for the dogs. Rooms were very comfortable but the comforters had been washed (and should not have) and were matted and funny looking for sure. They need to change that. Anyway - all else great. Breakfast was more than just continental - had some real breakfast food and that was a nice surprise. We will be back.\n",

      "Actual review: I've had the privilege of being hosted at both Ritz Carltons in Boston, both in New York, and all four in the D.C. area. The Ritz Carlton Georgetown is definitely my favorite. This is not your typical Ritz Carlton.\n",
      "From the moment I was received at my car, the staff made me feel right at home. The lobby is very inviting, intimate, and cozy with soft lighting, comfortable, contemporary furniture and a warm fireplace. Also in the lobby is a historic display of rags to riches showing how the hotel was transformed from a garbage incinerator into a boutique luxury hotel. I was very intrigued by the artwork which consisted of anthing from murals made of paper bags to acrylic paint on aluminum. Very interesting.\n",
      "My room was on the 1st floor overlooking South Street, which was not the greatest of views, but I don't spend much time looking out the window anyway. It was a spacious room with an oversized marble bathroom that had a seperate tub and shower. The feather bed with egyptian cotton linen was very comfortable, like all the Ritz Carlton's I've been to. Since I don't have good luck with alarm clocks, the wake up call was much appreciated. Being a musician, the Bose dvd system was a very nice addition. I swear there's a sub woofer in that room somewhere!\n",
      "The food...oh the food...In my opinion the food at this hotel is second to none. It was described as American with Italian influence. All I know is that those were the best crab cakes I've ever tasted. End of story.\n",
      "Location, location. The Georgetown Ritz Carlton is located in the heart of Georgetown in between K and M streets. In my opinion it's location is even better than that of the Fourseasons. Georgetown is one of my favorite places in the US. Within walking distance of the hotel, you'll find anything from Upscale shopping to open-air markets. Definitely make time for a Strawberry Shake at Johnny Rocket's.\n",
      "Connected to the hotel is an awesome Leow's movie theatre, complete with captain chairs. Take my advice, take in a movie Leow's style.\n",
      "Oh, I almost forgot! There was a fitness center available 24 hrs a day with complimentary fruit and bottled water. And the Spa...I was totaly blown away by the fragrance. I didn't know candles could smell that good. After a long day of touring D.C. I would definitely recommend a relaxing message in their spa.\n",

Breakfast good, cereal, eggs, bagels, toast, but plastic plates, cups and cutlery. As earlier posts have said staff very helpful especially Mathew, staff booked our tours and transport back to JFK. Brendans also a good place to eat if you want to eat close by. Would stay again.\n",

The hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and also within walking distance of the double-decker sightseeing bus. Also about 4 blocks from the nearest metro stop. Conveniently located but also in a very quiet and residential neighborhood. Derek at the front desk was always courteous, knowledgeable and very attentive; had a very customer-friendly disposition. Overall, a great stay!\n",

      "Actual review: My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. We booked a standard room, no bay view was available, through Priceline.com for super cheap. My advice is to shop around to get the best deal for a room, since the hotel website can be pricey. Overall, we enjoyed this hotel. Here's a few pros/cons:\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Quiet street away from the major tourist spots, like Fisherman's Wharf (which is about 20-30 walk)\n",
      "2. Complimentary treats at specific times (beer, wine, cookies, milk, and ice cream). Served in main lobby. Because it was our anniversary, we were given a bottle of sweet wine and chocolate in our hotel room too:)\n",
      "3. Very friendly customer service.\n",
      "4. Nearby shops in market building and as mentioned, Pier 39 is only a short walk.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Upon arrival, our room wasn't ready so we waited for about 40 minutes.\n",
      "2. Valet parking is available $42.00 nightly. \n",
      "3. Rooms are very small.\n",
      "4. Homeless people hang out at street corners, but it seems like they are around every corner in San Francisco.\n",

      "Actual review: This hotel is very convenient to Graceland, and also very quiet, but has the most uncomfortable mattresses that I have ever tried to sleep on in my life. It felt like I was laying on a big bag of flour. Needless to say, there was little sleeping while I was at this hotel. I was shocked to see reviews saying the beds were so comfortable. The mattresses are made of foam and are well worn and lumpy. The room also smelled loudly of a chemical room spray which greatly bothered me. When I returned home, my clothes had absorbed that smell. I was miserable and glad to leave. The hotel lobby was nice, and the workers seemed to be working hard to do their jobs, but sleeping and breathing are important to me.\n",
