      "Actual review: My husband and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. We normally stay at very high class hotels but that night we wanted to try something new without spending a fortune. (St. Regis, Ritz, etc are our norms) We wanted the Tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel (unassuming front) The Bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away. While checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say Happy Anniversary. Being Starwood platinum, we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade. We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before. Now that I know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us, I will go back soon. We go into the city a lot and I will for sure go back!! Thank you so much Sheraton! You wowed us!!\n",

Yes, there is a large number of homeless people walking around the neighborhood, but they didnt bother me. Large shopping center and excellent restaurants in Gaslight quarter outside your door.

      "Actual review: For the past year and a half, my daughter has been fighting cancer. We have had to travel to both Dallas and Houston for treatment, and the Crowne Plaza has always been there to offer a clean, inexpensive, convienent, and hospitable place for us to stay. Our last stay was at the River Oaks Crowne Plaza in Houston, Texas, and as always, the hotel was there when we needed them. Everything from the help at the front desk to help finding a place to eat was taken care of. Mandy, the concierge, was extremely knowledgable concerning local restaurants, shuttles, and even a taxi with comfortable seats and a non smoking atmosphere to take my wife and daughter to the airport only 3 days out of major surgery. We will always seek out a Crowne Plaza to stay at when available, and will always recommend them to friends and family when needing a place to stay. The Crowne Plaza is one of the unsung heros in our fight to rid our daughter of cancer.\n",

      "Actual review: Great Value for a King, Queen, and Princesses. We stayed at the Pacific Terrace with our two daughters (3.5 and 8 months old) for five nights in early March. The hotel was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It looked even better in person than on the hotel website. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our \"partial-oceanview.\" The room was roomy. I wish the beds weren't so high off the ground since I have two young children, but the rooms were beautiful. There was a big flat screen T.V. The sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready. There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing. I found the convenience of the parking well worth the $15. This was such a great value. We would definitely go back in a heart beat.\n",
