      "Text: My husband and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. We normally stay at very high class hotels but that night we wanted to try something new without spending a fortune. (St. Regis, Ritz, etc are our norms) We wanted the Tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel (unassuming front) The Bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away. While checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say Happy Anniversary. Being Starwood platinum, we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade. We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before. Now that I know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us, I will go back soon. We go into the city a lot and I will for sure go back!! Thank you so much Sheraton! You wowed us!!\n",

We have had to travel to both Dallas and Houston for treatment, and the Crowne Plaza has always been there to offer a clean, inexpensive, convienent, and hospitable place for us to stay. Our last stay was at the River Oaks Crowne Plaza in Houston, Texas, and as always, the hotel was there when we needed them. Everything from the help at the front desk to help finding a place to eat was taken care of. Mandy, the concierge, was extremely knowledgable concerning local restaurants, shuttles, and even a taxi with comfortable seats and a non smoking atmosphere to take my wife and daughter to the airport only 3 days out of major surgery. We will always seek out a Crowne Plaza to stay at when available, and will always recommend them to friends and family when needing a place to stay. The Crowne Plaza is one of the unsung heros in our fight to rid our daughter of cancer.\n",

      "Text: Great Value for a King, Queen, and Princesses. We stayed at the Pacific Terrace with our two daughters (3.5 and 8 months old) for five nights in early March. The hotel was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It looked even better in person than on the hotel website. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our \"partial-oceanview.\" The room was roomy. I wish the beds weren't so high off the ground since I have two young children, but the rooms were beautiful. There was a big flat screen T.V. The sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready. There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing. I found the convenience of the parking well worth the $15. This was such a great value. We would definitely go back in a heart beat.\n",

Space, comfort, well equipped rooms, a choice of pools, an impressive spa and a well-equipped gym with a consistently high quality standard of service throughout. Details have been looked after and lessons learned from the sometimes antiseptic feel of the high-end chains. The food is excellent with the Addison worth a visit in itself. The golf course is fantastically maintained and tuition is hands-on and effective. An instant favourite\n",

Not the least expensive spot in town, but I defy you to find a hotel of this caliber that offers suites of this size at lower prices. You won't. Since the hotel is freshly renovated, every inch of the property is spotless & fresh. We had a London Suite on the 17th floor which was silent when the windows were closed. Our suite had a parlor which was separated from the bedroom by a small entryway & a very well-lit bathroom, which was enormous. The huge mirrors on the bathroom wall were separated by fabulous light panels that made makeup application a breeze. In addition, the shower area was ~9' x 4' with a \"rain shower\" type fixture on one end, and a \"shower massage\" fixture on the other. There was also a Euro hand-held fixture, so the bases were covered regarding your showering options. The bed offered super deluxe pillow-top comfort, and the pillows were fab. The linens were very high thread-count sateen. The ambiance is minimalist/elegant in the suites & throughout the hotel. Didn't try the restaurant/bar. Loved every moment that we were there & look forward to returning. Hopefully their discounted rate will continue forever.\n",

When checking in remember to asked for the bar key so you can store beverages in the refrigerator. Room 402, was the suite, large bathrooom, no closet space, nice room, fireplace, but the sofa bed was terrible. In addition, the heater did not work, so I had to order additional blankets to get warm...even received a slight cold upon return. Room 402 did have a view, they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night. Did not asked for a discount; they told me to contact Manager who was unable at the time each time I inquired. The Corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not (may be the government rate). The coffee in the morning was great; did not attend the wine party. Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great. If you book a room, asked for the courtyard view if possibe. Location is everything at this site; everything you need is right in the area. Pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance. Do you go the aquarium; not worth the price.\n",

I e-mailed the manager, Wes Tyler, several times prior to our trip with questions and he always responded promptly, which was a nice touch. I'm not sure one would get this at a larger hotel. EVERYTHING about our stay at the Chancellor more than met our expectations. We had booked shuttle service from the airport with Lorrie's, which I found on the hotel's website and which I'm sure saved us considerable time as we were unfamiliar with getting around San Francisco. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not yet ready, but we had expected this and left our bags to go on an Alcatraz tour. When we returned, we went to our room which, as requested prior to our arrival, was a corner room with a view of Union Square (room 1203). Surprise! Waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine, two Chancellor wine glasses, gift-wrapped photo frame, and nice note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our recent marriage. What a way to welcome your guests! The room was painted in lovely shades of green and taupe, with nice prints on the walls. The bed had a soft white comforter and many pillows. Television, armchairs, dressers, lamps, etc. were more than adequate. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies for the four nights we were there. The bathroom was plenty big for the both of us, and well-appointed with soap, shampoo, lotion, tissues, cotton balls and Q-Tips, hair dryer, and makeup mirror (plus the rubber ducky was a cute touch!). The ceiling fan and open windows provided more than enough ventilation. The large closet was much appreciated, as was the iron, ironing board, and in-room safe. The room was very quiet at all times, and street noise was not bothersome. All of the staff that we encountered were efficient, friendly, and helpful--particularly Steve (helped us with restaurant reservations), Susie (answered transportation questions and arranged shuttle service back to SFO), and Matt (brought our bags to the room). Everyone that we saw truly seemed to enjoy working at the hotel. We visited both the bar and restaurant and had pleasant experiences along with moderately priced, tasty meals/drinks. As many reviewers have previously noted, the location of the Chancellor can't be beat for just about anything a tourist would want to do in San Francisco, particularly shopping and dining. If we ever return to San Francisco (which I sincerely hope to do, because I fell in love with it), there is no way I would stay anywhere other than the Chancellor. THANK YOU!\n",

      "Text: My family and I stayed a long fall weekend at the Ritz-Carlton, Boston and overall very much enjoyed our stay. As previously noted in reviews, the hotel is more modern than many other Ritz-Carlton's, but we still found it welcoming. We had an executive suite, which had enough room for our family of 5 with a rollaway (3 children under the age of 9). The room was nicely decorated, and the king bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. I was not impressed with the quality of the sofa bed, but at least they gave us a featherbed topper to put on top of it. The bathrooms were outstanding, in particular the full bath in the bedroom, and I really liked having a \"coat closet\" in the front foyer. The location of the hotel is convenient to most attractions, but it's in a rather random few blocks on the edge of Chinatown and in the middle of a couple of schools, so there are a lot of students and bars. There are not a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity (2 block radius) , however that is not a huge consideration for most people.\n",
      "On the slight downside, the staff was helpful, but not overly so - I've had more helpful staff at other similar hotels, but that alone would not dissuade me from the Ritz-Carlton Boston. For me, the biggest downside (which was still rather minor) is that they really didn't make any accommodations for the kids. Frequently at similar hotels, there will be a small treat waiting for the kids in the room (coloring book or similar), or the housekeepers will do something sweet with their beds (a treat, or tucking in their doll, etc.) - but really they were pretty much overlooked during our stay. I did note in the book in our room that they offered amenities for the kids - bathrobes, etc. - but there were none in our room and it wasn't worth it for me to call housekeeping. Note, this was a minor detail on a very nice stay - it was not that the kids were unwelcome, and everyone was very kind to them.\n",
      "Overall, we had a great trip, and a lovely stay at the Ritz-Carlton Boston. Would we stay there again? Perhaps - but I'd probably look around for other options, in particular if the kids were with us. For me, it felt best suited to a business traveler, but comfortable nevertheless.\n",

When we checked in we asked for a king with a sofa bed. Was told they were completely sold out. She even checked with the manager and she said the same thing. We are platinum members so we are supposed to be abe to get upgraded rooms if available. We were fine with her answer so we got our key and went to our room. After a few hours the A/C unit in our room started making a horribly loud noise. We couldn't hear anything over it. Maintenance couldn't fix it so they moved us to a different room. Surprisingly, it was a king room with a sofa bed. Pretty sure that's what I asked for in the first place, but whatever. It was a corner room with views of the river and it was literally the most amazing view. That view was almost worth the troubles. Except at 2:00 am this A/C unit started making the very same noise. Really?? So irritating. There was no way we were dragging all of luggage to a different room in the middle of the night. I turned the A/C completely off and tried to sleep. Not the best when it's been 100 degrees outside all day. I called the manager the next morning and he refunded the points we used for the room I feel he could've done more than that but at that point we just wanted out of the hotel. When we were leaving our room I heard over the maintenance radio that someone else was also having problems with a noisy A/C unit. I'm thinking it's time to replace the A/C units.\n",

The smaller room held a double (or queen?) bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed. With the sofa away, we had a large lounge area with coffee table - perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of San Franciso.\n",
      "This kids also enjoyed the pool - which was outdoors but heated. Nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food, including a Walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies (there was a fridge in the kids room). The Irish pub next door has a fantastic dinner buffet, and the bar around the corner has a champagne happy hour and live music (for Mum & Dad's time out).\n",
      "My tip for family's is to use the BART to travel back to the airport. We easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us (yes 7) to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean BART train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus. More money to spend in the wonderful shops in Chinatown!\n",

Well, that's exactly what happened and we ended up stay at this hidden little paradise instead of winging it and spending the night at a motel. Quite honestly, probably the best decision we made. The check in process at Kona Kai was quick, we were charged a decent amount for parking, and the rest was beautiful, beautiful experience.\n",

Their decor, I would have to describe as \"quaint\" and \"cute.\" Honestly, the carpet, and whatever else may have been outdated- really didn't matter!! We open up the two doors and it opened right up to the beach. The most gorgeous views, and Kona Kai played it RIGHT! I loved how humble the room came off as, while boasting such a beautiful property. There was a big, sparkling pool next to a great little hot jacuzzi.\n",

      "Text: Visiting Philadelphia on leisure for two days and two nights, my wife and I elected to stay at the Sofitel based on the positive reviews on this and other websites. We were not disappointed. Paying only a little above $200 per night, we got a very spacious suite - a corner one at that - and the experience was impressive in every aspect. The service was friendly, professional, and efficient. The valet parking (which cost us a mere $30 total) meant that our car was ready at the door when we wanted it, and upon arriving back at the hotel, we could just get out of the car and go back to our room. Very convenient. The decoration and styling of the hotel is not as \"gaudy\" and \"florid\" as some other high-end brands, but the look is very elegant, modern, and artistic no less. You might call it luxury without ostentation. The suite was most accomodating in every way, from the numerous spacious closets, to the heavenly comofortable bed, to the well-stocked refrigerator bar, and the wall finishings and all the furniture. Oh, and the bathroom - extremely impressive. It was tremendous, with two sinks, a comfortable bath, and a spacious shower. If I had to find anything to quibble about, I could say that the wireless internet should have been free rather than $10/day (though I was able to get a free signal from a nearby hotel....), and it would be nice if the bathroom would have a jacuzzi rather than a plain bathtub (though strictly speaking, it was actually a \"Jacuzzi\" brand bathtub, but anyway....). Can't speak for the bar/restaurant as we did not partake. Don't forget to bring cash to tip the valets, room service, and bellhops! All in all you can't go wrong with this hotel, certainly at the price we paid. Strongly recommended. We would easily stay there again.\n",

The hallways boast very luxurious marble floors and walls. There is a unique set of glass artwork on every floor and the lobby has soothing spa-like music to really help you relax the moment you walk in. Did I mention checking in was a snap? The front desk staff were very friendly and more than willing to go over and above to help us with finding our way around, helping us with our bags (Great personal service that you'd only find at small hotels). The concierge there, Vinh, is exceptional. He has first hand experience of the area being a DC native and recommended to us some local favorites like Marrakesh (7-course Morrocan dinner with live belly dancer), Phillips (all you can eat seafood right by the waterfront).\n",
      "The designers spared no expense in making you feel very pampered. The trend of marble floors and artwork continue onward into the Guest Rooms themselves. The furnishings have a very modern and contemporary flare. The rooms are bright, spacious, and luxurious. My girlfriend loved sleeping on the down pillows/comforter. The hotel provides guests with bathroom amenities from L'Occitane, a very high end french brand. The showers themselves are state of the art with a massaging jet function, a real treat at the end of the day of sight seeing!\n",

Located on the same block to a CVS and 3 blocks from a Safeway. A friendly and personable staff that is willing to serve you and make you happy. In room spa services.

We stayed in a queen suite with a fold out couch. The room was beautiful, and the whole hotel was immaculate. I can't comment on service, since we didn't order any, but the location was great. It was within walking distance of the pier and many other Chicago attractions. There was also an awesome pizza place right next door.

When I was called to the city on sudden business, I checked the Astoria's rates and found them to be astonishingly low for the hotel's location. I also checked Trip Advisor and saw mixed reviews. Based on what I read, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I decided to go ahead and stay at the Astoria -- I needed a cheap place to stay.\n",
      "Maybe it's because I didn't hold high hopes for the Astoria, but my stay there was a pleasant one. The hotel reminds me very much of places I've stayed in London -- small lift, narrow staircases.\n",
      "My room, which had an attached bath (I understand that some rooms do not have an ensuite, another similarity to small London hotels), was rather spartan (there is a television but no clock radio) but very clean. The very large window looked onto a small patio and could be opened widely for lots of fresh air. My room was very quiet too. While I could hear people pass in the hallway now and then, I did not hear guests talking in their rooms or watching television. It was peaceful.\n",
      "The bathroom was immaculate. In fact, I am hard-pressed to remember a cleaner hotel bathroom in my more recent travels. In terms of amenities, you will want to bring your own hair dryer, but the hotel does provide a shower cap, soap, and shampoo -- very basic toiletries on par with what you might find at a Red Roof Inn.\n",
      "The hotel's location is fantastic. The Montgomery BART station is two blocks away. Union Square and shopping heaven are two blocks down and one over. Chinatown is literally right outside the door. For people who want a bit more than the Astoria's continental breakfast, there is a Starbucks right across the street, another one a block down, and several pubs and cafes in between.\n",
      "Overall, my experience at the Astoria was great. It's clean and functional, and while it might not be the ideal setting for a romantic weekend getaway or a luxurious vacation, it's perfect for people who just need a convenient, clean, economical, well-situated place to crash. I will definitely be staying there again.\n",

Quirky decorations and a stylish lobby are great but since I'm not living there I can live without them. If you're like me then this hotel really hovers somewhere between 3 and 4 circles- if you are in to the boutique thing then this is a 4-circle hotel for sure.\n",
      "First the good news. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff is friendly and efficient (overall). But like a lot of boutique hotels you get a pretty small space to work in. This room inspired the punchchline \"when I put the key in the front door I broke the back window.\" They have a desk but the TV is mounted right above it so while I like working with the TV on I don't get into the front row movie theater experience and so couldn't do without resorting to sitting on the bed. And the bathroom is classic NYC hotel- if you are over 6' tall (I am not) you could possibly hit your knee on the wall when you sit on the toilet unless you ride side saddle (can that be done safely?).\n",
      "The breakfast buffet is definitely up to par (except in rare occasions can you really get excited about a breakfast buffet). They have good quality food for the full buffet and good enough for the cold (those little boxes of cereal are always okay). The lone waiter bordered on indifferent and gets a demerit for giving himself a 20% gratuity for a buffet. I later was told by the manager that 20% is \"industry standard\" for buffet service so they add it for your convenience. I have actually never had that added to my bill for a buffet breakfast at any other hotel in the United States (I was a party of 1). Plus 20% for almost no service (it's a buffet, people!). But I realize that some people tip the guy at McDonald's for handing them their food so for those people I'm sure this would be a non-issue. \n",
      "Dinner food was very good and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. Yes, they did add the \"industry standard\" 20% gratuity to the room service tab- that one I have seen everywhere before so no issue there.\n",
      "So would I come back if I needed to be in this part of town- probably. It's a well run hotel in a good location and my company got a very good rate, making it a great value versus most nearby hotels.\n",

There is also a nice selection of restaurants near by to suite a variety of budgets. The Barking Dog Cafe is right next door and is really good. \n",

The hotel is a Kimpton, which always makes me happy - robes, free wi-fi, wine hour, and a very reasonable upgrade plan. The view from the city view rooms at dusk and dawn are worth it - especially if you can get a photo! The Hudson Suite - one of their premier suites on each floor offers a beautiful Hudson view. I think I have stayed in every size room this hotel offers and I am always comfortable. The bath products are either Aveda or Italian and when you have a soaking tub they leave you salts, The soaking tubs are so worth the room upgrade but all of the bathrooms are top-notch. I have not had an inside room which might be a bit claustrophobic but the lobby lounge is a comfortable hangout spot with a giant wooden table and comfy chairs. I have also dined at the in-house restaurant Print and the food is consistently delicious. The Press Lounge is a great place for a drink while you soak in the city views.

We were on the 11th floor across from the elevators. We could hear the subway, but could not feel it, it really didn't bother us all that much. Another reviewer mentioned that Little Italy was disappointing. Well, it is only two blocks these days as China Town is taking over. The two blocks of Little Italy are great, the only disappointment is that there is not more of it. The taxi ride, with tip, to Time Square ranged from $16-$20 if you are wondering.

Great stay if you are doing something at the convention center next door. Easy walk to the Gas Lamp district. Joes Crab shack is just right behind the building, which is highly recommended. The hotel does have nice bars & food inside, though again, pricey. I would certainly stay here again, especially when my company is paying for it!\n",

      "Text: Stayed here 5 nights Apr 6-10, 1 adult w two teenagers. Very polite and professional staff, from front desk, bellhop, housekeeping, concierge, etc. Felt safe walking around this area even at night. Rooms are tight but this IS NYC. Location couldn't have been better for our purposes (touring/college visits) Subway station less than a block away. Grand Central, NY Public Library, Bryant Park, 5th Avenue shopping just a couple blocks over. Easy walk to Times Square but far enough away from the maddening crowds. Only issues - 1) TV didn't work in first room but was reassigned next morning no problem. They even sent up a technician when we called about 11:00 PM to report the issue. 2) My laptop got \"lost\" in baggage storage - we checked out of room and had to store our bags with the bellhop while we finished up a few last minute errands. While loading the car, I didn't notice that the laptop wasn't there. As much my fault as bellhop's as I didn't count the claim tickets as I was a bit overwhelmed trying to pack the car in front of the hotel on busy Lexington Ave and just wanted to get out of the way. Upon arrival at our next stop (Boston), I discovered the loss and called the hotel. Manager immediately connected me with Hotel Security and they made arrangements for the laptop to be shipped wherever I wanted immediately. I directed them to send it to my home as we had a few more stops on our road trip and am awaiting arrival now. Hotel security called me this morning to see if I had received it yet and when I hadn't, he provided me with the tracking number and asked that I call to confirm receipt. Very professional and responsive despite my somewhat frazzled state. \n",
      "Regarding the renovations, there was a notice about this on the reservation page and we did not find it to be a problem at all. Our first room was on the 10th floor, then moved up to 19th after the TV problem. At neither room did we find noise to be an issue. \n",

The nice big tvs in the rooms had a shelf near it that looked convenient if I had brought a video game console. However from what I could tell, there were only had composite video inputs and not the hdmi I would have preferred. Also, the hd channels on the tv weren't on the hotel provided channel listings, but were there way past of all the other sd channels and seemed to be a pretty random selection of what was there. The shower was designed to not need any sort of curtain or door, but it seemed to me that to make it work and not get water all over the bathroom the shower head was pointed towards a corner and was not adjustable at all. That made the very roomy shower seem kinda cramped as I had to huddle in the corner of the shower to stay in the water flow.\n",

The staff were very helpfull and the desk clerks were dressed in black, and it was down at the end of lonely street.\n",
      "Graceland is just across the road,and you can go up to see elvis' grave every morning from 7-30 till 8-30. You can catch the sun tour bus down into memphis through the day, which comes every hour and the hotel shuttle bus at night which you book at the desk and drops you off near beale st.\n",
      "We didn't have a problem with the hotel, apart from the fact that the jungle room bar could be a bit bigger. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at heartbreak hotel, and all the staff were really helpfull and friendly. We would go back tomorrow if we could, We are starting to save up for our next trip and we will be going to heartbreak hotel. First time i have ever been to the usa, and it was my dream come true absolutley brilliant.\n",

      "Text: Although, I live just 12 miles from midtown Manhattan, occasionally I stay in the city because of business. Last week was one of those times; I decided to try Ink 48 (in general I am a fan of Kimpton hotels). Ink 48 is a truly wonderful hotel. It's fresh, clean, spacious, and is most attractive and appealing. The staff are extremely nice (that goes a long way with me) as well. I stayed in a deluxe room (there was a special rate) on the 14th floor with a view of 11th Ave looking east -- it was simply fantastic! One word about the hotel's location -- it's a little off the beaten path, but if you are reasonably fit you can easily walk from the hotel to Time Square in less than 10 minutes. The subway is also just three (long) crosstown blocks away. Cabs are everywhere; buses are just one block over. Over the years I have stayed in at least 25 NYC hotels. Ink 48 is now officially my favorite.\n",

      "Text: The main reason why I booked this hotel was its location and it certainly did not disappoint! You can't go wrong being literally next door to Grand Central and only 10-15 minutes away from all major attractions, not to mention the great food choices that won't break the bank found nearby on 3rd Ave. Try the Libretto Pizzeria on 3rd and you'll love the food as well as the homemade NY favorites- cannoli and tiramisu were the best I had! Just a side note. Anyhow, the hotel room itself was nothing special- room was very small but the bathroom I found designed for a little child and not for adults so this was the worst thing about the room. However, I knew going in that Manhattan hotels had tiny rooms so I wasn't expecting anything. Keep in mind that there is no way more than two people could be comfortable in one room so get two rooms if you are three or more in number. Hotel staff were friendly and attentive to all my questions and issues with the room. TV reception is horrible and I complained about it but was told nothing can be done- I assumed all the tall buildings cause reception problems so it didnt bother me much- was out all day anyways. I didn't appreciate all the nickel and diming they did with the costly WiFi charges, charges for using the hotel phone for toll free and even local charges, or the final surprising charge that I'd never encountered before which was for luggage storage upon check out. They charge per piece of luggage which I didn't appreciate. But I figured that this is NY so was expecting to be ripped off here and there. Overall, this was an excellent first time visit to NYC and we had a great time. Can't wait to go back again and will definitely stay at the Hyatt each time I visit because again, it's location can't be beat by any other major NYC hotel in the area. All of Manhattan was right outside my doorstep and I loved it!!\n",

I ended up here because I registered for the conference late and this was the only place left. It was also the most reasonable price wise. The front desk staff were excellent, very friendly, cheerful, and accommodating. On check in I asked about check out times and if I could keep my luggage until I left for the airport. The front desk staff changed my check out time at no charge in order to accommodate my schedule. The room came with a small fridge and microwave, fabulous! Given the heat and humidity this was a welcome amenity! There was plenty of space in the room, tons of pillows, and the beds were comfortable. I would have no problem staying here again. So what are those areas needing upgrades? As with most older hotels the elevators can be slow and crowded when the place is full. The elevator lobbies on each floor is very narrow. There really is no room to accommodate people with luggage waiting to get on and people coming off the elevator with luggage. I was on the fifth floor so I always took the stairs to go down and only used the elevator to go up. The stairs are definitely not pretty!!!! There was free wireless internet but the service was really slow. I made do and I find this to be fairly common when on the road. At least I didn't have to pay for the slow internet! \n",
      "I ate breakfast there my first morning. Understand I was there for an Infection Control conference when I say what I am about to say! I was seated at a table for four. The half of the table I was seated at was visibly wet, very wet. They must still be using a rag and bucket of solution to clean tables. Whoever wiped half the table did not wring out the rag very well. Not to mention they should not be doing this in the first place. Then the coffee mugs were set on the table upside down so the lip you drink from is sitting in the wet dirty solution. Needless to say I moved to the dry side of the table. Wait, what? Half the table was wet and half dry? I can only guess that only the side someone else sat was cleaned. I asked for just two eggs, once over, and toast. Well I got that plus fried potatoes, which I didn't want, nor did I eat. And I was of course charged an arm and a leg for it! She did not hear me, maybe it was my Midwestern accent! lol. Listen up restaurants, please don't put mugs upside down on a table and then expect me to drink out of it! That's what saucers or paper coasters are for! I did not eat there again.\n",

Everyone here must have taken the Four Seasons school of customer service, and it shows. There was some concern at check-in and check out. Lines are a little longer than expected. No level of detail has been overlooked in the design of the hotel. Everything is modern, new, fresh and up to date. Things are done with a modern flair, but it is comfortable and welcoming. The rooms are wonderful. Complimentary wireless internet, firm but comfortable beds, flat screen TVs, both in the room and the bathroom, fluffy bathrobes, Ipod docking machines and more. The bathrooms have dual sinks, a separate toilet area, and gigantic walk in showers. The rooms are about 500 square feet and are very spacious and comfortable. The design is very modern and up to date and as the hotel itself is relatively new, things look great. The casino of course is the main focus of the hotel, and sadly since it allows smoking, it can be a bit of a turn off for those of us who don't enjoy second hand smoke. The restaurants are okay, but extremely overpriced. We ate at Bourbon Steak and while it was a good meal, the bill came to $250 and that's with just only one glass of wine each. Wolfgang Puck for breakfast was a big disappointment, and again, priced as if you were eating at the Ritz in Paris. Also watch out for the valet parking - they put a scratch on our vehicle and it was never resolved. The room rates are always quite high, so don't expect any bargains here. This hotel is for people who can shell out the dough, or those who are big players and somehow get their rooms at reduced rates or fully comped.

The lobby and reception area are cool and peaceful, with a wine bar right in the center. Even got a chance to try the hotel restaurant - Aria - which was excellent, except for clueless service bringing everything at once...what? But the food is quite good and left me wanting to try it again - warm nan-like bread with dipping sauces to start, gratis, a nice touch.\n",

We arrived in Phoenix rather late and had a very early flight on the return, so wanted to stay near the airport on either end of the trip. We selected the Fairfield because of its proximity to the airport, the complimentary shuttle and, of course(!), Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The hotel staff were all very nice (Jake and Jenny at the front desk, and Mark and Tim driving the shuttle). The room and the property were clean, the bed was very comfortable, and overall it was very quiet. However, if you're looking for a lively atmosphere, then Tempe, home of Arizona State University, is only 3 miles away. There were also plenty of restaurants there, as well. Unfortunately, if you don't have a car (as we didn't at the end of our trip since we'd turned it back in), your choices are limited, which could be a negative. However, the shuttle drivers, even though it's not advertised and I doubt you could demand this service, were kind enough to drive us the three miles, which worked out great. In short, for a clean, quiet and convenient place that's close to Sky Harbor International, I would recommend this hotel.\n",

Since the two sleeping areas are on opposite ends of the suite, separated by a bathroom and if parents are in sound sleep from a day of exploring, they might not hear if an early riser child should get inquisitive and head out!

The front desk offered us great restaurant / night life suggestions and helped us in planning our sight-seeing. Compared to some other hotels in the back bay area, the price was just right. All-in-all, I give this hotel 4.5 out of 5!\n",

      "Text: This is not a gripe but I have 4 issues with regards to my stay. First I booked thru Hotwire and I got a ridiculously low rate which is really great for me but for the first time i felt like a second class guest here. Why? First, the room they gave us was nice at first glance but upon closer scrutiny there were minor problems like the shower head was defective, the toilet had a leak, and the knob in one of the lampshades was missing. Second the location was right in front of the tracks so if you are a light sleeper then better bring some earplugs. Third we stayed for 6 days and upon checking in I requested for a fridge since I had my family with me. They told me that they will bring it to my room as soon as it becomes available. It never came although the rooms next to us received theirs even if I came earlier. I know what I am talking about because I saw the refrigerators out side the rooms near us. Lastly there were 3 occassions that I had to call the cleaning ladies attention with regards to our daily supply of toiletries which she forgot. I have been using Hotwire for the past couple of years and never has this happened to me. I was always treated as if I was a regular paying guest. Anyway as I've said, this is not a complaint just an observation. If someone asks me if I would like to stay again at the Hilton Gaslamp I would definitely say yes. The location is fantastic, the front desk staff were friendly, and the ambiance was terrific. I've stayed in 4-5 stars hotel in San Diego since 2003 and I have to admit this is the best. The issues I raised did not really bother us for we were always out enjoying San Diego. Lastly, will I still patronize Hotwire? You bet I will. I hope this becomes a wake up call for both Hotwire and the Hilton.\n",

Except that after filling forms and providing information, we received a dry email informing us that the request has been rejected. The reason: Starwood could not verify the lower price on Expedia. And why would they, considering that they waited 48 hours before checking, at which point the sale was over?\n",
      "So we didn't receive the price guarantee, but that didn't dampen our pleasure at Aloft Harlem. A testament to the gentrification of the neighborhood, the hotel is as stylish as any other in the chain, but the service is what sets it apart. And that's quite an achievement. Anyone we met - anyone - was friendly, thoughtful and accommodating. From the receptionist who initiated changing our room to a quiet one, even before we had the wits to ask, to the chambermaid who suggested convenient time to come by.\n",

We had tried all week to get a proper update on what we were coming to and were not clear as information from both the Hilton group and Expedia was very limited. After saving hard all year for this holiday we decided to go for it. We arrived to find the hotel in complete darkness and were met by Jatin the hotel manager. I have to say that he became our guardian angel and allayed any fears we may have had. Jatin took control for us and tried to contact Expedia on our behalf to see what alternative arrangements could be made. This is when things got difficult as the silence from expedia was deafening. Jatin explained that our only option was to stay that night and if the power did not come on then he would look at other options for us. Thankfully the power came on at 5am and we were good to go. Thereafter we could not have been in a better hotel, location and with excellent staff all round it ended up a fantastic holiday. The hotel and staff cater for your every need and nothing is to much trouble. The room was on the small side but very comfortable. the breakfast and the all day coffee were excellent and there was always something that you could eat and cookies in the afternoon were a nice touch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definatley stay here again as the value for money is there for all to see. Once again a massive thankyou to Jatin and his excellent team.\n",

They have free fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and milk in the lobby at night. Pet friendly with valet and real restaurant. I missed the continental breakfast so can't comment on that. My room looked just like the site photos. No free parking. The downtown self park is just as much as the valet My room was neat and clean. They go for the white clean bedspreads rather than weird floral ones. Had the standard little desk and TV. Free bottled water in your room, real glassware. Yes, it a little on the small side but certainly not unreasonable. Support your local businesses people, not everything has to be huge and brand spanking new.

However, charging for wifi is ridiculous and I was surprised that there was no refrigerator in the room at a hotel this nice. Also, housekeeping didn't replenish the washcloths when they cleaned and they didn't take all the dirty towels (even though we laid them right beside the tub). $2.50 for a 20 oz pop always kills me (seriously? what a rip off). Maybe that's just Boston pricing, but in Ohio that's a lot. No pop machines on the floors, meaning I had to travel from the 10th floor down to the lobby to get my $2.50 bottle of pop. Concierge was very helpful and the free shuttle to the airport was nice. We used the shuttle at one point to take us to the airport, where we took the subway to get into the city. There's no inexpensive option for getting from the hotel to the city, since you have to get across the harbor. The water taxi was neat and we did that once, but it was $17 per person round trip. Regular taxi was about $25 one way. Not sure how much the subway was, but it was in between the water taxi and regular taxi price-wise. Overall, very nice hotel, but I was surprised about the wifi charges and lack of the little \"perks\" you'd expect at a hotel such as this.\n",

We enjoyed the heated pool and jaccuzzi. We were able to walk to a 24 hour family restaurant and convenience store closeby. To our surprize when we asked what bus to take to the attractions they said '\"we will sign you up which time do you want to go\"? and \"we will pick you up.\" They even one nite drive us down to \"Old Town\" so we could tour area and have dinner. If you are traveling without a car, this is the place to stay. You are close to public transportation but staff will van you to your point of interest. If you plan to go to San Diego to go to Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, or other attractions this is your hotel. Also they are family friendly, offer AAA discount and other discounts. We stayed for less than $70. a nite. This is a must stay!!!!!!!!\n",

The room we booked, a corner suite, has one of the best views of the downtown. Our room was huge. In addition to the regular 2 Queen beds in one room and a sleeper sofa in the other room, there was an additional seating area in the living room with five windows giving a wonderful view of downtown. The room was spotless and clean each day during our 3 night stay at the hotel. The front desk was extraordinarily nice and gave helpful information when ever we needed. A simple question, like finding a bakery in town, was handled fast. Each person at the hotel, from the front desk to the maids cleaning rooms, and the people working at the cooked-to-order breakfast had a touch of \"southern hospitality\" and were extremely knowledgeable about the places to visit and eat within the city. The breakfast had cooked-to-order omelets, pancakes, waffles, a variety of fruits, yogurts, juices, cereals, and pastries. In the evening, the hotel featured nightly manager reception with mixed drinks, wines, beers, sodas, fruit, chips, vegetables, and other snacks. Although the hotel is a little farther away from the \"tourist loop\" of the riverwalk, it is still close enough to visit the Rivercenter and Alamo within a few minutes by walking. This Embassy Suites is one of the nicest hotels I have visited and I will definitely return to this hotel in the future.\n",

And the view from the glass elevators made the morning trips down to breakfast and to the start of the meetings so enjoyable. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The only problem was that I could not get the room to a comfortable temperature. Even when I turned the A/C off completely, it was still cold! But, since I didn't spend much time in the room, it wasn't a big deal. Just bundled up good at night. The breakfasts were great. I didn't use the restaurant (although it seemed kinda small) but did spend about an hour in the bar area one night when I just couldn't seem to wind down. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. One other minor complaint, and this is at no fault of the hotel, was that my room was on the front side of the hotel and there was roadwork being done on Baymeadows that started about 9pm each night. Kinda noisy and there were some flashing yellow/orange caution lights that made their way through the curtains. If you're planning a trip in the next week or so, I would call the hotel to see if they're still doing roadwork there, and if so, request a room towards the back of the hotel. The only other complaint would be that the side door that I used to enter and exit the hotel seemed to be the general smoking area for the hotel staff and any other guests. Being a non-smoker, it wasn't very pleasant to have to walk through the blue cloud of smoke every time I left or came back. After the 3rd time, I just started using the front entrance instead.\n",

The restaurant at the top of the hill was fabulous!! Even if you just go to the Terrace Room for drinks, you can enjoy the view. If you are a Hilton Member, you get an awesome buffet breakfast for free every morning! Workout room did get a little crowded in the mornings, but there is also a great walking/hiking trail right next to the resort and tennis courts. It was also a short 20 minute drive from the airport.\n",

We thought it would be an adventure staying in a \"Charming European-Style. Hotel. Located In The Heart Of Downtown\" San Francisco. Instead we found a decaying old building that had been covered over with a coat of cheap paint and cheap carpet. It stank of mildew and hadn't had a good cleaning in quite some time. Although the pillow cases and sheets had been changed, the pillows were old and stained, as was the mattress and quilt. Truly not an invitation for a restful night. I'm sure the hotel fulfills the local health codes but if you are looking for even a bit of comfort and a clean bed I would suggest you look elsewhere. We stayed long enough to use the phone to book another hotel (that we had used before) and then checked out. The staff said they had to bill us for three days, although the policy was stated on several websites as a one day penalty for late cancellation. However, after a complaint to the web service that we had booked through our money was totally refunded.\n",

We had a premier suite that was large and perfect for us. The living room was a perfect place to put our daughter in her\n",
      "pack n play and she slept late the next day because of the wonderful draperies blocking the light (until you open them-we had a great view of Commonwealth Ave.!!) Were able to close the french doors to our bedroom and watch a little tv without disturbing her. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated. Our room was in hues of blue and chocolate brown. The bathroom was restored, but still had beautiful old white marble and a seperate area to put on your makeup with good lighting. There is also a seperate wet bar area off of the living room that was a great space to keep our daughter supplies, food and bottles. The bed was very comfortable and my husband really enjoyed the wireless internet. The Eliot is also in a fabulous location and just a short walk to so many wonderful restaurants and shops. We were sad that we were only staying one night, but are delighted to have found a favorite hotel in Boston.\n",

      "Text: Overall, we had a good stay at the Greektown Casino Hotel. I was a little concerned about the check-in process and service due to other reviews I'd read, but these were no problem. The front desk made the process quick and easy, and was kind enough to assign us to rooms on the 29th floor, which offered spectacular views of Detroit and the surrounding area. The rooms themselves, although not big, were clean, modern, and nicely-appointed. The rates in the minibar were a lot less than what I've seen at other hotels in the Detroit area, which was a nice surprise. The bathroom design was a little inconvenient since there was no way to use the sink without lighting up the whole room and waking anyone who still might have been sleeping, but this wasn't a problem. \n",
      "There were a couple of issues with the hotel. First, the walls seem to be very thin. We didn't hear anything from the street our outside, but you could hear anything that happened in the hallway like it was right there in your room. Both rooms were awakened by noise in the hallway during our stay. Secondly, there was a disturbance in the room next to us that required hotel security to be called three different times. The good news was that they responded promptly each time and eventually removed the problem so that we could get back to sleep. The staff was very courteous about the incident and offered us free breakfasts and a discount on one of our rooms as well. Finally, the hotel sports bar turns into a nightclub on weekends. We came back from our event wanting to have a couple of drinks and watch the NCAA basketball games and were met with deafening music and a line to get in. However, the front desk was very helpful in finding a place just down the street that was quieter and had the games on.\n",
      "The main attraction to the hotel, and the reason I would stay there again, was its location. It's right in the Greektown neighborhood, which offers many different dining and entertainment options. It's connected to the casino by a secure indoor walkway, and is also adjacent to the People Mover, which is the best way I've found to get around downtown Detroit. It's also very easy to get to off the highway, which was nice both on the way in and the way out. In all, we enjoyed our stay and would most likely stay there again when we are in Detroit.\n",

      " Firstly the bar person ought to have been more attentive, as when my husband paid the barman, we left to go to our room, a couple of minutes later a waitress came running after us to say we hadnt paid our bill, which was very embarassing as we were talking to Richard at the time about my camera,so was rather rude - but she apologised quietly! It was rather unneccessary, as if we hadnt have paid the bill they should have charged our room.\n",
      "Secondly, the pre theatre dinner is a bit of a con, my husband quietly went off to book it as a surprise. It had a notice outside which said three courses for $30 each, when we sat down we were led to believe it was for anything on the menu before 7pm. It didnt say it was a set menu on the notice outside. The waiter came over and gave us this other menu which had gone up to $35 I did complain and he said this was a better choice- there wasnt really a choice, it was just a set meal. In the end we did order the rib eye which was what we thought we were going to get anyway, but worked out Very expensive, although it was lovely.\n",
      "The room itself was lovely and clean every day, apart from one day we came in about teatime and the bed was half made, as if she got interrupted and forgotten about it, but she came back and apologised. The bed was to die for, was so so comfortable, lovely to get into at night after an exhausting day sightseeing, hard to get out of in the morning, would reccommend going for the kingsize to anybody who is thinking of staying here.

The room was very clean and as indicated in previous reviews the furnishings were older, but everything was clean and the price was very very reasonable. The hotel was walking distance to everything, the subway was a block away. The staff was very friendly. Our room was on the 11th floor and we were towards the back so it was very quiet.

I emailed the hotel when I booked and asked for a room on a high floor and when we checked in we got an amazing room on the 51st floor!

The rooms yes are small but have everything you need and are clean and maintained well. I see from other reviews that it was noisy and yes it was but I have stayed in NYC before and that is part of the experience \"The City That Never Sleeps\". We were pretty exhausted with the sightseeing and jet lag so we slept through much of the noise anyway. We loved the complimentary pastries and the coffee in the morning as it was booked on a \"Room Only\" basis. The staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The only slight hitch was that we wanted rooms next door/on the same floor as we had out two teenage sons in a twin room. Unfortunately they were two floors down but I do put this down to our booking agent not requesting in time. Overall I would recommend The MAve is you are having a whistle stop tour of the Big Apple.\n",

      "Text: We stayed at the Westin Times Square on December 5, 2004 and had a very nice stay. With hotel prices so high for the holidays we didn't know if we would be able to stay in the city or not. We actually had reservations to stay in NJ, but canceled because we really wanted to be in Manhattan. We then made reservations at the Sheraton NY Hotel and Towers. We had stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan in the summer and were very pleased with the hotel, especially the friendly and helpful staff. So when we were able to get a room at either Sheraton for under $300 we decided to give the other one a try this time. But then I looked on Hotwire and saw a deal for a Times Square 4 Star hotel for less than $200. I did a lot of research on various sites and deducted that the hotel was probably the Westin at Times Square. I had never used Hotwire before but decided to give it a try, and boy am I glad I did. I purchased the hotel room for half the price of what I was going to pay for a comprable room. The Westin had mixed reviews on this site but I knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room so I'm glad I took the gamble. From check-in to check-out we did not have any complaints. The rooms weren't anything great but they were big enough for 2 adults and 2 preteens and most important - they were clean! The lady that check us in was very accommodating ( we were also able to check in early). I asked for 2 double beds and a non-smoking room and got it without hesitation. It was raining the next morning and we were given complimentary umbrellas to use for the rest of our stay. The bellhops were great. We stayed a Sunday night and the hotel was not very busy and the elevators were alway quick to take us where we needed .We stored our luggage after checking out and they were very helpful. If the price is right we would stay at the Westin again.\n",

The Union Square area, cable cars and the theatre district are a close walk. The hotel although quite old has been very well modernized and has walk in closets, safes etc. The two elevators although cosy are fun to ride. The best thing about the Hotel Carlton is the staff. They are all very friendly, courteous and knowledgeable respecting the city. It is just like speaking to a friend. They also multi task as Theo checked us in, provided tips on restaurants and driving in San Francisco and then played the keyboard to entertain us during the reception in the afternoon. The wine reception in the lobby between 5:30 and 6:00 pm was always a highlight with many of the guests in the hotel. All in all I would certainly recommend the Hotel Carlton to my friends and we will definitely stay there again when we travel back to San Francisco.

      "Text: We booked our New York vacation through Air MIles and after considering a couple of options decided on The New Yorker. We were not disappointed. This is a great hotel with small but comfortable rooms and great security. For $10 a night we upgraded to a room-with-a-view and it was worth every penny. We were in a corner room and out of one window had a view of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State building a few blocks away and Penn Station and Madison Square Garden just below. Out of the other window we had a partial view of the Hudson River and all the buildings north of the hotel. It seems like a small thing but there's something magical about being able to look out over the city at night. The lighting on the Empire State Building changes from time to time. It was green for St. Patrick's Day. The great thing about The New Yorker is that its within walking distance of many local attractions - Times Square, Broadway, St. Patrick's Cathedral, The Rockefeller Centre, MoMA, 5th Avenue. If you're ambitious you can even walk to the 9-11 Memorial (about 2 miles) and Central Park. There are many excellent restaurants in the area and it's an easy walk to local favourites like Grimaldi Pizza and Brooklyn Bagels. The Chinese restaurant just a block away, Chef Yu, was excellent. For a great lunch take the subway down to 369 Broome Street for a sub sandwich at Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich. One of the best meals all week was the Thai dinner we ate at Bangkok House, 360 West 46th, just a healthy walk from the hotel. The bed in our room was extremely comfortable and after walking miles every day we slept well. The housekeeping service was good - almost too good - as sheets and towels were changed even when they didn't need to be. The smallness of the room wasn't a factor most of the time, but the absence of a second chair meant that one of us had to sit on the bed while watching television (rare) or using the hotel's free internet. The free internet tended to be a little slow but we decided against the upgrade to premium internet for around $10 per day. The souvenir shop in the basement of the hotel was well stocked and reasonably priced. If you're considering taking a double-decker bus tour the consensus seemed to be that the Gray Line is more reliable than the City Sights competitor. We had pre-booked with City Sights and overall it was pretty good. However, one afternoon on the Uptown Tour, we hopped off at the Metropolitan Museum and never did hop back on. Every bus that came by was full with others who had hopped back on. There were about ten very tired and frustrated people still waiting when we decided to take a cab back to our hotel. Anyway, it was a fabulous week and having a great, comfortable hotel like The New Yorker as our home base had a lot to do with making this the vacation of a lifetime.\n",

We booked five nights and were contacted ahead of our stay by Mrs. Avellana, the \"Loyalty Ambassador\". She wanted to make sure that we have a pleasant stay, and we did. Gorgeous quiet and clean corner room with plenty of views. The staff service was outstanding, from checkin to departure. High notes for housekeeping and room service. We tried the restaurant several times, and the food and service were outstanding - try the smoked salmon flatbread for a breakfast change (the buffet is great, too). Location cannot be beaten. The only thing to improve: Wireless internet connection on floor 24 war bad to nonexistent, we were never able to connect to the Omni router (extremly weak signal) and used our wireless broadband card instead without any problems. vWe`ll be back soon!

In general, this hotel feels a lot more exclusive and fancy than the nearby Century Plaza (Hyatt Regency), which has much more of a tour-group and convention/conference feel to it.

The next morning, I found a big bowl with a cute goldfish (it is fed and cleaned by the staff).\n",
      "The room was a little bit on the small size but considering it is New York City it is reasonable (I have been in smaller rooms). It is elegantly decorated: sleek & modern with a retro feel to it (check the towel rack & sink in the bathroom, very Art Deco). There was a small walk-in closet (with mirrors, it reminded me of the Orient Express) and a sort of tall boy so there was plenty of room to put all our clothes and hide our suitcases in the \"closet\". \n",

There was a mini fridge and microwave as well as a coffee maker in the room. They have full Comcast digitial/HD cable TV, including HBO and HBO On Demand, nice for a chain hotel.\n",
      "There is no pool, so don't be mis-led by the website. There also aren't safe's in the room. There are plenty of cabs going uptown on 6th Ave and you'll never have a problem getting one. There is a Dunkin Donuts across the street (when you need a DD-fix in the morning).\n",

Palomar exceeded even our highest expectations. Our beloveds were permitted to be with us even in certain common areas, as we enjoyed the fabulous daily complimentary wine event, and we were assigned a suite in an area that was incredibly peaceful and non-scary for our little ones. . .Every area of the hotel was adorned with truly beautiful original artwork, which filled our senses without interfering with great relaxation. . .The kindness of the service was unmatched, in our experience, and cleanliness and freshness of the air and all environs were splendid. . .Our Concierge, on arrival, the brilliant young Philip, welcomed us so warmly that we felt like celebrities. . .This notwithstanding that all four of us (my husband, our 2 dogs, and I) are all mutts, and I am a funny-looking one, at that (:^)). . .We shall probably never enjoy such luxury and comfort again, at any price. . .and our memories of this stay are crystals of bliss. . .\n",

It's awesome, as was the suite itself. Very spacious, great fixtures and fittings, loads of space to play, work, relax - you could have a cocktail party in it.\n",

The bathroom and shower were lovely (though a little more water pressure would be cool), the lobby area a little oddly shaped and not really enough wardrobe space for a long stay, but this was a minor negative.\n",

I loved the look and location of this hotel according to the hotel's own website but there were one or two trip advisor reviews which left me with doubts. Nevertheless i decided to go ahead and book it for 4 nights.\n",
      "Delighted is all i can say, the entrance is small yes and a couple of sofa's if you wanted to wait around but reception staff was helpfull, friendly and so very polite. The lifts were ok, i don't feel we waited exceptionally long for one to arrive. The corridors are clean, neat and tidy. We were on floor 10 in an executive room which i believe is the same as a standard room just slightly bigger. \n",
      "No great view but i wasn't there to sit and look out of the window, there was a desk which i used as a dressing table, not a massive amount of space to put things in the bathroom but seriously we were there for 4 nights so there was enough room for what we needed. Just a shower, no bath but that was hot and good pressure.\n",
      "A safe in the wardrobe and about 20 hangers for the two of us, there were three drawers either side of the massive comfortable bed which again for 4 nights was perfectly adaquate for what we needed.\n",
      "The TV was large and had the usual channels, we managed to watch a film on ABC or something like that and you can pay extra for new films etc if you wanted too (not too sure how much they are). The mini bar is motion sensitive and that includes the things on top so i would recommend not touching any of it.\n",
      "The coffee/tea mmmmm well not too great to be honest, you have to make one cup at a time and there is only creamer and sweetners in the little packet so not too good but if black coffee if your thing then all good.\n",
      "You can have laundry, room service wake up calls etc etc the usual staff.\n",
      "The only small thing was one day after the room being cleaned they left a glass of water next to the bed and didn't empty one of the bins but that was it, you can have your towels and sheets changed as often as you like.\n",
      "Location - Could not do better, if you come out of the hotel and turn left within about a 1 minute stroll you are in the centre of time squares all the lights etc etc are there right in front of you. If you then turn left of right you are on broadway..\n",
      "If you turn right out of the hotel and walk two blocks you are on fifth ave, this is about a 3 - 4 minute stroll away. Central park is just passed Tiffany's and takes about a 15-20 minute stroll, empire state is about 10 -15 minute stroll with a pass by Macy's.\n",
      "Everthing is walking distance and if not for you the main bus terminal is 5 minute walk. Nearest subway is no more than 5 minutes walk.\n",
      "The Restaurant right next to the hotel you can charge to your room, we had breakfast there and it was about $45 for two of us for breakfast, juice, toast & Coffee. \n",
      "Overall the best decision i have made on a hotel. To give you an idea i stay in 5 star hotels generally but in a city a 4 star as you don't spend any time there, we were out by 9am and not back until 12am or a quick pop i for shower and change. A clean, friendly and lovely hotel, don't waste money on others for a fancy entrance with a man on the door as they are not worth it.\n",

The Sheraton is inexpensive, (I booked my nights for only $159 a night and about $200 less then some of the other swanky hotels that don't come close to offering the warmth, charm, and value I found here at this property!) For those with access to it the Concierge Lounge was excellent! A perfect place to unwind and get some work done with free refreshments and scrumptious appetizers. The location is perfect! Close to everything! The property is clean and warm and very cheerful. Every staff member that I encountered was authentically concerned about our comfort and enjoyment. They really want to make sure your experience is memorable. We took advantage of ordering some room service and were completely satisfied. The food arrived hot and tasty! In under 20 minutes!!! The hotel was immaculate and felt very cozy. The beds were a dream! (pun intended) The rooms were clean as a whistle and the bathroom was luxurious! \n",

They ask me to provide details whenever I encounter a truly exceptional experience that goes above and beyond the normal high standards Starwood sets for it's guests and you are without question the example they had in mind.  In the words of one of your most famous Govenors, \"I'll be back\"! \n",

The hotel is older but seemed to be kept up pretty well. Several nicks and scratches on the furniture but nothing terrible. The bathrooms were older but kept clean and updated the best that they could without a complete overhaul. Ask for a balcany room overlooking the pool for the best experience. If you don't ask, you probably won't get. Checked in early, around 12:30PM with no problem. On Saturday evening they set up a large movie screen by the pool and showed the movie \"Scooby Doo\". Several families were down at the pool sitting in lounge chairs enjoying the movie. It was kinda neat. The only thing is, is that if your room overlooked the pool, you could hear the movie with the sliding door open. But it was shown early enough in the evening that it wasn't an annoyance. The hotel circle area has many mid-range hotels to choose from and this one is pretty good size and probably my favorite right now. The only sad thing about the area is that, with all the hotels, there are few in any restaurants. I guess the hotels want you to eat at their hotels but haven't been lucky enough to eat at a good one there. All in all, not bad.\n",

Bathroom was well equipped with items needed. Robes were hanging in the bathroom.

Parking is very expensive, and you should really just not bring your car here anyway. If you must park, the garage across the street is $10 cheaper per day.\n",

It looked more kid-friendly than the hotels in Downtown San Diego. It really exceeded our expectations! Great water front location, great staff, clean rooms, nice decor, nice outdoor pool & patio area, and excellent food options in the area. There is a nice walkway and about a mile from the hotel, there is a nice park with two playgrounds (one for older kids and the other for toddlers). Also, in the Liberty Station area there is a restaurant called the Corvette Diner that we stumbled upon which is a 50's Diner where the staff dresses up and the women have beehive hairstyles and dance around. The girls loved it and so did we. The location of the hotel is convenient and close to Downtown and Coronado (which we loved). Highly recommend!!\n",

The only down side is there were large fans on the roof of the building next door so would not want to open the window. But we did not want it open anyways. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The only comment I would say against the room is it was way too cold but they did come and fix that for us.

She was very pleasant, suggesting that if we were driving to leave early- not something I would expect from a NYC \"boutique\" hotel. She even offered directions from New Jersey by train if we decided against taking the car! I must admit, this was a nice gesture. We arrived at City Club and were greeted by the bellman at the curb. The check in was quick and the staff offered assistance with dinner reservations and some suggestions on what was going on around town. We had already had made reservations, so declined their assistance. before we knew it we were upstairs in our room- which was wonderfully appointed, clean, and comfortable in size. The water pressure in the shower was amazing- the beds very comfortable and the service impressive. I felt like I was part of the family right away! Though our dinner reservations were not the best choice for us (maybe we should've taken the offer for help at check-in) our stay at City Club was great!

We were very lucky to have calm respectful people staying on either side of us, so we had no noise issues. Overall, most of the guests were very pleasant, not the Las Vegas type that come in the room and start a party at all hours. The only criticism I have are the restaurant prices. I'm willing to pay extra for the convenience of an in-house restaurant, but the Marriott was too overpriced. At least for dinner, we were able to walk two blocks down 46th street to Restaurant Row and had some great food and no wait!\n",

When we got in our room the crib we asked for was not there, no big deal, one call and less than five minutes later another guy was there with the crib. Again, another tip and don't get me wrong it is well deserved but most of the workers expected it and would even linger around until they recieved it. I know I sound cheap but I work for a living and every dollar I give to the valet for retrieving my car is taking away from what I can give my kids. I would suggest if you drive, park in the garage across the street. It is $8 a day, if u leave it is another $8 but you will be walking most of the time anyway. It certainly beats the $32 plus tax for the hotel valet.\n",

Room was very nice and clean and the bathroom updated neatly and also super clean too. If you are picky about cleanness, this is a nice hotel for you. I particularly enjoy all Courtyard and Marriott’s new white comfortable beds to rest every day. The only thing about our room was the layout was set up with the TV on the side of the bed, but you may request TV to be in front of bed. We wanted to keep our historic room and did not care much about TV, you really won’t have much time with everything there is to do there in DC including sightings. Just make sure you don't get a room overlooking the back alley if you prefer a nicer view - Just ask and you’ll shall be served! On the brightest side, there are lots of restaurants nearby, California Pizza for Italian, Morton's for a very special and romantic dinner (expensive to impress your partner =) but avoid Bertucci’s (not so good Italian food). As for breakfast, we recommend walking to Luna or for a fast thing just go to any Au Bon Pain -delicious!!! There is a CV Pharmacy right on the block if you need your Epson salts. Also, there are banks, apparel stores, boutiques, etc… We have stayed several times in DC and in Silver Springs (we recommend the Courtyard Downtown Silver Springs if you want to be far from the city life).

Staying in Philadelphia proper is too far away (due to traffic), and to get to UPenn graduation sites quickly, this is the hotel to choose. But that’s the only reason. During Graduation Week, the hotel doubles its prices. This is a complete rip-off. The rooms are smallish and while the beds are good to sleep in, the wood frames have sharp corners that are unfortunately very hard to avoid and painful to encounter. The closets are tiny and about four hangers are provided. The bathrooms: we had a King bed room, which had a large shower. The door only opened out, so that after leaving the shower, the bathroom floor flooded, with water dripping down the door. We changed to a room with a tub/shower, but those rooms do not have King beds. There is only one sink. Worst of all, the walls are thin as paper. The entertainment is constant. We were treated to the sounds of our neighbors talking on the phone, using the bathroom, having friends over till late at night, fighting, making up….and the only thing we were not treated to were the sounds of silence. Parking costs $39 per night. Our car is parked on the street outside of the hotel (yes, we are still here while I am writing this). We are told that there is Security watching the cars. Right. The housekeeping has been good on some days, and for the past two days has been lousy. I hate having to call up for missing items and then having to tip the person bringing those items, when they should have been in the room in the first place. Breakfast (at $40/pp) has been decent but not worth the price. Thank goodness our son graduated. This is not a hotel we would ever stay at again. Give me The Rittenhouse any day, even if it is not near the University (and if only they had had rooms available). Oh, and by the way, that IPad? Nothing but a useless gimmick.\n",

My problem occurred after checking out when I went to pick up my car at the recommended lot. Despite my reservation confirmation, which indicated a reduced parking fee of $30, and the website which says parking is $30, the garage charged me $40. They said my car was \"over-sized\". I went back to the hotel to question it and Alex at the desk said \"we have no control over what the garage does\". Although I might disagree with that notion, I did not argue, just asked that a manager call me the next day. It took a call to Holiday Inn Guest relations 2 days later before I received a call from the hotel management. I explained the situation, and received the same response that Alex gave: “we have no control over what the garage does\"; in addition, I was told that \"you would pay much more if we didn't negotiate a discounted rate\". No apology for any misunderstanding, no apology for the website being inaccurate. \n",

Got a great rate of only $89 through the Seattle visitors burueau site and their Super Saver rates....we had a waterfront room. The room was large and the bed was SO comfortable! High-end bedding. There was also a nice comfy chair and ottoman in the room. Everyone on the staff, from the bellmen to the valets to the front desk, were beyond courteous--very freindly and helpful. $25 was a lot to pay for parking but with the low hotel rate it worked out OK. Finally, the location can't be beat as it is within walking distance to the waterfront, the ferries, the football and baseball stadiums, and great areas to explore like Pioneer Square and the Public Market.\n",

First of all, there is breakfast every morning. Not granola, no no, you get hot courses, you get oatmeal, you get eggs, you get sausage, you get waffles, it's great! Then, Mon - Thurs, you get a cocktail hour of beer and wine and snacks, and mini-dinner in case you don't want to go out. But way more better than all of that is, dumb me, I forgot stuff in the room, and I called, and it was there, they found it, and they sent it to me! The staff is great, so helpful, and so un-uptight! Oh, and be sure to note that they have a shopping service, and it is free! All you pay for is the product you want. They leave the receipts on the table and the stuff in your fridge. If I was running a hotel business this is the way I would run it. I'd really like to hide this place so that I can stay there next year, but people that travel to Denver a lot should really take note! You get a suite (we had a one bedroom), you get breakfast, you get cocktails, you get free shopping, and you get an honest and responsive hotel staff. Wow. 5 stars from me.\n",

There is a wall of phones and I dialed the Radisson and they sent someone out with a van. We waited about 5 minutes and never saw the van so I called again and she said he would be right there and asked us where we were standing. 10 minutes later the van arrived. Loaded the luggage and headed to the hotel. By the way, it is a free shuttle. The hotel is literally right across the street from the main entrance to the airport, so it is about THE closest you can get. Our room was not ready when we arrived at noon, so they kept our bags for us and we walked a few blocks down to a restaurant called Sharps, which was a bbq style restaurant. It was delicious. We called the hotel and at about 1:30 our room was ready. We booked a king room. In addition to the bed, there was a desk and small sitting area and the bathroom was pretty big. Everything was super clean. I loved the Sleep Number bed. The wi-fi was free in our room. The hotel was about 3 blocks from the Light Rail and we walked there and purchased rail tickets downtown, which was about a 40 minute ride. When we came back, we bought drinks in the lobby, which I just loved. It was very nice with couches and a fireplace and you just felt like you were at a friend's house having a drink. The bar tender poured a VERY good vodka and cranberry and we sat there and chilled out and watched TV for a while before heading up to bed. We had breakfast coupons and in the morning we headed down to breakfast, which was good.Even though there were a ton of people there for cruises, we didn't have to wait for a table. \n",

Hotel was very crowded but the floors were relatively quiet at night and even during the daytime. Location is central to convention center and several good local places to eat (I recommend Thai Tanic) and safe to walk at night. The hotel restaurant, 14k, has a good menu and wonderful patio seating for people watching. Make sure to ask your waiter for the \"Bar Bites\" and Dessert menus though, or you might not see them. If you get the chance to try to the Lobster Bisque or pretzel bread, go for it! Absolutely wonderful!\n",
      "What made this hotel very special to us and ensured our return was the staff, starting with the Guest Services Coordinator Innocent Chesang (yes that's his name :) He was outstanding! The man knows everything there is to know about DC including where to purchase the best cigars!! Stay at this hotel for no other reason than Innocent; he takes away all anxiety of navigating the city. Another member of the staff was a wait staff person named Marybel; another treasure. She kept us entertained with her wonderful way with the patrons and the service was impeccable. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the young man who checked us in, and also engaged us in conversation about the food show we were attending; very pleasant and he too went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. If I had to say anything bad about the hotel it would be that the elevators (there are several and not much of a wait ever) are very small. We travel alot with business and if that's the worst I can come up with then it's a WINNER!!\n",

      "Text: As an underage traveler, I realized I made a mistake going to SD due to the fact that Gaslamp caters to those 21+. It was a rainy weekend so I did not get to enjoy the outside area, and to top it off I got into a car accident during my stay. The most comforting thing about my trip was the hotel. It was very warm, welcoming, and I spent most of my weekend indoors, which was really the highlight of the trip. The best part of my stay would probably be Joe, the concierge. We felt that he genuinely cared about our stay and wanted us to have a good time despite what happened. If not for Joe, our trip would have been a total bust. I usually don't take time out to write reviews, but I feel that he deserves recognition for his personalized service and is the primary reason we will choose to stay at this hotel when we return. Thank You Joe for renewing our trip and for giving us a reason to come back.\n",

I walked in and checked in; no one asked if I needed help with luggage - and I did. I got a cart and did it myself which wasn't difficult but was pretty startling for a Hilton.

Credit cards needed to be used the old fashion way and there sound system reverted to playing Christmas music even though it was the end of January. What can you do. Technology.

We enjoyed the spa, steam bath, relaxation rooms and the oil scented couples bath, all very relaxing and suprisingly affordable. The swimming pool and hot tub area was well maintained and clean with an unfortunate view of ships loading at the Dole warehouse. Food in the resturant downstairs was actually good the 3 times we ate there. I did find the Gift shop to be very expensive, paying nearly $8 for a toothbrush.

Costs will mount up pretty quickly if you are staying for a long time but we were only there for a day and a half and one night. Hotel service was poor in the bar but the bell boys were good and looked after our luggage all day after we checked out. No problems there. When we were staying the (small) swimming pool was freezing to the point of being useless - hopefully that's fixed now and it's not meant to be unheated.

I had to call - they instruct you to go on-line and through a series of \"clicks\" request a copy of your statement - says it can take up to 48 hours. Normally, I would not leave without a bill.

He doesnt make noise, and I assume is respectful to guests, but seems to be home all day, and smokes like a chimney. Thus the hall way does smell of smoke as soon as you step out the lift.\n",

      "We chose this hotel partly because it was connected to the people mover. Just walk through the casino and you're at the people mover. Fifty cents for a ride, which we used to go to Joe Louis Arena. Very crowded after the game.\n",
      "From the parking garage you can get to the hotel and the skywalk to the casino. Had to use your room key to get to the floors with rooms on them, so that added a bit of comfort. The room was nice. Beds were comfortable, room extremely clean, had a work station (of course I believe it was 9.99 for WIFI), snack bar, flat screen TV on wall, and plenty of room. The hotel was also extremely quiet. Thought that it would be loud and full of less than splendid people since it was a casino, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "Not much of a gambler, casino seemed nice though. Seemed to be big too. Only thing I didn't like was it seemed like more than half the slots were either penny or 2 cents. Everywhere you looked, to no surprise, there were more penny machines.\n",
      "Ate lunch at the buffet. It wasn't wonderful, but it also wasn't horrible. It was a cold rainy day so we didn't want to go looking outside for a place to eat, so we decided on this. If you're in the casino, hungry, and don't want to leave I'd go for the 9.99 lunch buffet, but if you don't mind leaving the casino I would.\n",
      "Ate a late night burger at Shotz Bar in the lobby. Once again, didn't feel like dealing with the rain and cold at 10PM and it was better than I thought it would be. Bar type food, but the burgers were awesome and wasn't that expensive for being a bar in a hotel lobby. 2 burgers, 1 beer, 2 jack and cokes were $35. Not bad for a hotel bar.\n",
      "I would definately recommend this place beacuse of its convenience, value, and comfort. Thinking about coming back for a Tigers or Lions game, and this will be the place I stay.\n",

After our room service meal was delivered, we had to call back for them to deliver cream for the coffee and silverware! Needless to say by the time they came back, the rest of the meal was cold. They only had one person bartending and waitressing in the afternoon. No fault to this lonely employee who was trying to serve everyone to the best of their ability, but was not able to provide prompt service. Aside from the service, there was mold growing on the bathtub tiles. I was interested to see if they would clean it the next day (which they did not). The maid service also knocked on the door and asked if we we \"needed anything\". I thought daily cleaning was the norm for Marriott and it was not necessary to request this service. The computer area for business and customer use was at the junction of two hallways with alot of noise and traffic. The computer was also facing the center of the room making everything on the screen visible to the other people standing around.

The staff was more than accomodating in helping me arrange a semi-private dinner at the restaurant on the property. I was very impressed with all of their efforts. The hotel is downtown - so it's very close and within walking distance to the Moscone Convention center and many other attractions and shopping areas. My one and only issue is that there is no free internet access (about $15 per day).

Best bet is to be dropped off or find another way here and forget the car. \n",

Our room was really nice. We stayed there three years ago, and I could tell that our room had been updated since then. I think the furniture was the same, but it appeared to have new carpet and the bathroom vanity area appeared newer. It was very clean too. Wore white socks around the room the first night and couldn't see anything on the bottoms. The tub/toilet area of the bathroom is not fancy. Just a simple tub and toilet. If you are expecting glass shower surrounds and seperate tub and shower area, you might want to look elsewhere. Our room was on the ground floor of a two-storied building and was SUPER quiet. We could only hear our neighbors when they were coming in their door from the outside. We could hear our upstairs neighbors walking around occassionally, but overall...probably one of the quietest we have ever stayed in. Room was a great size for our family of 5. Our littlest slept on a toddler cot we brought from home. We requested a microwave and with that and the refrigerator, we were able to make several light meals in our room.\n",

      "Text: We just returned from our first time staying at this hotel. We booked on Priceline and (I think) we got a really good deal. I was hoping to find a decent hotel that we could afford on a Saturday night, that was in a good downtown location. I couldn't have asked for more. After hearing so much about the Metro and how easy it is to use and the convenience, we figured we'd give it a try. And how perfect, this hotel is built on top of a Metro station. Not all stations have parking though, and since it costs $33/day to park at the hotel, we chose a nearby station that did offer free parking on weekends. We left the car there overnight Saturday to Sunday with no problems. And free! We arrived at the hotel around 1pm and inquired about check in. They said they don't start that until 4pm. It wasn't a problem, we just continued with our sightseeing and riding the Metro. We came back to the hotel around 4:30 and checked in with no problem. We had a room with two double beds overlooking the roads and also a nice view of the harbor. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. I personally loved the blackout shades they had on the windows. This is so important when trying to sleep in when I'm on vacation and not all hotels have them! A definite plus in my book. We didn't choose to eat at the restaurant at the hotel, because of hearing how pricey it is, but at least you have it as an option. We did use the hotel pool for a short period of time (it was pretty crowded) but a nice little refreshment after walking all day. Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hotel downtown so you don't have to drive everywhere, this is your place. It has character and may need some updating (which I guess they are working on based on the construction we saw going on), but it met all of our needs. If you are someone who needs complete peace and quiet during your stay, this might not be for you. You can definitely hear the trains going in and out. And from what I can see on their website, I think I saved almost half of a normal night's stay by booking through Priceline.\n",

And even though the living room faced the interior courtyard, never heard a single sound from the outside! A first-rate front desk that has a can-do attitude with a smile. Only downside is the location is odd and not an area you want to explore on foot but it's easy to reach any area in Boston/Cambridge. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you Doubletree!\n",

We had a great room on the fifth floor overlooking the park, and in our case the Thanksgiving Day parade! Floor to ceiling windows really made a difference and our guests (you were allowed up to ten) truly enjoyed the experience. We had a Keurig in the room and complimentary waters. We also had the use of a kitchen in an adjacent room. Nightly turn downs with chocolates, slippers, and robes reminded you that it was a five star experience. Room service was fantastic and the food unforgettable! You will be spending top dollar to get a parade view room anyway-- why not book the best? (this was our fourth parade view room)\n",

The staff was unbelievably helpful and the location was perfect (right near Millennium Park, multiple L train lines, great shopping and restaurants, and walkable to many major attractions). We loved the lobby and overall decor of the hotel. It was really classic and elegant but not over the top. The restaurant seemed very busy though we didn't eat there - I would imagine it's quite good given the popularity. The hotel is dog friendly and it was such a treat seeing our furry friends in the elevator and lobby. They do a daily wine happy hour from 5-6pm which was a nice touch and great way to unwind after a long day or have a pre-evening drink in the comfortable lobby. I would definitely return and absolutely recommend this wonderful gem of a hotel! We got a great deal via SniqueAway but I think it's relatively affordable even without a discount.\n",

The staff was very helpful & accommodating even when we asked to change rooms. The first room, though it was removed from the elevators, received reverberating elevator noise. Be aware...Sheraton parking is expensive at $45 a night. We thought we would save $$ by parking in the City Centre garage lot directly across the street. The sign appeared to state $16 for overnight/all day parking. But, the charge was $49! The parking attendant said it was a change & written in the fine print on the sign.

If you know NY hotels you know nothing comes for free however, here you do get those little extras which makes all the difference. We booked here at the last minute and all that was left was a petite room. We were a bit apprehensive about this as reviews had said it was just big enough for 1 person but when we got there it was just right for the 2 of us. Admittedly it wasn't large but it was so comfortable and cosy and more importantly extremely clean. There were books in the room, bottled water, and all the other usuals plus if you fancy staying in there are DVDs to borrow and play on your DVD player. Another thing rare for NY is the fact that breakfast is served and more to the point it is actually quite good. It is served overlooking Madison Ave and you are sat in large leather chairs with a selection of papers and books should you want them.\n",

Nonetheless, I continued to spend hours researching other hotels before finally deciding on Palomar. The reviews were great and now, having just returned from there today, I can definitely concur. The staff is inviting and accomodating, they will recommend restaurants, make reservations for you, print out directions, etc. The complimentary popsicles and ice water are a nice touch on a hot day. The complimentary wine reception in the lobby from 5-6 each evening was always bustling. Our room was enormous - an \"executive king\" - must have been 550 sq. feet with an entire wall of floor to ceiling windows. The restaurant was pricey for breakfast, I thought. We did have calamari there one night and it was excellent The bartender, Joe, was wonderful. Dupont CIrcle and the Metro are just up the street. Many have said, but the Metro is the best way to get around - fast, clean and safe. We had lunch at Front Page on New Hampshire St. off Dupone Circle, very good, dinner at James Hobans across the street, just ok. Crepes place across the street was great. A 20-30 minute walk down P street to Georgetown - and it's a great walk by historic homes. We had dinner at Agraria on the waterfront in Georgetown and it was fantastic!\n",

You have the option of either a bay view, or marina view. We opted for the bay view, and enjoyed watching the ships move about. Realize that you'll be looking over a parking lot, so a second floor room is best. By the way, it's a great walking area since the entire length of the shore line is a park. The staff at the hotel was excellent, all very helpful and attentive. And the breakfast is not the standard continental one that most hotels offer. It consistently offered scrambled eggs, fried potatos, fresh fruit, and often pancakes. Plus, you look out at the beautiful boats in the marina as you eat. A lovely place!\n",

Also, the Bart trains are not far; if you don't mind walking 4 blocks and don't have a ton of luggage, I recommend using Bart to get to the Rex from the airport.\n",

Nice size bathroom too. Somehow, I lucked out and had a window air conditioner, but I am not sure if all rooms have this.\n",

Love the changing exterior lights at night. Lobby is very cool, check out the fireplace! Check-in was easy. Room cost reasonable. There is a charge for parking, of course, normal for any downtown hotel anywhere, but very convenient and reasonable. Rooms were roomy and beautifully done. Requests for rollaway and microwave were accommodated quickly. Wonderful pool area, great view while swimming. Didn't actually try the spa but I assume the rating below includes the pool area, from what we could see of the actual spa I have no doubt that it would be as good as the rest of the experience. Breakfast buffet was amazing, rivals the best anywhere. Not a single negative. We had three rooms with different family members and all felt the same. Our daughter and her husband had room service for breakfast and again, quick, delicious, and fun. Be aware that they mention airport shuttle, but actually what they have is an agreement with third party providers, not a bad arrangement but we did have one cab driver who tried to take advantage. Got out, called the Omni, and another was sent immediately. Needed a taxi at one point, loved the bellman's traditional taxi whistle, very effective.

I want to commend several of them; namely Katlyn who always greeted us with a smile, Tim who was both polite and professional, Madison who seemed to know more about San Antonio than I think anyone else on the property and then Ronnie who was introduced to us by Madison as her manager and I have to say this young man is a true professional. He was engaging, professional and personable. He took time to learn about us and the nature of our trip and sought out ways to make it better than it started. If this is the person who is training your team I commend his efforts, job well done.

      "Text: Because my partner and I were relocating to New York City, we thought this place sounded perfect for the two weeks we would need to find an apartment. We were hoping to find something that would feel more like a home than a hotel and Inn New York City was just perfect for us!\n",
      "The Inn is basically a brownstone on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The owners see to it that you are well taken care of, but do not interfere when they are not needed, so you really feel like you have your own apartment in the city, and they even do your laundry upon request.\n",
      "We ended up staying in the Opera Suite on the main floor as it was the only one available for the entire 2 weeks we would need. We were very pleased with the arrangement of the suite. There were no stairs to climb (other than the steps outside), which was helpful for us at the time. Inside the suite we had a lovely firm - and very comfortable - queen sized bed facing the fireplace. We only used the fireplace one night, but Ruth, one of the two owners, needs to come and light a firelog due to too many mishaps of guests in the past, but it was lovely all the same. You do need to be aware, however, that the owner needs to be notified in the afternoon if you would like a fire in the evening. \n",
      "We also really loved having a kitchen with everything you could ever need to cook and we enjoyed preparing some of our own meals from time to time. They also leave fresh sweets, fruits, and flowers every afternoon along with some basics such as juice, milk, and quiche in the fridge.\n",
      "Our suite also had a baby grand piano in it along with many piano books and opera magazines - great for the classical music lover!\n",
      "The only downside for me is that one night I fell terribly ill with food poisoning and was not able to get a hold of anyone in the inn as it was the middle of the night. There was an emergency contact number for the inn by the phone, but nobody answered. As we were new to the city, we were hoping they could put us in touch with an emergency doctor. I did eventually find a house doctor online who was able to come to the inn the following morning - which was a lifesaver!\n",
      "Overall we were very satisfied with our stay here as it was greatly helpful in our transition of moving to the city. I would highly recommend it for anyone visiting the city looking for something more personable than a hotel.\n",

You will enjoy the rooftop terrace which is ideal for group events. We were greeted with complimentary champagne in late afternoon and each time we have stayed in a different room or suite, all of them spacious, well-maintained, all of the amenities you would expect in a four star hotel, and, on the west side, you can enjoy a view of the Mississippi River lazily flowing by, a scene in late afternoon with a beautiful sunset in the background takes you back a century. General Manager Karl Friedrich and his excellent staff make each guest feel welcome, and the hotel overall has achieved the highest standards in our judgment, and we have been a few places. Paulette's Restaurant is the Inn's four-star restaurant that consistently earns its \"Most Romantic\" and \"Best Continental\" designation, clearly a Memphis favorite made even more memorable by our waitress, Donna, who knows the menus by heart and guided us to some delicious grouper and salmon dishes with lobster bisque, homemade raspberry sorbet (\"they make it every three hours!\") and a french crepe featuring locally grown plums (\" grown on a nearly farm on Highway 51\"). The cosy, welcoming atmosphere of the Inn and its superb restaurant and staff that aims to please at every turn will amaze you and keep you coming back. We have found our little escape!\n",

I guess it's a good way for the hotel to build its marketing data base.\n",
      "While the public area decor is funky (eg; art works such as a sculpture of little men abseiling down the wall of the lobby) our room was slightly minimalist with a bed, table/desk and desk chair but no other chair and no tea/coffee making facilities. It did however have a minibar and you are given the key to this - this explained why the inside of the cabinet was quite dusty - the room maid does not have a key to the minibar cabinet.\n",
      "The evening wine-tastings, which are free, were quite popular with all the guests and a nice touch which we greatly appreciated. The reception staff were very helpful in arranging a limousine hire for us as well as a river cruise and Talisa in particular was extremely helpful in assisting us to sort out some difficulties we were experiencing with our Westpac Bank by scanning and email our passports to the bank for us.\n",

We were in Boston for something else and having a great time window shopping in all the designer stores and while having a drink in the hotel bar (a great place with a huge drinks menu and great food) when we decided we didn't want to go home. I asked about the rate and was told $329. When I asked if they could do any better, I was immediately given a rate of $249. Our room was on the 25th floor and was a corner room. We had amazing city views and two entire walls were windows. My only issue with this hotel was with the tv of all things. The cabinet holding it was in front of one of the windows and because of this I guess, it was not very tall. This made the tv at a weird low angle. Even though it was a flat screen, the picture was not very good. And surprisingly, there is no free tv. Everything is pay per view, and then not many choices. I thought this was odd since I can't remember staying hotel that didn't offer free tv channels. The bathroom was small, but it was very clean and since it was only one night it was fine. Our bed was a king size and was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The pillows were great and normally I can't sleep on hotel pillows. \n",

Having decided \"what the hell, I'm a tourist, so don't be ashamed to do the touristy stuff\", I put my trust in the Tripadvisor reviews which rate this hotel so highly and was not disappointed in the slightest. I booked the \"A Discovery Awaits\" package which included Valet Parking, breakfast at the Blue Mermaid Chowder House, and Cable Car/Bus/Tram passes. I upgraded our room in advance to a \"King Bay View\" room on the grounds that several reviews complained the rooms were on the small size. So I can't comment on the standard room - however I can highly recommend this kind of room, although it is pricey. Be aware that the view is partial and certainly not uninterrupted. However the room is large, spotlessly clean and full of quirky touches, colours and furniture. Staff were absolutely delightful, made us feel so welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble. Breakfast was fine - of course you can get better, but it was included in our rate and was well cooked, with friendly service. Parking is expensive if not included in your rate. The Powell/Hyde cable car turnaround really is close - in fact it was under our window, less than a two minute walk from the front of the hotel.\n",

The suites are divided into two areas (sleeping & lounge) separated by the bathroom. They have two flat screen TVs, settee, armchair, coffee table, work desk, free internet (wifi & wire), table lamp, ergonomic chair (very few hotels have these and it really helps when you're working). There is also a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board. The beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet. The bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror, good water pressure, and plenty of towels. \n",

The swimming pool is out the front of the hotel, it is a good size and has a jacuzzi. It overlooks the carpark, but you're not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is.

      "Hotel bus - a real plus. The hotel run a free shuttle bus service to anywhere within a 5 mile radius. They take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when you're ready to be collected. It's like having a personal chauffeur. They will drop / collect you at restaurants, shops (Memorial Mall), wherever within the radius. \n",
      "Staff - you can stay in the best hotel in the world but if the staff are haphazard or surly then your stay is marred or even ruined. I've travelled all over the world and in an average year, spend 150-180 nights in hotels. I can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams I've ever encountered. I won't name them all because I'm bound to miss someone, but when you have Nancy or La-La starting to worry about whether you've returned to the hotel at your regular time, or when the breakfast team give you a hug, then you know that the team really do care. They all take a great pride in their work, in looking after their guests, and they really do work as a team. Hilton - take note, your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team.\n",
      "Downsides - of course there are some:\n",
      "- Air conditioning units can be a bit noisy and draughty. They are next to the bed, but if they were at the other end of the room it would be better.\n",
      "- Makeup mirror - would be good to have a magnifying mirror, but it's not a big deal.\n",
      "- Room safe - plenty of space to put one, so would be good to have.\n",
      "- In-room coffee facilities are good for coffee - but not good for tea. Tea needs boiling water and it shouldn't be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste (you can tell I'm from the UK). An in-room kettle would be great.

      "Text: Okay, if you're going to be near Times Square which is good because of your proximity to both sides of town and both train stations, why not be in one of the most famous hotels in the world? It's worth it and you won't find many rooms like this in NYC. The beds are extremely warm and cozy, the art on the walls all tell tales of the history of the hotel from illustrations depicting the originators of The Atlantic Monthly to hand-written poetry of Dorothy Parker to letters to his editor by Truman Capote. The bathrooms are deep, the water warm, it really has everything you need including vintage old NYC furniture that is comfortable and in unbelievably good condition. And to think you are only a few floors above The Round Table... to be so close to a round surface with simple wooden legs that at one time hosted the liveliest, most important and humorous ongoing literary dialogues in the world. If you have a large enough group, you can actually reserve that table! Positively remarkable considering this piece of furniture should be stored in The Smithsonian. \n",
      "One drawback: some of the help. There are the nice men and women who are the waiters and the maids. We decided some of the waiters were straight out of New Yorker cartoons. And you can't help but get the feeling most of the help has been there since 1934 and still get a kick out of each other and their job. They're not the problem. \n",
      "It's some of the unpleasant and/or inefficient characters at the Front Desk. Though one or two were friendly and helpful, most were snobby and seemed put upon -- as though they had better things to do. And while the day concierge was sweet as all get out, he did not, as promised, provide me with a special store he and I had a lengthy conversation about. \n",
      "A slightly less inocuous example of poor behavior occured when I explained to the current Front Desk man that the man from the previous evening promised me a great rate for the following night *which he truly had. The man at the Front Desk smirked, barely looked me in the eye, and said he didn't know why that happened, that gentleman shouldn't have promised me that and he couldn't help me. Then he went about his business as I stood there. At the moment, if I hadn't liked others in the hotel as much and the room, I would have asked he move my stuff out and I get my money back. His manner was postively rude and discourteous. Perhaps he was correct, his colleague should have made no such promises, and perhaps I should have taken up his colleague's offer when he put it out there, but this charming man could have handled it without being so disgustingly unpleasant. \n",
      "I was further underwhelmed when I discovered I had lost a piece of jewelry. Once having discovered the loss on my way to another location, I phoned the Front Desk to explain what I had missing. But after that call, no one got back to me, and it was a family heirloom. I phoned the hotel to find out about the follow up and had many short conversations that seemed perfunctory with the front desk pleading they check again with Security. But neither they nor their Security Officer has bothered to phone me to this day. Honestly, even if it were to simply say, \"Miss, we've interviewed everyone, there's nothing we can do. We are so sorry,\" I would have been disappointed but felt the proper attention had been paid. Instead I am left angry and disenchanted. \n",
      "Granted I was there during the holidays and no one wants to work during that time, but as long as they're there and I'm there and we are all there together, I think they could have bent over backwards or sideways or bent their bodies upwards to look me in the eyes, so as to make my stay more pleasant and prevent such a complex review. \n",
      "These to me though are luxurious problems. It's not like I would call downstairs, ask for tea and it wouldn't arrive within ten minutes (although everything cost a buttload -- watch out for the costs. One one minute phone call to LA cost me ten dollars). There were many moments of excellent hospitality. And regardless of my specific disparaging remarks, The Algonquin is a charming, beautiful, comfortable hotel in a good location. Just bring a little attitude in your bag so when necessary, you can throw it back to Mr. Charming Pants at the Front Desk. Dorothy Parker would expect no less. \n",
      "p.s. If you make ressies on line, be careful you are not quoted one rate for one evening and another rate for another evening. I got stung that way and insisted, prior to checking in, it be changed at once. They did so, which was helpful, but keep your eye on the ball. I'm positive this is common practice amongst many hotels but it's an odd practice and the ethics of which I question.\n",

      "Text: The Beacon Hotel is a great boutique hotel that we found to be family friendly. Our stay entailed staying a Friday and Saturday and checking out Sunday at noon. My husband had some business he was conducting during Friday & Saturday very near to the hotel; hence, the reason we stayed at this location and not closer to the main attractions of D.C. Additionally, the bedbug registry was checked there were NO reports associated with this hotel so we chose to stay at the Beacon. \n",
      "Having bedbug phobia and upon arrival, my husband & I took apart the beds to check for bedbugs. We saw no signs anywhere around the mattresses or headboards (relief!). The mattresses all seemed new and had those bedbug covers on them. I checked the drawers and all around the place and it looked ok so we stayed. One night my 5 yr son slept only in PJ pants and no shirt and had no bites in the morning upon close inspection. Granted, I nor my family have never had a bedbug encounter, but I've just been reading so much about it I feel like I could accurately identify bites. So it freaks me out .....badly! \n",
      "So anyways, we had reserved adjoining rooms, one room had two double beds, a sleeper couch and a kitchenette and the other was just their standard room with a King sized bed. The exact term would be Corporate Quarters Double Double room which had the kitchenette and our room was a King Deluxe room. The Double was definitely large and was where our boys 5 yrs, 3 yrs and 9 months slept. My neighbor's sister babysat our children at night as we had plans with friends for dinner during the evenings so it was necessary to make sure there was ample room for 3 energetic boys. The kitchenette, sink, microwave, etc sure came in handy. We had bought snacks such as microwavable popcorn and frozen pizzas for them while they watched a TV show with the sitter. The bathroom was very large and there was lots of closet space. Overall the room was clean. I had requested a crib for our baby and a pac-n-play was brought to us quickly up room arrival. I would suggest requesting a high chair from the restaurant as there are none in the room. One was brought for us to use during our stay. \n",
      "The king room that adjoined the double room was very small, which was fine for us to sleep in, keep our clothes in and have some privacy. We were very grateful that we purchased the double and not another King for our boys. It was probably not the biggest room I've stayed in but it was ok for us. If you are looking for luxury and plan to spend much time in your room, I'd suggest upgrading to a larger room. \n",
      "Overall, we were very pleased with the service and our stay. It was quiet and we barely heard other patrons or street noise so that was lovely! We did not eat in the hotel so I can not rate the food however, we had heard through friends that the brunch is very good. \n",
      "Lastly, upon writing this a week after our stay, we are 100% sure that we had NO bedbug encounters and have not brought any home, although we did take all the necessary precautions to not bring them into our home. I would recommend staying here.\n",

      "The desk staff were excellent (especially Lisa!) The rooms were always cleaned well and promptly by happy, friendly staff. The rooms thmselves were well appointed and as previously mentioned huge by New York standards. The bed was wonderfully comfortable which is important after hours of pounding the pavement sightseeing and shopping. Hmmmmmmmmmm shopping... one of my favorite things to do.. especially in New York... As other reviewers have mentioned.. the location of the hotel is fabulous for all the major shops..Dont forget when you go to Maceys to take your passport with you and go to the customer service desk and get a discount shoppers card.. it will give you 10% off the majority of your purchases... even things that are on sale are included. Manhattan is great for clothing and shoes because there is no sales tax on an item if it is under $110.. so what you see on the tag is what you pay.. unlike other American states.\n",
      "In a nutshell i wont be staying anywhere else next time we are in New York... I have travelled there many times and have finally found a place that ticks all the boxes.. clean, well located, well appointed, reasonably priced (no mean feat in NYC!) free internet and free breakfast with friendly staff to wrap up the parcel!\n",

      "Text: We stayed two nights over Labor Day weekend. . . overall, it is a very nice family hotel in a good location near 14th street (clean, well-lit & travelled, easy to get in and out). It is a treck to the metro station (about 3 long blocks), so if your children are younger than 6-7 I would probably choose something with a closer stop. Otherwise, we parked our car & forgot it for 2 days. . . public transport was very efficient and the hotel is close enough to the White House to walk there. A cab to Georgetown for dinner was less than $10. The breakfast was plentiful (both hot & cold items) & delicious - much appreciated by the mother of 3 hungry kids. The staff was very pleasant & the children loved our maid's creative handiwork with their stuffed animals/bedspreads. The beds were comfortable, pillows & linens were good quality. After walking/sightseeing all day, it was nice to come home to a large suite that was big enough for 3 adults & 3 children. The lobby area was very nice also- I don't think it needs updating as some other reviewers noted. We enjoyed our stay & would recommend to both families or business travellers. My only complaint would be the cost of valet parking, but I did see a public parking garage across the street that might be less expensive.\n",

In total, we had three rooms but we all came in one vehicle and we were only charged for one vehicle. No issues with billing, check in and check out was a breeze (much appreciated since my husband and I were traveling with all teenagers). It was a flawlessly easy break with the kids thanks to the Hilton.

      "Our window gave us a spectacular view of the air conditioning unit over the first floor, but we hadn't asked for a room with a view. A room on any higher floor would get a lovely view of the river and the many bridges and impressive skyline. We also forgot to ask for a non smoking room and so ours smelled strongly of smoke just inside the door. I'm sure they would have moved us if we had asked, the lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. We didn't try room service or either of their restaurants. We did go to the Tastings, which is on their property, to get a picnic for our room. Also within easy walking distance along the river is The Chart House, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and River City Brewing Company. There is a pool, which seemed clean and pleasant with a couple of comfy hammocks off to the side. There is also a fitness center available, but we stuck with the hammocks. \n",

The Raffaello hotel is in a great location. A little off a side street so all the main traffic isn't in front of the hotel. All you have to do is walk a block and you are in front of the John Hancock Center and a big intersection of Michigan Avenue. We arrived early around 12:00pm ish and nothing was ready as I did request a higher floor. So the front desk staff was amazing and held our bags for us as we walked around for a few hours. We came back around 3 and our room still wasn't going to be available until 4:30-5:00. However, they did say they had a handicap room available immediately on lower floor. To be honest I was exhausted and so I said we would take it. GREAT IDEA! Our room had plenty of extra space to move around in. My dad fell asleep as soon as he laid down on the bed! I took a nap too. The beds are very comfy with the nice thick but soft pillows. Something I noticed was the fan/air conditioning. It was on my side of the room and I turned it up full blast and it hardly made any noise at all! This was a huge plus for me.There were plenty of outlets for me to charge up all my electronics after the flight and before the meet. I enjoyed playing with the iHome and my iPod touch. :) The bathroom was large! I don't know if it is like that in all the rooms or just because we had a handicap room. The shower was my absolute favorite. It is a rainfall shower head but it still had plenty of pressure unlike others I have experienced. \n",

The man I spoke to said he switched us to a room with 2 queens, but no room for a rollaway. This would work since our 3 yr. old usually ends up in our bed anyway, so we would just start that way, and our 6 and 9 yr old boys could share a bed. \n",

Unfortunetely the room change wasn't really made and they still had us in one queen. Victoria at the desk was very very helpful. After checking a couple of rooms for us, we checked into a roof top room that are normally not available in the summer because of their bar. But the winter they were perfect, with a view of the river and empire state building! We ended up with a king and a rollaway bed.

      "Text: We had a wonderful week in San Francisco and really enjoyed the Handlery. I can't imagine a more perfect location and it's really a nice place. We had a club room and had hoped to get a balcony but they weren't available when we got there. However, our room did have a giant sliding glass door that we really enjoyed. We appreciated the coffee maker and little fridge, too--we bought fruit at the Ferry Building farmer's market and we kept it cooled. We didn't use the robes or the shoeshine machine but they were a nice touch. Also, they had a scale in the bathroom--guess it's to keep us honest with all the wonderful food in the city. \n",
      "As I said, there were just a couple things that keep me from giving the Handlery a 5. We had a few issues with the staff--all of whom were very friendly but generally, not that helpful. First, I had done a lot of research planning our trip and emailing different hotels to see about getting a smoking room. The Handlery was one of the few places that indicated that it was likely--no promises--but likely. As suggested, we emailed a day ahead reminding them of the request. When we arrived we asked again and the clerk said, nope, none available. It hadn't been promised but it sure didn't seem like they made any attempt either. We were there a little early and I’d have felt better if he had at least been willing to check to see if a smoking room might be cleaned and readied later—anything—if he’d just acted like he cared at all, but it was just “no”. We might well have ended up choosing the Handlery anyway but a lot of the decision was made because they indicated we could probably get the smoking room and after being there I’m guessing that they have very few available. *Note--on the positive side, smoking was allowed at the pool area, which was just a level down and very near our room so my brother didn't have to go out and huddle in the hotel doorway like so many other people we saw at many of the non-smoking properties. \n",
      "The other issue was with the internet connection. We didn't go to SF to surf the net or to work but we both had a couple loose ends to take care of for work. My brother travels for a living so has to connect from hotels wherever he is, so he knew that the problem was not just his computer or his settings like they implied. Long-story-short, they ran us around for several days before a bellman finally admitted that most people had to take their laptops elsewhere and advised us that there was free wi-fi at nearby Union Square. We never found out if it was a temporary problem or they just don't actually have internet available but if they had been honest from the start we could have made other arrangements. Once again, the staff was extremely pleasant but their lack of honestly caused both a lot of frustration and a few problems. \n",
      "*Tip: For the club rooms, the hotel garage entry on O’Farrell is actually much handier than the hotel’s front door. Just a doorway down from there is a little print shop called Cyber Copy where they have internet access available. The guy has a bunch of computers already set up and online so no bothering with special logins or passwords to get connected. He just scribbles your time on a scrap of paper and you bring it back when you’re done and you can even get pages printed if you need. And he’s cheap, too—I think it was $8 an hour broken down every 15 mins. For people who just need to check their emails occasionally it’s probably a better deal than paying for internet in your room—even if you can get it to work.\n",
      "A note about the noise: I'd seen complaints in this forum about noise at the Handlery and many other hotels night. I thought these must be sensitive folks from quiet towns or 'burbs not used to city sounds. After being there, I got it! It is NOISY at night. A couple evenings, after midnight someone started playing music on the street corner below. Another night a fight broke out and went on and on until the cops showed up with sirens blasting. Complaints about the garbage collections are legit too. I thought people posting that were just nit-picking, but this is one loud-mother operation! For us it usually started around 1AM and went on for about an hour while city workers pick up trash cans left out on the sidewalks--with the perpetual safety-beepers blaring, clanging-banging, and noisy mechanical lifts jamming it into the trucks, working their way block by block. We survived. I was able to tune it out reasonably easily after the first night. Maybe the trick was all the walking we did and climbing up & down those near-vertical streets so we were dead tired by bedtime. But I'd advise anyone who is sound sensitive to pick up a white-noise machine or even just run a loud fan to help tune down the decibels. We were on the 3rd floor but I think it was loud enough that even the higher floors might get their share of the noise. Once again, this isn't an issue with the Handlery any more than any of the other hotels in the area. It's the trade-off to be in a such a great location. \n",
      "Overall, despite the few issues with the staff, we really did enjoy staying at the Handlery and our entire trip. We would definitely stay there again. It would be a great choice for most people unless you are a smoker and you absolutely object to stepping out to smoke or you need to use your computer in the room. Bottom line was that it was very clean and so comfortable after being out exploring the city all day. Not luxury—but it more than met our needs. \n",
      "One last suggestion: Skip the Daily Grill attached to the hotel and eat at the Irish bar next door--forgot the name now. It's not fancy at all but they've got very good comfort food, meat & potatoes, and more. They serve late and are very reasonably priced. We give it a big \"thumbs up\"!\n",

The hotel is immaculate. I honestly couldn't find one thing out of place or a speck of dirt...or hair....anywhere. Just a beautiful, new hotel. The pool area is fantastic for the kids. I loved how it was open until 11pm. Nice chairs and tables and ample fresh towels in the pool. Our room was nice and large. The bathroom was roomy with good water pressure and a massaging shower head. Clean, clean, clean..probably the cleanest hotel bathroom that I have ever come across. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The beds were really comfortable. We went down the next morning for breakfast and this is where my one and only complaint comes from. No fresh fruit available. I asked the clerk and was told that they were all out and expecting a \"shipment\" on Monday. This was Saturday, and I would think that someone would run on down to the grocery store and purchase some fresh fruit for the guests on the weekend. Other than that the breakfast area was nice, roomy, clean and the worker there was friendly and accomodating otherwise.\n",

He knew we were ready to leave the Tapatio Cliffs and find something else, but he was so kind pointing out all the good features of the hotel. We were so happy with our suite with the view, all our bad thoughts about the resort quickly disappeared. Dick then called us when he got back down to the front desk to assure us that we could have the suite for our 4 nights and not have to move to less expensive room the next day. \n",

I have really enjoyed every hotel I stayed in (Orchard, Omni, Seal Point Inn, Marriott) - but there is something a little more personal about the Galleria Park that I really liked. Its very covenient for the Moscone and although the room I had was quite small with not much view (just a regular Queen), I felt that I didn't need any more room than that because it was so well-put together. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. I expect to return to this one! \n",

The hotel staff were very friendly, and the hotel layout and facilities were much better than I had expected. The Resort facilities were fantastic and a real pleasure to use. We used the tennis, mini-golf, lazy river and regular pool - all good! The 'casita village' looked like a lovely place to stay, that's something to try on another trip.

As we were at the hotel with friends I went straight up to the 16th floor to check out their room which was lovely.\n",
      "I went back to our room, stopped my husband from unpacking and off we trotted to reception - prepared to do battle. The guy behind the desk couldn't have been nicer. I didn't have to go into any detail, as soon as I said I wasn't happy he said he would move us, he offered us a choice of rooms and recommended that we take the one on the 13th floor which we did. The room was lovely and we settled in to enjoy a wonderful 4 days in New York.\n",

Walls thick enough that I didn't hear my neighbors. Air system that included fan as well as ac/heat so if you just wanted air circulation - and some white noise. Great location. I was very comfortable. Everything seemed new in the room from the furniture to the bath fixtures.(oh, and the shower - water pressure like a fire hose, it was invigorating!)

      "Text: First off, let me say that this is not a review of a Champaign tour or any of that stuff. This is a review of actually staying overnight (2 nights) at The Mansion on O. A friend of ours was in town and booked a room here. It was a suite so he asked us to stay. \n",
      "Parking here was an extra $30 per night and parking was behind one of the nearby buildings down an alleyway. Still, the car was fine even if parking was pretty pricey. Check in was pretty easy - entry was through a door at street level so you didn't have to climb the outside steps whilst schlepping your luggage. The husband of the husband/wife team who run the place took care of us and was friendly and helpful. He gave us a mini tour which was great. We were greeted in a room that looks like a library. Our room was on the 3rd. floor (I think) and it was a suite with a bedroom, livingroom, bathroom, kitchenette and an outside deck.\n",
      "Okay, here's where it gets hairy. The kitchenette was up some stairs and off of the bedroom area. It appeard to have seen better days and I'm not sure the appliances worked but there were no pots/pans. It wasn't any too clean, either so we avoided that area. Off the kitchen was a door to a deck. It looked pretty precarious - wires hanging nearby, etc. I was afraid of stepping out there for fear of falling through - seriously. The bathroom was laid out so that someone could be taking a shower and the sink area was accessable. It was fine but there was carpet throughout the bathroom (here's a ewww factor). The carpet was not real clean as none of the place was very clean - everything was very dusty. Some lint was on the carpet - it was there when we first got there and it was still there when we left - I was careful not to walk barefooted on the floors. We had the sitting room area with a pull out couch. The couch was very comfortable and done up really nicely. The pillows were comfortable and the mattress must have had a topper on it because it was not at all like any pull out couch I've slept on. I'll give them credit here. On the other hand, there was a faux fireplace in the sittingroom area. It was not quite against the wall because the entire wall was hung with art work - all for sale - even behind the fireplace!! There was no place to put your personal items such as a table, etc. because every inch was covered with \"stuff\". There was a huge walk in closet which stored some of \"stuff\" but plenty of room to hang cloths. There was a desk and after moving around the things all over the desk we used that to put our personal items on. As others have said, it's a little overdone with the kitch. There was stuff literally everywhere and everything (except the guitars) was for sale. It was like staying at an estate sale or at your eccentric great aunts old house with all kinds of crap laying around - except your aunt may have dusted from time to time. There is no central a/c so window units were around which wasn't a problem but then you got to looking at the windows and all the peeling paint outside. Maintenance is not one of the strong points of this property.\n",
      "Our room was situated behind a bookcase in the middle of a stairway. The door was a bookcase and the lock was a long spike that you put into the side of the bookcase which went into the wall to keep the door shut. From the inside there was a kind of lock at the top of the door to keep it closed. The spike, when you were gone, was just laid on the shelf behind a magazine or book to conceal it. At first, we put the spike on that shelf - but we were in the room with the inside latch set when some people who were attending a wedding attempted to get into our room. They found the spike, inserted it in the hole and we were locked in!! We had to call the front desk to have them open the room. There was no way to secure the room when you were gone. The sign on the door that said the room was occupied didn't do much good because we had several people tried to get in. When you were out for dinner, you had no choice but to leave the spike on the shelf so anyone could have access to the room. This did not give me a warm fuzzy as I had my laptop and other valuables in the room. \n",
      "I really wanted to like this place because it's the type of place that would grab one's fancy. The rooms were not cookie-cutter rooms like a regular hotel. They were unique and very interesting. The cabin room with a loft area next to ours was really nice as were many of the other rooms we saw. The kitchen was available on a kind of \"help yourself\" basis to fix your own breakfast I guess. We didn't go there because we went walking in the morning and found a place nearby for breakfast. I guess I'd have loved it had they weeded out the junk, cleaned it better by removing all or most of the \"for sale\" stuff from the rooms. Instead, it looks like they're not sure what they want this place to be - an estate sale where you can sleep or a bed and breakfast with interesting art pieces for sale. They need to go one way or another but at present, this isn't working well. \n",
      "I don't know what my friend paid for this room but from the pricing I saw online it's way over the top for what you get. I've traveled for work and stayed at some beautiful B & B's and top notch hotels that weren't near the published price of this place and were much nicer. Published rates for The Fireplace Suite - if you are not a \"member\" (whatever that means) is $900 per night - about $700 per night overpriced in my opinion - and I'm being generous here.\n",
      "I would rate this much higher if I were simply taking a tour rather than staying here because, for a tour the place is really amazing with all the antiques, artwork and collectibles. The diningroom and main floor where events are held was really nice. The intricate corridors and ways to get from place to place, hidden wine cellar and rooms were neat. All that is great - it's the staying and seeing how difficult it was that drove me to the rating I'm giving. Maybe the answer is to run this as a museum and forget about the B&B part?? There seems to be no focus to this place - is it a retreat for musicians? Is it a B&B? Is it an estate sale? I'm not sure but the Mansion on O St. is definitely unique!\n",

We had a corner room and the view of Boston was spectacular. They also run very good deals at this hotel, especially for Marriott Rewards members. We got our corner room on the 23rd floor for just $129! For sushi lovers, you must try the Philadelphia Roll at the sushi bar in the lobby. My husband is a sushi fanatic & he says it is some of the best he's ever had, anywhere! The Cheesecake Factory food was terrible, but the Banana Cream Cheesecake was fabulous. Skip the meal here and just go for dessert! Also, just a 5 minute walk to Copley Station Green Line. Trust me, that is the station you want to pick up the T. It is very safe to travel in Boston on the Green & Red Lines. Stay away from the Orange Line (on the MBTA). It's a little shady.\n",

Although this is an older property, the room was stylish and very comfortable. Even though we arrived later in the evening (10:00) after checking in we walked next door and enjoyed a delicious dinner and drinks at Fly. Upon returning we found the hotel to be very quiet and we slept well in the incredibly comfortable bed. In the morning we ate a delicious breakfast downstairs and then strolled around the city. Even though we were checking out that morning, they clerk graciously stored our bags and kept our car until we were ready to depart much later that afternoon.

The rooms are very quiet, which was shocking considering there was some type of comic/super hero convention going on.

We stayed in a cityview studio king room, which was marvelous. the view of new york city was STUNNING (and let me tell you, being a native New Yorker, it is hard to find a place with a view like that). The room was impeccably clean and attention to detail was outstanding (you can tell a lot of thought went into the design of the rooms). The hotel had a very chic, young, hip vibe and the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly.

My only complaint, were I forced to find one, is that the bed was a little soft and the pillows rather flat, so I didn't sleep quite as well as I do in my own bed. I had toyed with the idea of changing my reservation to the Westin when it offered a big sale right before I left, but I'm so glad I did not.

The best (and worst) thing that was unique to this hotel was the goldfish companion the staff brought to our room upon arrival. I was actually very excited to receive my pet. My sister and I named him Chewy and said goodnight to him before going to sleep. Sadly, the next morning Chewy was floating lifelessly at the top of the fish bowl. Not a pleasant way to start out the day! These things happen I suppose, but I hope the hotel does have some system of trying to prevent it from happening, such as keeping track of how old the fish are and which ones are likely to die soon. Our goldfish was replaced by the time we retuned to the hotel for the night. Chewy II survived for the rest of our stay, thankfully. \n",

My Mom always say \"You get what you pay for.\" That's exactly what you'll get at Mark Hopkins. You pay a higher price for an excellent hotel stay. You will not be disappointed. In fact, I have made another reservation to stay at this hotel while I am in San Francisco for business. I don't think I can ever stay elsewhere. I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Not only was it in a great location, it was also a wonderful hotel. Upon walking in to the hotel, the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Our room did not become available to us until an hour after the normal check in period and the front desk apologized profusely as well as provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates. In addition, the room was very clean and nice. There was a little mini bar, refrigerator, and microwave in the room. In addition, there was a wonderful breakfast everyone morning and little snacks provided in the afternoon. It was a really great hotel and we would definitely stay there again!! In addition, there was a fabulous little Italian restaurant right across the street from the hotel. Definitely try it out one night! And definitely stay at this hotel!!! :)\n",

      "The hotel Lobby is immaculate and greets you with a really warm and inviting atmosphere – especially during the cold month of February. The roaring fire, tasteful décor and mood lighting all help to set the tone for the hotel – welcoming, with a sense of luxury and charm. \n",
      "Before check in, you are greeted by the concierge staff and asked if you would like your bags taken to your room. Obviously, being in America, a tip is expected, but as you are politely asked if you would like this service, you feel under no pressure. We did take up this service and felt that it was well worth the tip.\n",
      "Upon check in, we were informed that we would be staying in a Junior Suite and within minutes, were presented with our key cards – check in at The Lenox is quick and easy! The front desk staff are more than polite; they did all they could to not only welcome us when we arrived, but also made us feel welcome throughout our whole stay, each morning asking how we were and if they could do anything to help, and each evening asking how our day had been. \n",
      "The corridors and communal areas do not let the hotel down; décor is fresh and tasteful, corridors clean and quiet and there are also services such as lifts, ice and water machines etc. We did not use the fitness centre, so cannot comment on this, but from what we saw of it, it look as though it was well equipped with all you would need for a work out.\n",
      "Our room was absolutely beautiful. The furniture and décor fits in with the old feel of the hotel, yet it offers luxury and comfort. Having emailed the hotel prior to our trip to inform them that it was one of our party member’s 30th Birthday, requesting a good view of the city from our room, I was overwhelmed to find that not only had the staff met the request of giving us a room with a lovely view of the city, but they had also left us a welcome note and basket, filled with American goodies – Hershey’s chocolate, bags of pretzels, Boston souvenirs etc. We really were touched by this and it just shows how the staff at The Lenox do go that extra mile!\n",
      "I slept superbly each of the 5 nights of my stay – in the room are two double beds – they are comfortable and you are offered plenty of spare pillows and blankets for the cold winter nights (although these were not needed as there was a very effective heating/air con system which allowed you to fully control the temperature of the room). \n",
      "In the spacious room, we also had a large walk in wardrobe with plenty of hanging space. This wardrobe also housed a very user friendly safe. There was plenty more storage space in the form of a chest of draws; There was also a very large, flatscreen TV which offered loads of entertainment channels. The fridge had complimentary bottled water, which was restocked everyday and the ice machine was conveniently right outside our room.\n",
      "The room offered many other comforts, such as an I-pod docking station, desk and business chair, sofa and coffee table and a beautiful fireplace (not working – just for effect). Oh, and the nightly turn-down service with chocolates on your pillow is a lovely extra touch!\n",
      "The bathroom was cleaned thoroughly everyday and every detail was thought of – hairdryer, phone in the bathroom, plenty of clean towels (if needed, although The Lenox are an environmentally friendly hotel and do encourage re-use), extractor fan, dressing gowns, complimentary toiletries and even ornate gold-effect taps! It really was lovely!\n",
      "When we holiday in America, we do like to get out and try the local food, so we did not eat breakfast in the hotel. Although, each morning, there are complimentary tea and coffee facilities set up in the lobby. Nor did we eat dinner at The City Table – but we have read excellent reviews about this restaurant. We did visit the Hotel’s Irish Bar on a couple of occasions – The Solas – and this was a lovely atmosphere, with TV screens for sports fans. We ate here on one evening and I can thoroughly recommend this place to eat – especially considering that food is served til late – 1am if I remember correctly - great after a long day of sightseeing. On this note, it is also worth mentioning that although we did not use room service, the menu was very reasonably priced. \n",
      "I have stayed in 5 star hotels in the Caribbean, been on 4/5* cruise liners, and I can honestly say that this is possibly the nicest hotel I have stayed in. The staff work so hard to make your stay special and it felt so great to return ‘home’ to The Lenox after a day of walking through the city.\n",
      "Practical info on the hotel – nearest T Station is Copley (green line) and this is about a 2 minute walk. You are located right by The Prudential Centre (Tower and Shopping Mall) and Copley Square, with Trinity Church and The John Hancock Tower just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. A Taxi from Logan cost us around $30, including tip. You must also try Whiskey’s Bar, just down the street!\n",

We told them a concert and a car would be waiting for us when we were ready. We headed up to the room, and our bags soon followed. Upon entering, you feel as though you are in a posh manhattan apartment and NOT a hotel room! the decor is fabulous and immediately we felt pampered. waiting for us was a plate of cheese, crackers, and chocolate covered strawberries (which was very fresh), along with a fully stocked fridge and snack draw with everything imaginable that you could want. As we were getting ready for the night, my cousin realized she forgot her heels in the car and went down to the lobby to retrieve her car to get them. the conceirge told us that there was no need and he would send someone to get the heels for her out of the car. Ten minutes later he showed up at our door with the shoes. we headed downstairs to take the towncar to the concert. the driver opened the door for us and said that he had jay z playing in the car for us!

The room is the standard layout, which is not a criticism, just a comment to provide some bearings. The room, a queen bed, was a comfortable size. It was beautifully appointed and supremely clean. Proof that luxury can be done right without the need to garish opulence. Staff members were excellent. Obviously, Omni’s training of their staff is top notch and their expectations of service are nothing but first class. Other guests in the party were greeted by name and they also had stayed only one night—amazing. This is one of the few hotels that I was truly disappointed to leave without the opportunity to experience more—a rarity even in some of my favorite hotels.

The Drury Plaza is an absolute gem!! We stayed in the new tower building in a huge riverview suite. The room had a huge balcony that overlooked the riverwalk and downtown. It was very spacious with 2 chairs. The hotel is located at the beginning of the riverwalk, but it's location is excellent, because it is quiet at night, but it has quick and easy access to all that the riverwalk has to offer.\n",
      "Everything about this hotel is excellent. From the moment we checked in, the service was great, the people were so friendly and ready to help. Everyone that you walk by says \"hello\" and asks how your stay is going. The cleaning staff are very friendly and accomodating, and always smiling. The true bonus here is the incredible amount of food that the hotel offers at no extra charge. They have a huge buffet breakfast with hot items like eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy (yum!). They also have a \"5:30 Kickback\" cocktail hour which is amazing!!! Each person gets three free (alcoholic!) drinks and tons of yummy \"bar food\" snacks like nachos and chicken fingers. If you stay on the weekends though, get there early!!! The lines for food/drinks were very loooong, but worth it! You could absolutely stay at this hotel and never have to buy any food--although that would be a shame because San Antonio has some of the best! \n",
      "The hotel also has a very cool rooftop pool and a few terraces were you can hang out and overlook the city. The pool was clean and refreshing with a great backdrop. Plus, it is open until 10pm! They also have a nice indoor pool as well if the weather is not cooperating that day. \n",
      "The room was super nice!! VERY large, with a sitting are and a nice, big bedroom. There were two large flat screen TV's -- a big plus! They also have nice, large, clean bathrooms. THe room feels so clean I had no issues walking on the carpets with my bare feet! They also have free wi-fi, which is yet another great plus. It also has managed to keep some of the \"historic\" feel to it while still being quite modern. \n",
      "I know some people wrote about this hotel and said that there are \"bums\" around the hotel. Well, yes, there are bums, because this is a city!! Some bums do hang out under the overpass that you walk through to get to/from the hotel to riverwalk, however, this has nothing to do with the hotel, and it not something that they can fix. The bums are nowhere near the hotel!! Plus, the hotel is only accessable with your hotel card, so there is no chance that random people can just wander in. It's a city, the bums are there-- ignore them and they ignore you. Plus, you can walk on the \"street side\" to get to the hotel as well, if that makes you more comfortable. \n",

They gave me great rates. While the area isnt the greatest for sight seeing I was very glad I chose to book with them. Very clean and I had everything I might possilby need. Included breakfast, a nice pool, and the over all look of the outside(plant life and hotel) was very attractive and relaxing for me. They even made arrangements for a taxi service for me to get around. The staff was so helpful. And so friendly. If I ever get back to the area I would be sure to rebook with them or suggest to friends. :)\n",

Cedric and Nikita at the front desk were wonderful representatives for the Hilton - they made us feel so welcome and really knew their stuff. Valet staff and housekeeping were super as well. Was a bit concerned about the \"nightclub problem\" but i can honestly say it did not bother any of us in the least, and our room overlooked the nightclub. Don't let that stop you from staying at this wonderful hotel! The property is brand new and the rooms are very clean and comfortable (and believe me - i'm impossible to please!). The neighborhood is up and coming - some beautiful new buildings are being built and i suspect that in the next few years our family would be priced out of it this hotel and area. Metro access is too good to be true, and the Harris Teeter market (i know, it's a funny name) is on par with Bristol Farms for those of you on the west coast. It is absolutely beautiful and a great place to grab something for breakfast or lunch (many prepared items, great sandwiches) on your way to the metro.

Somehow they have managed, as a brand new establishment, to pull off the ambience of a venerable NYC institution (think the Algonquin) while still being contemporary. The rooms hold many nice touches. I am fussy about light, and I particularly appreciated the numerous lighting options and settings. Also loved the floor-to-ceiling window with a great view of the City and its lights. We kept saying that our room somehow reminded us of our former Manhattan apartment, but we didn't know how or why. Now I realize it probably was because we weren't in midtown, and the view of the neighborhood had that, well, neighborhood feel. The minibar held some unique choices (and definite firsts), as well. As others note, the Bowery staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. I don't know where else I have come across staff members -- reception, bellhops, housekeeping, waiters -- who seem so genuinely (as opposed to obsequiously) happy to greet you. The one downside (for us) is that the hotel is just a little too self-consciously \"hip\" at the moment.\n",

I ended up fighting with them for 2 months after my last stay, just to get them to do what they said they would do! I had to follow up with them several times, in order to get them to keep their promises. That is really sad, when you can't even expect them to keep their word. I wont go into any more details of that stay, because it's already in here somewhere. This time, however, we are again.....not happy at all! The ONLY thing this place has to offer is the location. You will find that they are experts at finding ways to get tip money from you by hijacking your luggage, etc. You will find that the drinks they make you in the bar will be TERRIBLE, and cost $15.00 each. They don't even have a blender and cannot make frozen type drinks. Why not? Can't Hilton afford a blender? You will find that the wireless internet service will not stay connected. The signal will go in and out and have to keep trying to re-connect. We had 2 different laptops with us and they both had the same problem. We ended up going accross the street to the Star Bucks to use the internet from there. We also ended up using the Applebees (located inside the Hilton) for drinks. There is NO pool or and NO spa! The gym is very small and poorly equipped. We also expected poliote/respectful/professional staff. And, sadly, this proved to not be true as well. They were less than helpful with us on several occassions and were downright rude as well. We understood that this would be expensive. After all, it's Times Square! But, we also expected things to work! And that the food and drinks would be good (for those prices), and we are sad to report that we cannot give the Hilton a good report. AND that this is the second time in a row! Once in Phoenix and once here in Times Square-New York city. We have been traveling now for over 2 weeks. We went to England, France, Germany, etc. And all of our accomadations at the other places where we stayed, were great!. None of them were Hilton! So we have stayed in different Hotels every night for the last couple of weeks, and everyone did a better job than Hilton.

The room had many options for lighting from business bright to mood casual. My room was exceptionally clean and in like new condition. The bed was very comfortable with real down/feather pillows which I prefer. Overall I just can not say enough good things about this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. I stayed for business so I can not actually recall what it cost because I just expensed it, but I don't think it was extraordinarily expensive if I recall correctly. Two thumbs up big for this hotel!

I am a single mom so a budget friendly hotel was high on our list and free parking topped it off as I didn't want to drive any more than need be in a town that size. We met family who also stayed there and we all just parked and walked/cab/bus for the long weekend. The hotel was clean, staff were friendly, and the kids loved the pool. Since the rooms are open to the courtyard, and there is music at night - be prepared to hear noise until midnight- but it was promptly shut down as promised right on time (families with small children should beware though just in case). Many posts talk about the sketchy part of town and yes, across the street is probably the beginning of scarry - we actually walked to the Giants game and them home at 10:30 at night and we were a little nervous but were never approached by anyone and just kept an arm around the pre-teens and didn't engage with anyone by eye contact or voice. My only complaint or wish was that they would have some hot cocoa packets or a container of juice so the kids could have had something to drink in the mornings - - We would definately stay here again.\n",

They always booked an entire month, we usually stayed with them for a week. We stayed in a cottage 3 back from the beach. The cottage is was large enough to sleep 4 people very comfortably and it is just steps from the beach. The cottages are decorated very nicely and the staff are very accomodating. We slept with the windows wide open so that we could hear the ocean waves, very relaxing. There are plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance and there are plenty of little shops for those who are like me and need a souvenir from every place that I stay. Another perk is that the Crystal Pier is right down the boardwalk. The cottages have kitchenettes with a small set of dinnerware and silverware, so you can bring food and prepare it there, there are also barbeques as well. It is a family friendly place with ping pong tables for the kids. If you want to be close to the beach with all the comforts of home, the Beach Cottages is the place to be.\n",

Not quite sure why there are all these great reviews. For a little more $$, one can stay in a much nicer hotel in a safer area. I stayed for one night for a quick visit to Columbia with my teenage sons and would not return. We had two rooms, one was billed as a suite. Really tiny. The hotel is very old, the decor is really old, the rooms are small and dark. The air conditioner (which is attached to the window and old) made so much noise it was difficult to sleep. The view out of the windows is into a dark alley and an ugly buidling next door. I will say that the rooms are clean and the staff was nice. The bathrooms have been updated. However, I felt uncomfortable and unsafe during my stay. It has a very \"seedy\" feel to it. I saw one of the staff very thoroughly check out my as yet undeveloped 13 year old daughter.

The hotel was very nice, and the location was very central just off of busy M Street NW on 30th. Despite its proximity to the shopping district, the hotel was very quiet. Georgetown U was a short cab ride away, and we walked to George Washington U. The suite was complete with a full kitchen--big refrigerator, microwave, sink, stovetop, cabinets. I can't remember if there was an oven. The bed and pillow were very comfortable--I did not even have to use the pillow I travel with! There were many closets and a dresser and desk. The hotel features Bath and BodyWorks shampoo, etc--always a plus for me! Breakfast included cereal, fruit, yogurt, cereal bars, PopTarts, toast, good bagels, pastries, muffins, coffee, tea, etc. I was very happy with the rate although I will warn that there is a parking fee of $18 per day. You do have unlimited in/out privileges. Also note that the ceilings were low--I am not sure an SUV could fit in there. Check with the hotel. We stayed at the 30th Street location, having read on TripAdvisor that it was preferred. It has a nice courtyard off of 30th Street that was pretty with landscaping. Recommendation for dinner is Bangkok Joe's, Asian cuisine, very tasty and upscale but not too pricey. Great location at 3000 K Street NW (walking distance from the hotel) and in the fun Washington Harbor area (shops, dining, people watching, harbor walk). M Street has lots of shops and restaurants too. All in all, a great hotel in a great location.\n",

      "Text: My husband and I just returned today from a four day vacation in Washington. What a great city! Stayed at the Residence Inn. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It was clean and the staff were friendly and reasonably helpful. The room was large. We had a studio suite which had a full kitchen and sitting room. We didn't really use the kitchen as we were out so much but it was nice to have the refrigerator,etc. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom was ok and with no shortage of towels. The a/c - heating system was noisy and we had to turn the fan off in order to sleep. It was a definite plus having the complimentary breakfast each morning. It was quite good and with more variety than I expected. The staff in the a.m. were fantastic. The complimentary dinner/social was ok (served Mon,Tues,Wed). Again more food and variety than I expected...not gourmet for sure but ok and great for families. The hotel was close to the metro which was great but had no restaurants or pubs nearby which was a definite negative. It would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel. Able to walk to most attractions. Hot tub was nice...didn't use the pool. We had an issue with the fee at the hotel. I booked on-line at the Washington.org website. I thought that I was booking directly thru the Marroitt, however apparently it was thru a third party. I was given a price when I booked and then another price from the hotel. The price from the hotel was lower. I called the hotel twice (from Canada) and was told both times that the lower price was what I would pay. Not the case. I called 'the 3rd party' and was told by them that they would call the hotel to talk with the manager to straightened the price out. When we arrived at the hotel I tried to explain the situation to the manager but felt that he totally dismissed us with very little conversation at all. He barely listened to us and walked away while I was talking to him. Not a very nice welcome to the hotel. When I mentioned Marriott rewards he waved his hand and mumbled something about \"no Marriott rewards with this type of booking.\". Not sure what that was all about. Despite the unpleasant experience that we had with the manager we enjoyed the hotel, however I'm not sure that I would stay there again because of that!\n",

Last year when staying there, I was reminded that the hotel opened in the mid 1960s . A few months ago, I tried to get into the hotel and found that rates were nearly 500 per night, thanks to the Hilton Club concept which seems to have cut the available rooms to ordinary folk to about half of the total, resulting in twice the price.\n",
      "I took a chance and decided to stay in Soho, where a pal of mine owns a great jewelry store, and found the above sheraton. When I checked in, the desk staff acted as if I was a long time lost person who had come home for good. In a flash I was in my room, all new and nice, with internet that worked like a charm ( I seem to remember a german phrase - mit raazender geschwindekuit- or something like that- with great speed) and a very very nice room for a very very good price. Best of all, elevators that got you to your room on floor 14 with even more speed than ever in a hotel in new york. No waiting.\n",
      "Once I checked in, I found the staff eager to help me get around the city, and where to walk to. All kinds of flower shops, my pals store, and every imaginable kind of cool stores are available. plus, something you will never see in mid town, nice little bakeries, pizza places, and restaurants of every type. \n",
      "The rooms. like many at any four points sheraton, are modern design, and not the traditional heavy woods,and massive chairs, but very very comfortable and well appointed. There was even a power strip for those of us who think we are to be in touch with 2 phones, two laptops, and of course an ipod. So for the first time in years, my own power strip was deployed to remain in the suitcase. \n",
      "In walking around, I was able to visit my pals store in soho, visit art galleries, and frankly enjoy myself despite having heavy duty finance meetings ever day over 4 days. My worst fear- not being able to get a cab, or being forced to use the subway a lot- were never realised. Despite it being a small hotel at least by gotham city standards, there was always a cab waiting out front. Also the cab fare to LaGuardia was about 10 bucks less than the trip to midtown. \n",
      "Now it turns out that soho is considered a new emerging area for tech companies, lofts, and young people. If you want to enjoy the City of New York, consider staying here. Its my new home.\n",

      "I had a one bedroom Suite on the second floor that overlooked the neighbor’s home that was being painted. So there was a strong odor of something. When I complained to the front desk about the odor they suggested they could spray aerosol spray to cover the smell. Having asthma I didn’t take this option. The manager came up to the room and try to explain hotels had a tendency to have odors that were unpleasant. We went out and figured we would air the room out however the home next to the Suites was being painted. Because of the odor I landed up have some issues. The hotel doctor is very nice. He is expensive but nice.\n",
      "I asked for a room change but was told the hotel was full but I can call back at midnight and talk to the night manager. I called to request a room change and was given the option of a room directly next to the one I was in or one across the hall. I took the room across the hall because it didn’t have an odor. My niece and I went out for the day and came back in mid-afternoon and the same odor was in the room again. When I called down to the desk the only thing they could say is that this is the odor of the hotel. \n",
      "All in the staff hotel was not very helpful with the odor. On my last day there I found out that the hotel was painting rooms on the 3rd floor so the odor may not be there all the time.\n",
      "The other issue is that the hotel does not have a concierge there all the time to assist with your plans or day trips. They have strange hours for days (9am-11am) and nights (6pm-8pm). The kicker was that they called my hotel room 3 days after I checked in asking me if I wanted my welcome kit. Welcome kit is nothing special it was the materials that I picked up at visitors center.\n",
      "Don’t use the room service. The food isn’t worth it. You can find great restaurants down on the Wharf or surrounding areas.

San Francisco seems to close down earlier in the winter than in the spring and summer. \n",

Well, the lobby was the only good part about this hotel. After arriving in our room, we couldn't believe how small it was. You could almost stand in the bathtub and still reach the sink to brush your teeth! It looked like a very old, run down building that had a lot of knick-knacks and trendy furniture added to it, to try to justify the high price. This was literally the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in and we have traveled considerably in the states and abroad. Besides the $8 bottle of water in the fridge, you could find an \"intimacy kit\" complete with condoms and lubricating jelly and some waxed lips in your room. Gross! Yes, the \"L\" is outside your window, and is pretty loud but it is the least of your worries. Don't leave your window shades up, as there are perverts in the office buildings next door that like the watch the guests. This hotel isn't really next to anything, except the \"L\" and the Sears Tower. Do yourself a favor and stay down by Lake Michigan. There were many nicer hotels in that area of town. There was constant, thumping loud music coming from the d.j. spinning records in the lobby and the hallways were so dark you could barely see your way around. They were also having some model shoot in the lobby as well, which was weird. Their \"King Sized Bed\" room was not a king. It was a double. They had a fleece throw on top of the bedspread that had little hairs all over it. I will never stay there again. I am glad I can say I experienced the W hotels though, so I know never to make the same mistake. Stay in a Westin. They are much nicer and not as expensive or \"trendy.\" The only reason one would stay here is to rent a room by the hour! The W Chicago says Trashy, not Classy!\n",

We have been traveling to Boston Children's for our son's complex heart condition for nearly 10 years now, but until recently we have not been fortunate enough to obtain reservations here during our stay. This hotel seemed to be very popular and availability limited. Once we experienced the Inn at Longwood, we began scheduling planned hospitalizations for our son around the hotel's room availability! We had found out first hand why it was so popular and didn't want to have to return to staying elsewhere. During our last two emergency hospital stays, the inn had no vacancies, but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room. The first time their desk clerk, Amy, (with the help of the manager, Bill Davies) managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim. Then just last week we were again faced with the \"no room at the inn\" situation and about to give up. The manager, Bill Davies, went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament. We were just about to give up late at night (after checking back frequently during the day for availability) when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us. It is so refreshing to find that there are still caring people out there who will help you when the chips are down. We will be returning to Boston and The Inn at Longwood again tomorrow for more medical treatment, and are thankful to have this refuge during times of struggle.\n",

The king bed was very comfortable and there was no road noise. A lot of the room showed wear & tear, old carpet, scuffed furniture etc which I didn't expect in this price bracket.\n",

      "Text: I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions for business and once with family on vacation. If you are watching your budget, this may not be the hotel for your next trip. This is a hotel from a bygone era. Don't let the modern facade of the building fool you. As soon as you enter the hotel and make your way to the reception desk and see the vaulted ceilings and furnishings, you can feel yourself going back in time. The front desk staff is most attentive and often have people from all over the world working there. They are quick to help and guide you on any question or concern. The location is right in downtown San Diego. You can walk to most anything. Shopping, eating and site seeing can all start from this location. Restaurants abound at all prices, cuisine and ambiance. Shopping is nearby and again in different price ranges. When you step off the elevator and circle around to your room, you know you are in a very nice hotel. Each two rooms share a single \"keyed\" entrance to an anteroom. Then you enter your own room. Spacious is the word. The decor is beautiful. Everything in its right place. The bathroom is as big as you will see. Comfortable bed and heating/air-conditioning. I haven't used the hotel eating facility, because of the large number of choices nearby. I would recommend Maria's Mexican Restaurant at 1011 4th Avenue. It's a hole in the wall, but the people are very nice and the food is quite good. The workout room is well maintained with good equipment. The USS Midway is a \"must see.\" There is a showroom with restored cars (for sell) in the wonderful gaslight District that is well worth visiting.

      "First, I used Starwood points for the stay and had requested a view of the pool. We were very pleased with our room. It was on the 4th floor and was plenty big enough for the 4 of us, with a nice sitting area, balcony, large bathroom & of course, the Westin Heavenly beds. Whether my room was bigger than the majority of the rooms at the resort I'm not sure. I did notice that there was ongoing construction on the outside of the 1st floor rooms that faced the driveway (we speculated it had to something to do with some of the complaints of dampness that visitors have mentioned in earlier posts.) The Westin has a great location for families: just down the street from Six Flags and an easy drive to Sea World. Expect however about a 25-30 minute drive to the Riverwalk area.\n",
      "Second, my family loved the pool facilities. The staff handed out pool toys for the kids to use without any rental charge. All of the facilities seemed nice but I have to admit that we did not eat at the restaurants since we were visiting relatives nearby.\n",
      "Third, like many of the other posts I did notice problems with the service that you would not get at similar resorts. We had problems on both days that we ordered lunch by the pool. The food was unreasonably slow in coming out of the kitchen, despite the fact that the pool area, at midweek, was not crowded at all. Both waitresses got simple orders wrong and I was finally forced to go to the bar and ask for silverware.\n",
      "Finally, a word about the parking. Do not pay the $12 per day valet charge. The self parking is not that far. I feel like some of the earlier posts complaining about the distance are from travelers accustomed to staying at motels were your car in right in front of your room. \n",

Prompt service from room service, valet car pickup requests, and on premises restaurant, Ame. \" Is there anything else I can do for sir ?\" was a common question with each encounter with this hotel's staff. Stay here if you like contemporary furnishings, spectacular city views. Lobby bar and lounge is popular with locals and can get busy and noisy later in the evening. Well designed lobby and public areas, perhaps this property is not for you if you prefer traditional furnishings, though. I enjoy the complimentary coffee available in the mornings on the fourth floor by the casual restaurant and the large L shaped gym on 5. I did not use the 6th floor pool or spa, however. Prompt and thorough housekeeping staff and eager to please turn down service in the evenings, with every request met promptly and willingly. Museum of Modern Art is next door, and Metreon Center is across the street for films, Union Square and Market St. shopping just a few blocks away. My only negative observation is that the room/suite furnishings are looking slightly worn, some stains on the mohair sofa, and wood furniture looking very slightly scratched. Lovely thick towels, bathrobes, generous toiletries. Closet and drawer space is very limited however, a common design flaw among higher end contemporary hotels, I find. High speed elevators with rarely more than a few seconds wait.

      "Text: Quite Simply -- this hotel is highly overrated. The service, as noted by others, is lacking. I was looking at the Hudson and this Hotel for a three day stay in New York over New Years. I chose the Gansevoort for its location in the Meatpacking district and reputation as a fun area to stay. The district is entirely commercial during the day, and only at night does the area come alive. Most of the people coming into the area are coming for the local clubs. But if you plan on seeing the rest of the city, the location puts you a further cab ride away. I reserved the grand deluxe room. The room was small, but clean and had a modern design. The bathrooms were nice for NY standards. The view was of the meat packing district and the river. However, the heater in the room would not turn off (call one to the front desk). Then the mini bar key was locked with no key (call two). Then the remote control did not work (call three). Not exactly what I expected for nearly $700 a night. The lobby is small and the rooftop bar is equally small, especially when tented during the winter. The NY party was packed with very little seating and completely indoors (also ran $175 per person just for drinks and a few appetizers). For my last day I decided to try the W Tuscany on Park Avenue. It had a small lobby...but the rooms were just as nice as the Gansevoort and MUCH bigger for $319 a night. Although a more business location...the hotel was much closer to most of NYC's attractions. I also visited the Hudson to see what I missed out on. The Hudson still has the Gansevoort beat on style. The Library Bar and main Bar are beautiful, as is the garden bar. Just a much more hip hotel.\n",

I wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday with a trip to Philadelphia so that she could take in all the historic sites and great food that the city has to offer. I knew nothing about Penn’s View Inn prior to booking my reservations and knowing that my wife prefers quaint, historic, bed & breakfast lodging over four and five star any day – I wanted to give this establishment a try. Well – I am very pleased to say that not only was my wife surprised but I was very impressed also. The staff (Antonio – the Manager) personally escorted us to our room and you could tell he was very knowledge about the hotel and the surrounding area. The room was a small suite on the fifth floor (Room 508). It was perfect – from our balcony we could see the river and in the other direction we could see the steeple of Christ Church. Dinner in the hotel’s restaurant was first class – and the room service was quick and courteous. When you read this review you have to ask why should I believe this guy…well…I have stayed in numerous four and five star hotels in many major cities and in Hawaii and even as a Rewards Member of two of the major hotels I have not been this impressed with attention to service and detail. Also, the different driver’s from the limo company that I used daily for our three day get-away all had great things to say about the establishment – and they got nothing for saying it either. Nice walk to the historic sites and really great little shops only a few steps away on Market Street. Enjoy. ****One little thing extra - when we arrived at the hotel the first night my wife walked into the lobby with a bouquet that I had the driver bring to the airport...it was not in a vase...without asking...and this may seem to be a common sense thing...the lady checking us in brought a vase to my wife with a pair of scissors...little things like that is what I am talking about...when we left the beautiful bouquet was proudly displayed at the hotel's front desk...\n",

Most memorable driver was Ike, I believe he drives weekdays only, very outgoing, comedic, almost felt like a tour guide. Location is also good, across the street from major grocery store, some other restaurants down Morrissey Blvd and right by the hotel.\n",
      "One minor thing, ensure to put your privacy please card in the door, or hotel lock on, at night or until you leave the room and are ready to have it cleaned.

One housekeeping lady even let herself into my room after not hearing me say \"just a minute\". \n",

The pool is lovely and so fun--BBQ and island music to listen to while you relax or play in the pool. Dive in movies at night--this place was awesome for kids! The restaurant's food was fabulous. The Jamaican Buffet and live steel drum music was the best night for us! The staff, service, and rentals for watersports was great. The Bahia Belle Boat Cruise was fantastic.

My first New York experience was staying at the Marriott Marquis, but that was when I did not have to foot the bill!! Prime location, especially when you are 19 and single (living off of mom and dad) was definately needed back then. And the Marquis was the best. But now travelling with children; security, cleanliness and budget comes first. We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We were in a great location! We could see the World Trade site from the hallway while awaiting the elevator. The HUGE discount department store 21 was very near the hotel as were the subway stations! It was very easy to catch a cab by the help of the bellman. The conceirge helped us with finding Bubby's restaurant in Tribeca. And even when it was pouring down rain, the front desk gave us nice umbrellas!! Location is everything and surprisingly the Marriott was the best location to suit our needs. We left the hotel early every morning and returned after 10 PM every evening. I felt very safe and secure. We shopped and dined all day and when it was time to retire, it was nice to return to a quiet uncrowded area to unwind. We ate the breakfast buffet in the morning, a bit pricey at $20 per person (children were half price). The spread was fantastic, though. Everything you would ever want, from fresh fruit to made to order omelets. The fitness center and pool were very nice also. The entire hotel was spotless. We stayed in the corner room with 2 queen beds and plenty of space to spread out.There was a nice bureau and a desk with a chair and a lounging chair. The beds were out of this world comfy!!! The bathroom was full sized and very euro chic. And most importantly, CLEAN!! All in all, I have not one bad thing to write about the Marriott Financial District!\n",

Our stay at the Comfort Inn was excellent! From the first day that my fiancé and I checked in, we encountered incredible costumer service. The staff at the Comfort Inn, Kyle (The Manager), Rachelle, and Kevin went over and beyond the call of duty to make sure our stay in Washington was great. The hotel was very clean, which is very important to me, because I am a huge Germ-a-phobe. They also had complementally breakfast which was great. It included eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, cereal, and much more. It was great waking up every morning and not having to worry about where we were going to eat breakfast. They also had fresh coffee, ice water with lemon in it, and fresh hot chocolate chip cookies in the lobby for the guest. The hotel was in the perfect location for everything . We drove from Atlanta, GA; which is 700 miles away and during our stay there, we did not have to drive our car at all. They also had free Wi-Fi so you could connect to their internet. Their rates per night were very reasonable better than any of the other hotels that I researched. The valet parking staff Kevin, was very professional and courteous. The next time we go back to Washington, Dc we will be defiantly staying at the Comfort Inn again. I would not stay anywhere else but there. I would recommend to ANYONE who is thinking about taking a trip up to Washington, Dc to stay at the Comfort Inn in Downtown DC you will not disappointed. I guarantee it.\n",

      "Text: The Best Western at Pioneer Square was a real treat for us staying before and after an Alaskan cruise. I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. \n",
      "For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again. It was a real treat and a step back in time, since it is an historical hotel.\n",

The hotel is located on East 34th Street between Lexington and 3rd Ave. The subway (green line) is only a block or so away and the good thing about this location is that the station at Union Square is great for changing to other lines. Cross town buses were easily picked up – from west to east, alight just beyond Park Ave or at 3rd Ave. You can also catch a bus to the East River Ferry in 34th Street too so it is quite a handy location.\n",
      "Adjacent to the Affinia Dumont is a restaurant “the Barking Dog”, and a Baskins Robbins ice creamery. There’s also a Thai restaurant and a Deli on the corner too. Opposite the Affinia Dumont is a Duane Reade pharmacy and market which is handy if you need to top up medications or other items or see a doctor (weekdays only).\n",
      "We bought fruit at the street vendor cnr 34th / 3rd Ave as his fruit was nicer and cheaper than in the Deli / Duane Reade. Nice bread (as opposed to plastic wrapped varieties) can be bought at any of the Zabars bakeries in grand Central.\n",
      "Along 3rd and Lexington Aves there are many other restaurants and cafes and shops and on some weekends, Lexington Ave has a street fair which runs from 34th to about 23rd Street.\n",

Our room was nicely maintained by housekeeping and always spic and span when we came back from being out and about.\n",
      "If there was one small critiscm, there were no cooking utensils such as eg flips and large spoons suitable for stirring a pot etc and only one large bowl which we used to put fruit in. However it wasn’t a great concern as we ate out most of the time or brought back cooked food from nearby restaurants / delis after all, we were on holidays.\n",
      "Laundry facilities\n",

      "Internet access is available throughout hotel and during our stay, the cost was $13.95 per day. I didn't see any nearby cafes apart from one on 28th/Lexington Ave that actually had a notice that free WiFi was available and I certainly didn't feel like lugging my Notepad around NYC to go to a Burger King just to get free WiFi. The way I figured it was that I could pay $13.95 for internet access every now and then or go to a cafe and order a couple of coffees which with tip would probably be similar to the cost of access through the hotel.\n",

From check-in on it was a wonderful experience. They offered to upgrade me to the concierge level in an executive corner suite, but I preferred the layout of the Luxury suite, so I asked to please keep my original reservation. I did not realize that I would have been on the 17th floor instead of the 8th with free breakfast, but I liked my Luxury suite. \n",
      " We had a corner suite, room 801. This room was VERY nice and modern. 3 TVs including one in the bathroom mirror. 2 bathrooms, one with a giant soaking whirlpool tub. The only downside of the room is there was no fridge. The \"in-room vending\" is what your fridge is, no room to put your own things in. We had to fill our little sink with ice to keep our wine cold.\n",
      "Bed was soft, a little too soft. But big and the linens were very comfortable. I hate scratchy cheap bedding, so this was an added perk. But all in all the room was exactly what I hoped for, an area with a full couch and coffee tables, another table with two chairs by the window, and a desk with two chairs by the window by the bed. We were very impressed and felt the price was worth it. FYI they are running a special until the end of the year, we got this suite for $150 off of the normal price.

MGM had a temporary casino for years and the only dinning option was the buffet (and a small cafe). My husband and I loved this buffet. It was a little pricey, but the food was always top-notch and plentiful. Well when they opened the new buffet, they lowered the prices a little and the quality of the food as well. There did not seem to be as many choices and the food stations are way spread-out. The Asian cuisine was the highlight. Not much else that I found to be appetizing. I think the purposely lowered the prices, so people that want to spend a little more will go to one of the expensiv-o restaurants (Bourbon Steak House and Salt Water) which the entrees were around $35-$50 each. This is just my conjecture, but one FACT is the buffet quality went down from the old casino.\n",

Like many, we seek out Embassy Suites when traveling with the kids as you can't beat the suite rooms, free breakfasts, manager's receptions, and atrium space. There are 2 Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago very close to each other and I ultimately chose this one based on its 2008 remodel. Although nothing that follows spoiled our stay, here are my gripes having paid about $200/night: (1) The bathroom needed maintenance and housekeeping. The curved shower curtain rod was so loose that the curtain wouldn't stay closed on either end; grout along the top of the tub appeared mold-ready; floor tile never sparkled; tub faucet was loose; light bulb was out for days; toilet paper dispenser placement required you to be a contortionist to access it; and the absence of any venting fogged up the entire suite during showers leaving visible moisture everywhere. And, (2) despite the ES website touting new flatscreens in the living room areas, we had an old tube TV; (3) we waited over an hour for an extra blanket and pillow to be delivered for the kids sleeping on the pull-out sofa; (4) our food tray from room service (dirty dishes) sat out in the hall for 2 days; (5) the chlorine was too strong in the tiny pool; (6) the bar sink faucet was loose; (7) creamer packets for coffee weren't always replaced; (8) and there were never enough hand towels (there are 3 separate in-room sinks). Still, we rate ES Chicago Downtown Lakefront very good - and a little more \"attention to the details\" would have earned it excellent. (PS: Cheers to the hardworking bar staff during the nightly manager's reception!)\n",

      "Was our first time staying in New York City and we were traveling under a tight budget.. Decided on this hotel for the price and location.. to be honest, after narrowing it down.. it was between Hotel Mela in at 6th and 44 or this one.. and we were definitely glad we chose Four Points ( we visited the Hotel Mela lobby and checked out the location ).. \n",
      "The rooms were so clean at Four Points and the hotel looked new/modern.. my girlfriend is a freak for the clean so I had to be careful which hotel in NYC I was choosing.. let me tell you that if she thought this hotel was clean, you're going to think that it's clean.. starbucks coffee in the room (sweet!), iron, hair dryer, modern washroom, very clean and comfortable beds, great climate control, view is ok. \n",
      "Staff are amazing.. you get the feeling they really love what they're doing.. no better staff in NYC to start your day with and to come home to.. they greet you with a smile every time to pass the lobby and were so helpful to us in giving us directions and answering any of our questions about NY.\n",
      "Walking distance to Soho shops, restaurants, convenience store, liquor store, starbucks, deli and when going out to see the city it is a 2 min walk north to the red subway line and less than 5 mins walk to the blue line at 6th and spring.. once you're on the subway you can get anywhere within 10-15 mins(central park, times sq, brooklyn bridge, MSG).. and $8 a day gets you unlimited access to the subway (deal!).. Wouldn't want to stay in the central area (times or midtown) since it looked way too busy and noisy (just can't relax to that)..\n",
      "One tip if you've decided to stay here is not to visit the restaurant or bar unless you have money to burn.. like I said, the Soho restaurants are within walking distance (around Prince st or Broadway) and the liquor store is at Prince and 6th\n",

Upon Checking into the hotel the front desk was very friendly and welcomed us to the hotel. Our room was wonderful and after waiting about 5 minutes our luggage arrived and they put everything in the right spot. The view was of downtown Indianapolis. It was great!! The room was very nice with the regular amenities, and the beds were nice and plush. We decided to eat in the room for dinner. The food menu is that of the restaurant Hot Tuna. (Hot Tuna looked very nice at night with the blue light ceiling.) The food was great (Filet Mignon- cooked to perfection!) We were so glad that we were able to eat in our room and not have to go out to another location and pay the same price for the same food. There always seemed to be some type of management in the entry of the hotel. They made sure that we didn't need anything and they were very friendly. They also came by and adjusted our clocks so we would be ready for the time change. The Sunday brunch at Hot Tuna was very good. It was about 16 dollars, but they had everything and that included your drink!! They also serve Starbucks in the coffee house. We called to get our luggage taken down and to check out of the room. They arrived within 3 minutes and got all of our bags. By the time we took the elevator down and turned in our room keys, our entire vehicle was packed! They put everything where it belonged!! We were so impressed. They even put our newspaper up front for us to read. They were very nice and made sure we had directions to where we were going. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a nice occasion, or everyday travel. They were very helpful when we were looking for things to do around the city too. If you need a nice place to stay that is very accommodating, this is the place. They made us feel so good, we didn't want to leave!\n",

One inconvenience - you cannot bring your car back to the building parking lot past 11 PM if you take it out. They send you to another lot after those hours so do keep this in mind. Very lovely lobby and gracious reception desk. We got a spacious corner king room on the 31st floor with a mini bar, a great view and almost no noise from surrounding rooms. The bathroom was rather large as well. We used the exercise room which was reasonably well equipped. The only complaint I had was that there was no coffeemaker in the room - that would have been nice for first thing in the AM. The hotel is on the far East Side - you will do a lot of walking or using other transportation to pretty much everywhere.

Got the goodie bag upon check-in at midnight, checked out the pillow menu and got a great, very quiet and very clean room.

Tub/Shower combination .There may be larger baths available in the hotel, but I have never had a room with a large bath. amenities are generously sized and are by Gilchrist and Soames.\n",

The bartender not only served it in it's traditional \"Russian copper mug\" but made their own ginger beer. It was truly impressive.

Has a over priced stock refrigerator and snacks (separate from the one they brought up at no charge). The inside from floor 5 and up is stone. The only down side is no amenities besides a average size fitness center. No pool no sauna... parking is $38 a night and takes a little while to get your car. I would recommend this hotel as long as you do not care about the amenities.

The fitness center has a great view as you work out and has up-to-date equipment. My only negative comment is that the valet parking @ $28/day is too expensive, especially when you also wind up tipping the valets every time they retrieve your car. For the budget-minded, the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks away is not as opulent, but is clean and convenient and does have free parking and breakfast.

We had booked a room on the executive level (top floors) which was a great move. It only cost a little bit more, but it is well worth it. There is a separate check in on the top floor with absolutely no wait. We were able to get early check in which was very convienent. The physical hotel itself was nice, nothing outrageous but nice. In the evening they served complimentary appetizers/fresh fruit/etc which were very good and in the mornings you had continental breakfast. When we went to check out the staff kindly offered us a very late check out (5:00 PM rather than noon). This was OUTSTANDING because all I was asking for was to check our bags with the bell desk because our flight was not leaving until the afternoon and our original plan was to do some more sight seeing during the day. It was a very rainy day so without us even asking for it they offered us this late checkout at no extra charge since we would be pretty misarable walking around the city in the rain. The concierge was also EXTREMELY friendly and helpful. This was a perfect stay and would highly recommend and if you do stay here, I would also advise the upgrade to executive level.\n",

I told him that my girlfriends and I were meeting in Charlotte to enjoy life, spend time together, and watch the football game that night on TV (and mentioned we wanted to see Virginia Tech win).

The whole area was spotless, and the attendants were available when needed but not intrusive. (They weren't hovering around the spa area all the time (which can be awkward if one is partially dressed and/or make one feel rushed to leave), but there was always help at available at the very close-by front desk.) When I booked the appointment, the attendant had mistakenly left me on hold for a really long time, so when I checked in, she gave me a small gift to apologize (which was not needed but very kind of her to do).

The bathroom was huge and featured rich marble decor with a shower with a glass door, a tub, and a toilet room. My friends and I felt like celebrities -- it was that VIP. On the desk in the living room area was a bottle of complimentary champagne with a note from Frankie, wishing us well for a fun evening in the hotel and even a \"Go Hokies\" message. Now THAT is how a hotel rocks out the customer service. We felt cared for and important. \n",

      "We ended up having drinks and some light food downstairs at the bar; it was a great scene for people watching and relaxing, and it was pretty hopping even for a weekday (it was Thursday night).

The food there was quite good and service was excellent. \n",

The staff were never too busy to help us and always polite, there was no problems with the lifts, though I can see how there could be if its very busy and you can get to most places on foot or just a short Subway ride.The aircon unit was a little noisy, but worked well as a heater. so overall we have no compliants about our stay and can only assume that the negative feedback on this site, is by people who maybe expect too much for their money, in a major city. The restuarant attached to the hotel was good for breakfast and the owners, Al and his son Vinnie ,offered us a 20% discount on dinner, but we did not have time to take up the offer this trip.

Within the older building are the hotel's 2 restaurants--Ame (dinner) on the first floor and Vitrine (breakfast and lunch) on the 4th--as well as the 2 level spa and offices.

The east facing rooms face the Bay, but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the Financial District.\n",

There were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair, but no chaise lounge or \"fainting chair\" as seen on the hotel web site. There was a large marble window ledge--great for counter space. One wall held the 42\" flat screen TV (which did not swivel) and 3 recessed doors--one was a too small closet (only about 2 feet of space), another held a safe, fax machine (out of ink) and 3 drawers, the third held the minibar and fridge and DVD/CD player. The spacious bath had an enclosed WC, a tub that opened onto the bedroom, a separate shower stall with marble bench, rain head plus hand-held head. There was a 2nd flat screen TV, but only one sink. In the room and bath, there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels.\n",
      "Technological glitches included: 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired (batteries?). With the phone/computer, the party I was speaking to occasionally could not hear me, though I could hear them. The hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when I requested a wake-up call and the operator called twice but could not hear me, so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door. Alas, the phone still was acting up on check out day. \n",
      "Overall service was top notch--quick, courteous and professional--especially the front desk and housekeeping. The problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies. The doormen were not so attentive--often talking with the valets. No one helped me when I walked up with my luggage when first checking in. Some of the concierge staff, while helpful, were a bit aloof. I believe all the St. Regis' offer Butler Service. In New York this is quite formal, but seems less so here. One Butler I spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessional--when she couldn't answer my question, she yelled/asked another employee without putting me on hold, so I could hear every thing.\n",
      "The public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff, and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool, also open 24 hours. The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side. The \"Business Center\" consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators. This may be a temporary location.\n",
      "Regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviews--yes you can hear them, but I imagine the other nearby hotels--W, Four Seasons, Westin, Marriott--can as well.\n",
      "I have stayed at a few other high-end hotels here--the Ritz Carlton, Campton Place, the Palace. I would like to one day try the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental, but for now the St. Regis is my favourite San Francisco hotel.\n",

The hotel was amazing, beautiful architecture, great location (in the mountains), ample pools and hot tubs, excellent service and the room was large and comfortable. The only negative i could find is that there were lots of teenagers and adolescents . The only problem was that they were all in the main pool area, but thankfully there is a pool inside our hotels courtyard.

We had a room with Bay view, I believe almost all rooms do. The inside of the hotel, with it's open lobby and illuminated elevators, is particularly impressive. The staff is great in all respects. When a small package I had ordered hadn't come in with the mail in time before we left, Pepe from the mail room went out of his way to have it forwarded by mail to our next Hyatt stay in San Diego. We didn't even get charged for that allthough I had authorized a charge. We will be back for sure! \n",

We asked for a quiet location and didn't care about a view, and were given room 701, a junior suite that faces the side of the McDonald's building next door. It was well protected from neighboring room noise (it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet) and fairly protected from street noise, but more about that in a minute. The room was very large and clean, the bed and chairs comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people (though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries). The bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan, as it has no vent or window, and a couple of days when I attempted to shower around noon I had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water (this didn't happen when showering earlier). The kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters, as we did not like the in-room Puck's filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee. The Azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar, including items such as stuffed tofu, sesame noodles, and seafood, a hot foods bar, and many essentials such as boxed cereal, baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks, so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner. A table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk, and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both, but we only had the desk.\n",

In fact, the entire hotel is overheated, and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40-degree air at all times, including at night. Fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units, which created a nice white noise for sleeping. Unfortunately, though, the smell of McDonald's often wafted in. A fan-only setting on the heating/AC unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy, but the only option at this time of year was hot air, because the hotel hadn't yet switched over to AC. We're lucky that we didn't arrive later in spring, because I can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there! Also, there were no screens on the windows, so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open.\n",
      "I do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators: Stay on a lower floor and take the stairs! We were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time, though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing, especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats.\n",
      "The second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed, and has two computers with Internet access for guests. The trouble is, there's no regulation of usage, so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other like-minded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends. Her mother finally told her to get off--but then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email! The other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to Flickr, apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs. The staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area.\n",
      "Overall, we would stay there again, but only during the cold season on the quiet side of the building, or during the hot season when the AC is turned on.\n",

There's a really convenient grocery store (D'Agostinos) and wine store just a block away and the nice pantry came in handy for storing fruit & juice for a quick snack in the morning and wine/beer for the late evening after being out all day. We had one dinner at \"Rare\" and the food was well prepared, service was efficient and price was about what one would expect in that locale. The breakfast prices were a bit high so we ate at the Deli down the street and a really nice restaurant under the bridge near Grand Central Station. \"Duke's\" around the corner was also good for an inexpensive dinner. \"Veselka's' was recommended for an authentic Ukrainian meal and it didn't disappoint -------in the East Village and lots of local color, specialites were blintzes, goulash, beef strogonoff, etc. The housekeeping and front desk staff were very pleasant and efficient and we would stay there again in a hearbeat.\n",

      "Text: I've stayed here multiple times and always enjoy my stay. My most recent trip was for the July 4th holiday and I took advantage of their online check-in service for their Select Guests (definitely the way to go) so my keys were waiting for me when I arrived. It's just a few days before my birthday and when I entered the room I had 4 chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champagne and a birthday card signed by numerous staff members waiting for me. That sort of attention to detail and guest loyalty makes the Omni chain one of the best in the country.\n",
      "I've read several reviews where previous guests have commented on the rooms being small and quite honestly this surprises me. The Parker House has been around for over 150 years and prides itself on being historic...I'm not sure how one could expect their rooms to be cavernous in size or ultramodern. Personally, I don't find their room size to be a problem; I'm there to sleep, not travel to Boston and spend the entire time holed up in my guest room. \n",
      "Overall the guest rooms are always clean, the beds are extremely comfortable, the staff is professional and the breakfast is phenomenal. The only two small gripes I had about my stay were there was a large red (wine?) stain on the side of the bed in the room and there was also construction on School St at 6 am which woke me up (I had ear plugs with me and was able to fall right back to sleep).\n",
      "I didn't take advantage of their bars/restaurants on this trip but I have in the past and have always enjoyed the food and service; the Boston Creme Pie is a must have!\n",

Michele at the front desk was a standout and very kind. She took the time to talk to the boys and even had a Wii sent up to the room for them! The next morning she asked them all about the Lion King and made them feel comfortable and welcome. The pool was awesome and the view of The Empire State Building from the pool is great.

It is also located directly across the street from Horton Plaza which houses Nordstrom's, Macy's and many other chain stores.\n",

From the minute I arrived, the valet was ready to assist with my car, as was the bellman which was definitely needed when on the road for two weeks and with three girls traveling this time around - needless to say we had lots of luggage. I was impressed by the friendly and accomodating service right from the start. The lobby was beautiful and screamed relaxing! The check in was flawless and up to the room we went. Fast elevator with a british accent welcomed me to my floor. Opened the door to the room and wow was I and my travel mates impressed. Coffee is a must for me so the first I noticed was the upgraded coffee machine with real mugs and real creamer (not powdered)! The room was furnished lovely - fantastic for us ladies - bright, cheery and in the colour of the season - orange. The room was oversized, extremely clean and exactly what I had hoped for. Need I say, the beds were terrific and rather than enjoying the night out, we decided to stay in! Also loved waking up to the spacious bathroom and huge shower area. We checked out the 9th floor bar as everyone speaks of; enjoyed the view, service and fire box, which kept us warm which made us again think as to whether we should be going out. Wine selection was definitely enjoyed as was again the staff. We did eventually venture out, and found very popular hot spots all within walking distance to the car. Each day we throughly enjoyed mainly because of this fabulous hotel and outstanding service always with a smile and ready to please. Darren at the hotel provided us great tips for places to visit and see, which really made our visit and overall experience. He was as they say the icing on the cake! Sadly our visit had to come to an end, and Im ready to start packing for a new trip. I can only hope that I have the level of service and quality of standards that I experienced at this Indigo...and I can only hope! I wish I was going back to San Diego. What a lovely and fun city!

We realize now that Chicago in general is pricey but that's ok - we never regret money spent on a trip. Speaking of pricey - The cost of the breakfast buffet at the hotel is $23. Per person. We would have liked to have had a usable fridge in the room. The lack of this amenity makes it family UNfriendly. There is no counter space in the bathroom... And speaking of bathrooms...there was a horrible sour smell in there and really bad mildew and mold in the shower on the tile grout. I really needed a bottle of Tilex. Pictures of the recently remodeled rooms are a little deceptive. The rooms look huge in the pics... they are not. Honestly - this Hyatt seems to be more for the business traveler and not so much a family. but believe it or not - because of the location - we would stay there again (I'll just make sure I bring my Tilex).\n",

      "Text: We have just finished a 5 day 4 night stay at the Millennium UN Plaza in New York. The hotel was fantastic. Everything about it was excellent, the service, the cleanliness, the size of the bed and the location for some of the attractions couldn't have been better. I have saved the best to last, if you do get a choice then choose room 3517 on the 35th floor, the view from our window was fantastic. When we first walked into our room we both stood there for a few minutes and couldn't believe it. At night it was even better. I decide to take a swim in the pool that was on the 27th floor, the view which is ranked as 1 of the top 5 pool views in New York, certainly lived up to it. It was totally amazing. We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot say if the food was good, but that was because there was so much to eat and drink locally. All in all if you are looking for a quick break in New York then I couldn't think of a better place to stay than the Millennium UN Plaza. It certainly made our stay in New York a truly magnificent EXPERIENCE.\n",

We were only there for 4 short nights however I would have loved to stay longer. We did manage to spend some time at the family pool where we ordered a wonderful lunch and enjoyed some drinks by the pool. It was a great afternoon for the adults along with the kids who spent the day in the pool playing with some of the pool toys that were provided by the resort. One morning I even had the pleasure of going down to the spa and having a wonderful swedish american massage. And after the massage I spent some time in the steam room... I could have spent all day in the spa but I had to get back to the room to spend some time with the family. On the evening we ate in the Veranda, there was an excellent buffet that was going on so half of our party ate from the buffet and then the rest of us ordered off their menu. Of course, we also made time to eat in El Bizcocho. We didn't bring the kids along since this restauarant is much more of a \"fine dining\" experience. After reading all of the stories about El Bizcocho's chef, we were definitely not disappointed. The food, presentation and service there is absolutely incredible. I can say nothing but good about the Rancho Bernardo Inn - Everyone should experience it.\n",

It is in walking distance of downtown. Across the street from the hotel you have the NCAA national headquarters and the Indiana State Museum. The hotel is brand new and opened in February 2010. It is adjacent to Fairfield Inn and Courtyard By Marriott. All three hotels share an underground garage that sits beneath the hotels. Self parking in the garage is $20/day and valet parking is $25/day. There is a well appointed TGIFriday's located in the Fairfield Inn and you can dine there or have it delivered to your room through room service.\n",
      "The hotel is very well appointed and serves a continental breakfast every morning. Rooms are well appointed and are trendy. Each room has a large Phillips LCD HDTV with plenty of HD channels available. Free internet is available via Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi signal strength is very good and download speeds were 1.5 Mbit consistently. The room has an independently controlled HVAC system with a digital thermostat, microwave, and small cube fridge. The bathroom design is somewhat interesting in that is a split bathroom. The main sink/vanity and tub are in one room and the toilet and small sink are located in another area. The beds were very nice with high quality sheets and coverings. The night stand contained a phone along with an iHome clock radio with iPod Dock.\n",
      "As for other features, a fitness room was available with a variety of equipment available. The hotel features a very small indoor pool that probably could safely fit about 20 people in it. A business center is available where you can check your e-mail and print off boarding passes. The lobby is well appointed with free coffee and wi-fi. The breakfast area was very clean and offered a variety of hot and cold items for breakfast. Typically scrambled eggs and sausage patties were available along with a do-it-yourself waffle machine. A variety of cereals, bagels, and juices were available as well. \n",
      "For dinner, as mentioned previously, a TGIFriday's is located over in the Fairfield Inn. Other restaurants are located in downtown and can be easily accessed by foot, car, or taxi.\n",

The kitchen in my room (as well as the other rooms - I was told by a staff member) do not have measuring cups among a few other kitchen essentials. It wasn't too big of a deal as the wonderful woman (she was a doll and good at her job) who works evenings preparing and serving dinner lent me the hotel kitchen's measuring cup so I could make my rice. The maid service was quite consistent as well, minus the fact that they forgot to replace my kitchen towels and rags; once again, no big deal as I was able to simply use an extra set from the bathroom. Also, I had to ask for additional ice bags for the ice bucket they provide.\n",

Chipped bathroom tiles, queensized sheets on king sized beds leave you fighting with the bottom sheet all night. The lack of bathroom exhaust fans are like being in an unwanted sauna. The ecologically friendly light bulbs hang below the shades, are too big for the lamps and provide a blinding glare when turned on. The bathrooms have dirt rimmed shower doors and dirty grout. When we asked to change rooms we were rebuffed by one Desk Clerk. Finally after much hassle we did switch rooms.

Prior to the visit I had emailed the hotel to ensure we were getting a king bed, as one of our goals was getting a good night sleep (we have a toddler at home and another coming soon). The concierge emailed me back to see if there was anything else they could do to make our stay special. The gesture was much appreciated, as was the upgrade to a suite when we checked in. The room was fantastic, with a large sitting and dining area adjacent to the bedroom and bathroom. The color scheme was white with modern décor, definitely a contrast from other hotels where we’ve stayed in Boston. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very chic. Note that if you are looking to take a bath, you may be out of luck, as our room only had a stand-up shower – not sure if any other rooms have a tub. The room was matched by the food from the restaurant, Woodward. Our quick lunch of squash flatbread and mixed nuts hit the spot, and I sampled some of their funky cocktails (the New Orleans Sazerac is addictive). But we were holding out for breakfast and the hash menu. We had the duck and sweet potato hash and the ham and cheese omelet delivered to the room and it did not disappoint.

      "The room had a wrap-around view as noted, and there was a nice Hudson view from the bathroom as well. Others have commented on the lack of shelf space but this was not a problem for me. There was a mobile etegere for additional storage, which should accommodate most guests' toiletries.\n",

      "Text: In town for a wedding and weary from a day of missed flights from the east coast, our first contact at the Huntington was the professional and friendly doorman and bell staff. Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the \"Big 4\" railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the \"Big Four\" Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a \"special occasion\" venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper. Even as we were leaving at 3:30 am to catch our flight back home!\n",

Guests were given an opportunity to \"Go Green\" by choosing not to have the room made up, and we did take advantage of that option. My only two \"negatives\" were the fact that upon arrival on a Friday afternoon there was no doorman. As my husband unloaded the car, I had to find a luggage cart and manipulate the entrance. The cart was not that easy for me to push, but I needed to do so to clear the doorway. There was no valet parking person around either. It did not seem a very welcome way to enter the hotel. However, the front desk employees were exceptionally friendly, which made up for this first impression. My second 'negative' was the perfume scented spray used in both the rooms and the hallways. It was so overpowering that my eyes were watering. The front desk, with an apology, said that there were no rooms where this spray was not used by the maids. For this reason, the first night and through the next day we needed to keep the sliding glass door partially open to 'air' out the room. It was fine by the middle of the next day.\n",
      "Finally, the hotel is immediately next to the Aquarium and other locations which make the Harbor much fun for tourists.\n",

      "Text: My husband and I have stayed all over the city with our children and without (2 girls 7 & 9). Comparing the Marriott East side to the Hilton on 6th or the W in times square it's easy to give this hotel a rave review. We were just their from Oct 6-9. When we arrive we are always greeting with smiles and hello's. The hotel guest relations coordinator Kenda remembers us everytime we go (about 3 times a year). This particular stay we reserved a Jr Suite with a pull out sofa for our children. When we got to the 6th floor room it smelled of smoke (non-smoking hotel) and the tub was clogged. I called down to the at your service desk and requested a change of rooms due to the fact of an asthmatic child. We were not given the same room but instead the Ambabassador Suite on the 33rd floor. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. My profile with Marriott states that I have an asthmatic child, however I don't feel that this is why I was switched to such a large suite. I believe it is the relations that the staff tries to keep with it's guest. I have never experienced a rude employee at this hotel. Having stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 5 I find that quite amazing. Not sure if everyone knows this, but JW Marriott is the parent company for the Ritz Carlton. As a frequent guest of the Ritz in Boston as well as the Ritz Beach Resort in Naples FL. It is easy to compare this category 7 Marriott to the Ritz. For anyone who expects a LARGE hotel room in NYC should do somemore research, most that I've stayed in have been quite small. I'm sure do to the fact that the city is so populated. Paying over $500 a night was completely fine for what we got (even if our room hadn't changed) Location, just blocks from the best shopping and sites in NYC. The easy highway access and the fact that you are in such a large city and yet at this hotel you get the feel that you are in a neighborhood. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy New York!!!!\n",

Our attendant was very nice, however, we think she may be been in training as we were standing there at the desk for at least 15 minutes - to the point that we asked, \"Is everything all right?\" We had booked a king bed room, and they had us in a double bed room - I believe they upgraded us to the Waldorf Towers (although I don't recognize any of the rooms in which we stayed on the website), but I don't know if we originally had booked in the Towers or the Hotel. We were on the 28th floor.\n",
      "The elevator and hallway were very pretty, I did not notice any signs of aging in the Tower, however, I did notice a smell in the hall - maybe it was a smoking floor? Our room did not smell of smoke. The room itself was very nice - marble floors, separate tub and shower, and a walk-in closet. There was a nice view of Park Avenue and St. Bart's church below. The water pressure was virtually non-existent and when you used the sink, the stopper held the water in the sink. In the shower, it was a tiny bit better. Be careful walking around the room, the bed frame stuck out several inches from the bed, and we banged our shins on it a couple of times.\n",
      "Later, when we went to sleep, we could not figure out how to turn off the light underneath the sink, nor could we determine how to close the opague shades at night, so with the lights from outside, it basically looked like daylight in our room. We were so tired and it was late, so we decided not to call the front desk to have someone come up to the room. The bed was very comfortable.\n",

Nina, the woman on duty, commented on a crown shaped pendant I was wearing. I told her it was a gift from my husband and that I am the queen of our home. She laughed and said that she is the queen of the Lenox. In fact they call her QB (queen bee) for short. We chatted a bit more and my husband and I headed for a quick lunch at her recommendation of Pappa Razzi for some carbo loading. (excellent) We went back to the room and Nina appeared with a basket of goodies (power bars, etc) and a giant helium balloon. It was a bumble bee of course! How special and unbelievable!

We had to walk around the area for an hour or so to kill time when all we wanted to do was get into our rooms and freshen up. I was travelling with my elderly parents (both in their mid 70's) who were exhausted and just wanted to lie down. When we got back to the hotel at 4pm the rooms were STILL not ready. Eventually one room became available and then after 30 minutes of constantly calling reception I finally went down and argued with the desk clerk. I booked this hotel because it had great reviews and is a better class of hotel but wouldn't recommend it if you are looking to get into your room before 5pm in the evening.

Some desk reception people need to be more friendly and helpful. Asked about arranging a broadway show (were not helpful to us) When leaving we asked reception to get us a car to travel to airport - after about 2 hours we got one - never been so frightened in travelling in my life (private hire car and way too fast). Do your own hiring of cars. Also not one person from reception asked if we enjoyed our stay at end of 7 days - Also airconditioning outside motor in next door offices very noisy during week days - ok weekends as is turned off.

I think you have to accept that New York is a noisy city, we were on the 9th floor and you can hear the street noise if you have your window open, with the window closed I had no problems sleeping and our room came with air con to keep us cool. Yes, the doors do slam if you let them, but I cant say that this is a reason not to stay here.\n",

I am not sure if I just got a nice desk clerk or my Hilton Gold HHonors card did the trick, but I was given a room in Tower 1 on the 37th floor, access to the Executive Level, and free breakfast for both days. She even added my HHonors account # to the reservation (which they are not supposed to do for Priceline stays).\n",
      "The room was small, but had a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Everything was clean, but room service was spotty. The first night we received turn down service, but the second night we did not. We were given complimentary waters from the mini-bar, but they never replenished the stock. Everything else was fine with housekeeping.\n",
      "For breakfast we choose the restaurant on the lobby level rather than the continental on the Excecutive Level. The buffet which you may choose instead of a menu item was above-average and opens at 6am. The \"finger foods\" offering on the Executive Level from 5 - 7pm was not as good as the views from that level. Everything tasted like frozen food and the booze was cash bar. Waters and sodas were free and were great to take back to the room for later.\n",
      "I am not sure if access to the Execututive Level is actually controlled because there were a ton of people up there, no checks at the door, and a ton of children. Regardless, it was a nice place to fill up on snacks before heading out to dinner.\n",

      "One disconcerning experience was with the Bell Desk. We needed to pickup our rental car, so we asked to leave our bags for an hour or so after we checked out to save time. We handed over the bags, got our claim tickets and you could tell this guy wanted a tip already. In my experience it is customary to tip after you retrieve your bags, not upon dropping them off. Perhaps the normal business clientel throws around money more than we do, but what did he do for a tip...Put a ticket on my bags?\n",
      "Anyway, after we got the car, we went inside to get the bags, gave our tickets and requested a cart. This same guy points to our bags, say get them yourself and told us to put them on the cart. At this point, another person at the Bell Desk offered to help; he took the bags to the car and put them in the trunk for us. He got the tip, not the grinch who told us to do it ourselves.\n",

For those of you who have spent time in Manhattan, this is not an issue. For those of you from small towns, I guess it can be unpleasant. Although I was unphased by homeless, there appears to be a large population of mentally ill, homeless people evidenced by screaming, talking to themselves, and in one case, a nude woman all within walking distance of the Hotel (Right across from Hotel Adagio and Cortez restaurant).\n",
      "Every city has homeless, so if it really bothers you perhaps you should not walk around at night? One reviewer suggested giving the homeless money. I am not sure I agree with this and many expect more if you give a little. Again, that comes from growing up around Manhattan. To each their own I guess.\n",
      "One thing I am sure of is that you should not let a few homeless citizens take away from the otherwise great loaction of this hotel. A few blocks from BART, major bus stop hubs, streetcars and trolleys. I recommend this for your first stay in San Francisco since it really is at the center of it all.\n",

The staff were very friendly by NY standards, the room was impeccably clean and nicely appointed, and the view was spectacular. Even better, the windows open (rare in NYC), so you can snap pictures of the city without an obstructing window. This hotel is just off the Times Square crossroads, and is actually quite peaceful and quiet. If you're a Hilton Honors Silver member you can check in early and check out late. Great hotel!\n",

Location is excellent, within walking distance to shopping, Times Square theatres, Rockefeller Center, and several subway stops. We were able to check in at 12:00 noon which is uncommon for NYC. Room was what we requested meeting all our needs including two double beds. Rooms with two beds are difficult to come by in NYC. Our room was large enough to accomodate the beds and leave room for living. In fact the room was large by New York standards. Staff was very helpful. Great concierge service, brilliant doormen, and most importantly they allowed a late check out of 2:00 pm on Sunday! This was truly appreciated. Only disappointment was the bathroom. It could use more space and room to store your \"bathroom items\". The hotel provided a quiet, unhurried place to rest and return to everyday.

It wasn't a major additional expense--just over ten dollars, but I am on a budget and would at least have liked to be aware of this. But I was given free internet access and they comped my toothbrush ($15~!) from the honor bar so it evened out. Also there is an almost $20 per day city tax I was unaware of. Other than that we LOVED our stay--every person we encountered was nice and helpful, my dog got a bed she loved, I had more pillows than I knew what to do with and even ordered an additional one from their pillow menu (as well as Tao te Ching from the spiritual menu). Overall a great experience, even if it was a bit more expensive than I'd planned on. Thank you!\n",

      "Text: I had a free night at any Hyatt from a promotion during the spring, so I used it for a one-night stay on a college visit to Chicago with my teenage son. We were able to confirm only a two twin bed room, but were advised to request two doubles at check-in. We arrived early around 9am, expecting to check our luggage. Despite being sold out on doubles, they checked for two rooms, both with doubles, and said we could check in soon. After about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby; when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready. We went to the room, which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan down the street. Two double beds, a huge bathroom with two sinks, a separate toilet room, an oversized bathtub with a hand-held shower head, and a separate shower room with a rain-type wall mounted shower about 8' up and a separate hand-held. The door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed. I couldn't believe that we had been given a two-room suite, so I called the front desk to check. I was put on hold but got no response so I called back after a few minutes. They first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room, but when I explained that I was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that I had reserved only one room. I locked the connecting doors myself.\n",
      "The room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting. Flat screen TV, i-pod dock, one robe (but two pairs of slippers) in the closet, two toothbrushes and toothpaste, iron, ironing board, shoeshine machine, hairdryer, safe, etc. Minibar, jars of nuts (3 kinds), bottles of imported sparking water, basket of apples. I assume that only the apples were complimentary though. (the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turn-down service -- I guess they really wanted us to buy them.) Extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each, a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman, glass desk with chair, and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate. Complimentary internet access -- wired and wireless, although the latter worked for my son, it didn't for me, There was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked \"internet cable\" in one of the drawers.\n",
      "We checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel. I asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure, no problem. We didn't need to keep our keys because there was open access. We returned around 4:30 pm and went to the pool. Locker room had full-sized lockers stocked with robes and slippers; towels were piles on a rack. Keys were in the unused lockers. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, shaving cream, razors, etc. all available. Two shower rooms, one equipped for handicapped. Large steam room. Three or four lane lap pool, with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters. Small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day. We went to the airport and arrived home late, tired and relaxed. Our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip.\n",
      "I didn't rate value because our room was complimentary. We really appreciated not being treated like second class citizens in any way -- the service was first rate from everyone we encountered. My only two admittedly minor suggestions would be to replace the towels with more fluffy ones -- the ones we had were somewhat thin -- and to add a mirror in the bedroom -- the only mirrors were in the bathroom.\n",

      "Text: Although there are many hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, we chose this hotel because we really like the Holiday Inn Express chain and have stayed in many throughout the US. Besides the great location, I guess the biggest draw would be their incredible free breakfast - not just the standard cereals, but scrambed eggs, bacon, etc. Considering we found the restaurants in the area to be fairly expensive, this was definitely a money saver and a nice way to start the day. As to be expected, though, the eating area was always very crowded. Our mini-suite was somewhat disappointing, rather small, compared to others in the Express chain we've stayed at. At night the room was quiet even though the daytime traffic was noisy. Service was friendly. All in all, a very nice hotel. A tip for riding the cable car at the turnaround near the hotel - we went later on in the day and there was hardly a wait. Also, we'd recommend the Night Tour at Alcatraz. Booking online well in advance is a real convenience.\n",

They were kind enough to call their sister hotel, the Sleep Inn, only a block away and got a room for us.

The trolley stopped behind our hotel and we loved riding down to Beale St and sight seeing on the trolley. We were within walking distance to a great cafe recommended by the staff, the Blue Plate, and enjoyed breakfast there instead of the continental at the hotel. This hotel is newly renovated and is awesome. The staff was wonderful too. We got our room for $99 and it was comparable to the $149 room we stayed in at a new Hampton in Wisconsin last year. This was our first stay at a Sleep Inn but it won't be our last. We booked while we were there for the BBQ festival in May.

I'd guess that the last serious renovation of bathrooms was in the late 80s. The A/C wasn't great, it got cool enough but we could never seem to get the dampness totally out of the air. It's central air but I don't think the dials in the room actually control the temp other than the speed of the fan. This is our second stay here in 3 years and we were realistic about it so none of that really bothered us. We slept fine, although the bed was a little soft for my taste.

It's just a very nice feeling to arrive at the Waldorf when checking in and for the money, it can be a very good value and here's why: This hotel does run specials quite often and you can actually get rooms here for around $200, a special which can occur more often than you think, especially if you book early. A very good bargain, considering a plain Manhattan Holiday Inn can be over $200. I payed $159 for the Sunday night I stayed on the 19th of December and I booked directly through the hotel's website. I was very happy about this bargain.\n",
      "I checked in at around 1:40 PM and it was easy and not a problem. The hotel staff is very good and friendly. Nice vibe I got from them. My room was very nice, actually spacious(seemed a little bigger than the standard rooms at the Plaza hotel) and comfortable. While the bathroom is small, it is very nice with marble. You'll get bigger bathrooms at the Ritz Carlton hotel but you'll also be paying over $400 a night there too. The bed in my room was wondeful, great down pillows and it was so comfortable to sleep on. \n",
      "You might wanna be careful about room service. It's insanely expensive. I ordered an apple pie and it was around $17! Even though room service is generally expensive at hotels, I only order it at special hotels that I like because it does feel good to get the service there. I wouldn't order room service at a typical Hilton hotel so the high price at the Waldorf was worth it. It's like, hey I'm getting room service at the freaking Waldorf baby! So that's how I rationalize it and I'll pay the higher price because it's like once in a life time that I'll probably do this, Ya know. So why not live the life for a few extra dollars more!\n",
      "Anway, the Waldorf has a pricy steakhouse called the Bull and Bear and I have to say that the steaks are outstanding! It was the best steak that I've ever had. I can honestly say this because I've eaten at many steak houses. I'm not saying that it's the best steak in New York but the standards are high at this joint. Side dishes were very good too. Very nice bartenders there too. Be sure to tip them well if they give you good service. I'll definetly be back for dinner on my next trip to New York City.\n",
      "In the lobby, there is a piano and it's actually a historic relic. It's the piano that was owned by Cole Porter who lived in the Waldorf. He's a famous jazz song writer and on the weekends, there is someone playing it for the crowd in the lobby and you can even order drinks there too. Very nice, especially hearing a piano that is a part of music history. Porter wrote many songs on that piano too. Just a little bit of trivial info about the Waldorf lobby.\n",
      "Checking out was very easy and lastly, one odd thing that I want to mention. I know it's a bit strange but when I come to New York, I like to bring my bike. I prefer this mode of transportation instead of cabs and public transportation. Anyway, the hotel let me store my bike for free in their parking garage! They actually have a bike rack where you can chain your bike. It was a nice feeling to know that my bike was safe in the hotel's garage. Usually I chain it to a pole on the street. All in all, I'm glad I stayed to stay at the Waldorf. It has comfortable and homey!\n",

They offered free and it was very reliable shuttle to and from the airport. The free breakfast was amazing. Pancakes, sausage and biscuits, yougurt, cereal and breads along with coffee and juice. The rooms were small but just right. There was a large fridge and microwave and coffee pot. The beds were sooo comfortable. The only bummer was we had to go outside across an enclosed patio to get to the main building. Price was perfect!! We have stayed at nicer hotels but this was the best value!!!\n",

She offered me a price better than I had found anywhere on line including priceline, etc. She was very helpful. This even allowed me to get Starwood points. Once we got to the hotel everyone was very helpful and extremely nice. My only recommendations would be that they provide more information on city tours, maps, locations of sites, and transportation information. You had to ask the concierge about everything and sometimes they were a little short. Otherwise though a very enjoyable experience. The hotel is in a great part of town and we felt safe the entire time.\n",

I have also never written a negative review, but felt that our experience warranted it. When we arrived, the two double beds that I had reserved were not available and we three adults were placed in a King room. My daughter slept on the sleep sofa, which is probably fine for children, but was very uncomfortable for her, resulting in complaints of back pain throughout the trip. \n",
      "The room itself was fairly clean, but lots of candy wrappers under the sleep sofa, plaster bits around on the rug in both rooms, and some kind of splatter on the walls and lampshade of the main sitting room.

Little things, but felt like I was in a slum. \n",
      " Although we had reserved and paid for three adults, the room was set up for two so we had to seek out glasses and towels each day. The breakfast hosts on all mornings were short tempered (and appeared to be overworked.) The buffet itself could have been ok, but the kitchen obviously had difficulty keeping up with the demand. We waited about 45 minutes for just some oatmeal one morning, and finally gave up and left to buy breakfast elsewhere. There was plenty of bread for toast, cold cereal, muffins, but hard to get healthier options like bagels, fresh fruit, or hot cereal. Coffee ran out 3/3 mornings also. On the mornings that we had a little extra time, we waited but were still not able to get our simple preferences. On the morning that we had to be out by a designated time, we settled for dry cereal and toast. \n",
      "The hotel was very busy and the staff was generally courteous, although if we mentioned any of our concerns, the response was \" We have a large group here today.\" Evidently it was so busy that we often waited 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator up and a couple of times chose to walk down rather than wait. Additionally, the air conditioner/heat unit was incredibly loud, so we had to turn it on for a while, shut it off to sleep, wake up hot, turn it on to cool, then off to sleep. At check out, we were charged for an extra night of parking and after waiting for breakfast, found it irritating to have to wait to resolve the overcharge. We did stop a the manager's reception one night where they served unlimited drinks, potato chips and bags of chex mix. It was nice, although a couple of free drinks and chips certainly does not make up for the inconveniences. The only saving grace for us for this facility was that the location is very good.\n",

The room on the 7th floor contained a king-size bed, flat-screen TV (which only got a few channels and even those were fuzzy), and all the stuff you expect these days in a mid-range hotel. The decor was basically modern Japan, with some unusual touches, like the mural depicting a monster (not Godzilla) attacking Tokyo, and a large photograph of a woman's eye. Even with the artwork the room was extremely comfortable, and I knew right away I would enjoy a good night's sleep. The location was so quiet I could have easily kept the window open all night, weather permitting. For a little over $100 this was an incredible bargain for a room of this quality in San Francisco. I parked overnight at the nearby Japan Center for $15, still a great deal. This neighborhood is packed with great restaurants. Between Japan Center and the restaurants along Fillmore you've easily got a week's worth of great dining, all within a five minute walk. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting SF: business travellers, families, honeymooners, anybody. The unique decor (and the low rates) should appeal to anyone.\n",

I ended up doing a day trip to Napa on my own (rented car from Walnut Creek's Enterprise) and that was lovely.

      "Location: Very convenient to the Southfield and I-94 freeways. Numerous restaurants near the hotel. There is a Chilis and Wendy's within walking distance, right across from the hotel parking lot. It was only a 10 minute drive from DTW. The hotel does not have a free shuttle. \n",
      "Room: As a HHonors Diamond member, I was upgraded to a king bed suite. The room was very nice and included a whirlpool tub. All the furnishings and tvs were new, along with the Sweet Dreams bed. The only complaint about the room was that the A/C was very noisy. Wireless internet access was very reliable and fast .. it is free for Diamond members. It is quite a walk from the front desk to the room, as you have to pass a massive lobby and meeting rooms just to get to the elevators. However, the hotel offers many entrances. To get to your room, you need to enter your key card in the elevator .. a nice safety feature.\n",
      "Food: Ordered room service for breakfast. Was prompt, but for some reason it was cold. Could have been better. The restaurant looked nice, but did not get to visit it.\n",
      "Atmosphere: Lobby was extremely spacious with small waterfall and many tables and couches. However, the hallways leading to the rooms were dark .. there were not many people staying at the hotel (probably because over a holiday weekend) and thus it had sort of a \"cold\" / deserted feel to it.\n",
      "Pool: Did not get to use it, but it looked nice. \n",

      "OTHER TIPS\n",
      "Go up to the 55th floor and look out at the view- its so great, but just dont go into the suites! And if your not so adverturous go down onto the 54th floor and take a look from there. The pool is least busyiest at around 6:30 to 7 PM because closing time is 10 most people like to go for a late dip, and going just that bit earlier means that everyone else will be eating their dinner. Take a look at the flag next to the Concierge bit on the ground floor it has an interesting history to it!\n",

The \"heavenly\" beds were very comfy and the view was great looking out across Lake Michigan. I'd have to say the only downside to this hotel is the fact that they were in the middle of renovations during my stay and we had to \"pardon the dust\"....I understood. Hey, they have to upgrade at some point, right?? And the weirdest thing would have to be when we came back at about 2 AM after the wedding we attended was over, we pulled up and to find the lobby has been transformed into a nightclub. I thought this was very interesting except for the fact that there was about 10 people laying down outside and they were clearly inebriated and ready to puke. I mentioned to my brother that if we were just arriving for the first time right then, I would've been very turned off that such a high class hotel turns into a pukefest nightclub.

The hotel itself is fantastic especially the beds and pillows, we would love to know the make of the beds and pillows which are in the hotel as we did not have one bad night sleep or wake up with any pains after all the walking that we were doing between sightseeing and also on the day of the earthquake we had to walk from Union Station to the Hotel. The hotel should be compliemented on all their services which they provide, especially the cleanliness of all the areas within the hotel. Tour bus tickets can be bought in the hotel and stops right outside the hotel which is even better. We would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Washington and the Metro is not to far away for anyone not wanting the tour bus but this is a perfect way to see Washington.\n",

We arrived around 8 am because we could not stay in the previous hotel any longer and the front desk got us checked in and to our rooms in just a few moments. The room was also very comfortable and there was plenty or room for the four large pieces of luggage we brought. There were a few small issues 1. I requested another blanket and called several times but never received the blanket. The next morning I went to the front desk and let them know that I needed a blanket for that evening and it was taken care of. 2. My rate included a daily coffee card, subway card, movie and mini bar credit. I had to visit the desk three times to get this included value, including the morning I check out to remove the mini bar charges. 3. the afternoon before check out the next morning, we called about weighing our luggage and were told not a problem just bring it down to the business center. So at 5:30 pm we go down to the business center with four large bags wait inside the business center that appears to be closed until someone from the front desk finally comes over to ask if they can help. She offers to find us some help. In the meantime (5:45 pm) the gentleman that actually works in the business center appears and says he is closing at 6:00 pm and does not have time to weigh our luggage that will take all of 30 seconds. So we ask him to get us someone willing to help. He sighs and gets the scale. Overall this hotel is really a good hotel that could be great with just a little customer service and pride from the staff.\n",

      "Text: We spent 11 nights at the Ocean Park Inn and enjoyed every one of them! Yes, there is construction going on in the hotel (they are replacing balcony decks and railings and air conditioners) and next door to it (they are rebuilding the lifeguard tower). We didn't find either project to be excessively noisy, in fact many rooms were closed so the hotel was quieter than it might have been and the flow on the boardwalk was interrupted so it was quieter as well. This hotel was somewhat removed from the \"party\" section of the beach which was great for our family, we only had to walk out our the secure hotel gate and a few feet down the boardwalk to reach the stairs to the beach. The room was very clean, the bathroom somewhat dated but large and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was great as well and they do now offer cream cheese with the bagels. The building is of wood construction so there is some sound transference, we could hear water running and loud discussions if they took place in the bathroom. Most of noise we heard was created by incredibly rude people who felt that having loud discussions in the hallway or letting their kids play soccer there was perfectly acceptable! They rank right up there with the ones who bypassed the handy outdoor shower and went straight into the pool or their rooms, sand and all. The pool was nicely warm and cleaned regularly. There are lots of restaruants nearby, our favorites were Taylor's (right next door) and Joe's Crab Shack (a few doors down). It was easy to drive to the attractions we wanted to see, Sea World was about a 10 minute drive away. Our view was overlooking a very old motel, however we could see the ocean and it was quiet. Our only issue with this hotel is that although it is a totally non-smoking hotel, they allow people to smoke on the balcony with the door closed. As a result we were treated to flicked ashes and the smell of cigarettes on several occasions.\n",

I couldn't imagine a hotel being any better than the many thousands of hotels we've already stayed in. I was a flight attendant for over 8 years and felt that if you stayed in one, you stayed in them all. Boy was I surprised. From the moment we pulled up to the hotel, I could tell things we were different. Once we stepped into the lobby, I noticed how upscale the atmosphere was. Surprisingly though, the staff and service was very warm. When I walked into our room, \"That's Entertainment\" concept suite, my mouth dropped. Our room was gorgeous and I loved the theme. The Monarch restaurant was outstanding. The chef came out and spoke to me because I requested to alter a dish. He wanted to talk to me on how he could make my dish taste great with some other ideas on my request. My husband and I were supposed to go out to a club later that night, but we had such a good time at the restaurant, we stayed there all night and partied. We were treated like royalty our entire stay, all the way to the last moment of our stay when a staff member opened my car door for me and gave me a bottle of water.

This is a historical experience within a hotel setting. Nice artwork all through the hotel and hallways. We booked the Queen/Queen with window because of the small room factor. Yes, its small but it was clean, cozy and quiet. The beds are so comfortable so much so the middle rod supporting it popped out while we were asleep. The sound woke us up. We laughed, thought about the ghost stories,rolled over and went back to sleep. The bed was still comfortable. 82yr old Mom said \"I had the best sleep\" and she has a pillowtop at home. Our bathroom was large enough to accomodate a wheelchair if necessary, had good lighting, upscale natural products, extra soft towels and they provided a makeup mirror in the bedroom if you needed it. We could adjust the temp of the room. We were in Rm 909 facing out 7th street because we were traveling with my elderly Mom and needed a quiet place. The size of the room helped us out, she didn't feel scared or intimidated when we left her for the concert that evening The staff was great very professional not snobbish. They didn't make me feel out of place and I appreciate that as I was worried about this. I've traveled in and out of country and that has been a sad issue at some hotels that think snobbishness = class. We felt welcomed from the moment we got out of the car to go into the hotel. I was happy to see people of all races/ages enjoying themselves in the piano bar and lobbies for the holidays.They had the largest Christmas tree I've ever seen beautifully decorated. 6th street is youthful too cool. Had to ignore only 1 persistent young panhandler. Felt it wouldn't be a safe idea to show financial compassion so many down. I prayed instead. Music everywhere. After partying I stayed up and read sitting on this wonderful highback chair. State Capitol few blocks over. Good mix of youth and history. Delicious bakery and coffee.

Also the breakfast was great, but only enjoyed it because we got it for free when we booked the hotel. If you have to pay for it then it is not worth it. Can be very expensive.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Have to pay for internet. You could go to 16 street mall to barnes and noble for free wifi, but that can be annoying. Although the worst part of all during my stay was how you can hear everything from your room. Now I understand the hotel can not help this issue, but be mindful when you book a room at this hotel. Request a room that is not connected, unless your staying with a group of people. The problem is you can basically hear everything in the room next door. Not fun when you are trying to sleep at 12:00 in the morning and it literally feels that the people next store are in your room. However, when I complained about the noise the staff was more than accomodating to help, which was really nice and appreciated. Also if you’re staying here it is not really a hotel to stay for leisure because whenever there is a convention going on those people (i.e. the shriners) take over the hotel, which can be annoying at times.\n",

There might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning. I also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise.

I spent only one night here and ate elsewhere but this oozes old fashioned quite comfort. The car is whiskd away by Valet's when you arrive and that sets the tone. Everything in the bedrooms is of a very high standard and everything works as it should. the wifi is not complimentary which should be a given at this level.\n",

      "Text: We decided to get away for one night due to a canceled family event in California--so we took a short road trip from home in the Milwaukee area to Chicago to see a show and stay over. We heard the James was the hot set-up right now. so we thought we would try it out for a night. We booked on their website which worked fair. I called to confirm on the phone just to be sure and they were very professsional. I asked if they had a fitness facility and they said yes they had a big one. I asked about spa services and they said they could arrange them. My impression was this was going to be a very luxurious experience--and all for $209--not bad. We arrived there and a person helped us with our luggage from the trunk of the car--I gave him a tip but he didn't do much--I thought he would take us to the room--he just rolled the suitcases a few feet from the car to the front desk and left. We were going to a theater at Watertower but the concierge had no idea how to precisely direct us to the door of the theater since Watertower is a big complex. The hotel building is an older Holiday Inn style high rise with small elevators, halls and doorways. The standard room is tiny and there are no mirrors in the main room so if someone is in the bathroom there are no mirrors for the other person. The bathroom is remodelled but the original tub is there only repainted. The bathroom door slides back and forth but it was off the track and didn't slide smoothly. It turns out there was no spa--it was off site, a major disappointment, as we had hoped to book a massage and facial. The fitness facility stairs were closed off with plastic so you had to take the back receiving area, metal service stairs past the garbage smelling kitchen and enter it the back way into a dungeon-like basement area. There were foam cups and a pitcher of water, but the pitcher was empty except for ice. They offered passes for an outside club called Crunch, but this was several cold blocks away also in a basement. There was no supervision in the fitness room, and the one guest working out at the time was blaring one of the ceiling mounted TVs in the room with ESPN, even though his treadmill had its own TV with a headphone jack. The guest would not give the courtesy of turning it down, so you couldn't use your iPod becausee you coudn't hear it over the ceiling hung TV. We ate at the hotel's Primehouse which was excellent. Figure at least $75 per person. In conclusion we thought during that initial call to confirm the reservation they should have told us clearly about the lack of on-premise spa and the workout room construction. I mentioned this at checkout and received $50 off. Yes, the plasma TV was amazing, but all in all I would recommend the Omni for the same price range, and althought we like to try new things, this, like the W Chicago Lakeshore still has the bones of a 1960's Holiday/Day's Inn and you can't cover this up no matter how hard you try. This was not a luxury experience by any stretch.\n",

      "Text: Most of the basics are there, comfortable bed/bedding, good plumbing, acceptable service attitude, and rooms that have aged relatively well. The confirmed Gold Passport Diamond upgrade landed us a Park Executive Suite or at least that was what the front desk agent called it. The 1-BR suite was spacious and contained 1.5 baths, a long sofa, and a square living room table in lieu of a more traditional work desk (no work surface in the bedroom). We took advantage of the loaner bicycles at the concierge. For the cost conscious, the valet parking is $48 per night. Perhaps a way to describe the property location would be ‘near the center of everything, but close to nothing’, except for the independent cinemas on the back side of the hotel, but not a big deal if you are planning to drive everywhere as we were. While I would rate this property ahead of The Williard, in comparison to Park Hyatts in Asia, this location falls way short.\n",

      "Text: Stayed for six nights in December and I'm looking forward to being able to stay again.\n",
      "For those who can't be bothered to read long reviews, my summary:\n",
      "- Great sleep (quiet and comfortable)\n",
      "- Characterful and friendly\n",
      "- Good price\n",
      "- Good location\n",
      "- Don't eat the carrots\n",
      "For those with more time on their hands:\n",
      "How very, very nice it was to stay in a hotel with some character, rather than the bland formula of an hotel like a Hya-lto-rriott. I found the general feel of the Omni very comforting - like they've been taking care of important people for years and I was in good hands. I might not be considered that important by many other people - but they appeared to find me so, and I enjoyed going along with it.\n",
      "A huge positive point for me was the fact that I slept like a baby. Like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room, in fact. This hotel is made out of good, solid materials, not the usual plasterboard and echo-ey corridors of an ant hotel. I wasn't once kept awake by frisky neighbours, or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms. Good sleep = good mood and good work.\n",
      "In comparison to other business district hotels I found it very reasonably priced. I loved the morning delivery of coffee and juice that was included as part of their rewards programme. Oh, how such small things make such a difference to the way you start your day.\n",
      "Other than that ... friendly, helpful staff and great location for the business district. Although it's a little way from the tourist hotspots, it's no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport ... or, (heaven forbid) use your legs!\n",
      "The one and only issue I stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant - so maybe it's not that fair to post here ... but since the restuarant is affiliated, and there's a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it, I will!\n",
      "The issue? The gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate, reclining in its self-satisfied way against my mightily over-priced and, presumably, very embarrassed steak.\n",
      "That long, lone carrot was, quite honestly, the most revolting vegetable I've ever eaten - and that includes the times I've accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery (food of the devil) in a salad. I can't believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere.\n",
      "If you're a beef aficionado - or even just someone who likes good food - just don't bother. Yes, the steak tasted good ... but not an eye-rolling, conversation-stopping, stress-sapping, umami-ridden explosion of great that I'd expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef.\n",

This was from recommendations by previous Trip Advisor Travellers. We were told by the hotel that they could not guarantee this as the hotel was fully booked. However on arrival we were taken to Room 2904 and we were not to be disappointed. We had one of the most spectacular views that i have ever seen The Chrysler Building and Midtown New York lit up in all its glory. A magnificent sight to go to bed to at night. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were professional and courteous. They even have a pillow menu 5 different types of pillow from soft to hard never had that in a hotel before. The hotel is only 4 blocks from The Empire State Building about 5 to 10 minute walk. About 15 minute walk to Macys and 20 minutes to Times Square/ Broadway. Contrary to reports before we went we found taxis to be clean quick and reasonably cheap. We used one from JFK to our hotel it was cheaper than the train (4 of us were travelling ) 45 dollars which is the standard rate to anywhere in Manhatten plus a 4 dollars 95 cents payment for a bridge toll. A deli that i can recommend for breakfast is Cafe Metro great value and everything cooked fresh and to order in front of you. It is on the corner of 370 Lexington 41st a great start to the day. And anybody wanting a great steak try Juniors at 1515 Broadway and 45th street a famous New York Steak house we had a 20 oz Sirloin with all the trimmings.\n",

Shortly after arrival I received a call from the front desk that my car wouldn't start and couldn't be moved to valet parking. Several of the staff came out and we all tried to figure out what was wrong. This was of course well after closing of repair shops but they helped us find numbers for AAA and for a local dealer and made what could have been a crummy situation as easy as possible. I feel that they went above and beyond the call of duty and can say that the rooms and amenities in the rooms were in line with this assessment as well. Good size rooms for the city and very comfy beds and the bathroom is bigger than the one in my home. So, I will absolutely stay there again.\n",

Check-in was quick and efficient by a friendly gentleman. The hotel features smart elevators that cuts your elevator wait time in half which is nice.\n",

From the 10th floor we also had a nice view of the Washington Monument, our main reason for the visit. We found the room to be exceptionally clean and reasonably spacious for a DC hotel. The corner window was a neat touch that a lot of the rooms had. The bed linens were of high quality and very comfortable. We had also requested a rollaway and it was placed in our room while were away. It was much nicer than normal which was nice.\n",

About the only amenity I could have wished for, however, was an in-room coffee maker, just to get me on my feet. There was simple coffee in the lobby and all kinds of stuff in the fridge, but if I had felt better, we would have picked up a cup and carb at one of the nearby patisseries to carry back to the suite.

There is a radio and TV station across the street so you can watch and listen to the news unfold, if you like. There is shopping the next several blocks that is great. There is also the train loop, right out the front door. Great for getting around but very noisy and dirty.\n",
      "I thought the room was fine...average. We didn't have a corner room with large windows, etc. The view was an office building across the street. \n",

I did use the business center once and it was very nice but also expensive to print. For some reason our cell phone service was terrible in the room. The beds were comfortable, not bad but not great.\n",
      "The bathroom was clean and large. The sink was different, as some have stated on here. Not something I would want at home but cool for the weekend. The door to the bathroom was a large sliding door that didn't close all the way and was really heavy and hard to handle. It was weird.\n",

      "I didn't hear crickets or other noises that people have talked about in the halls.\n",
      "In the evenings it was crazy. You had to show your room key to get into the lobby. There was a guard at the front door. People were lined up outside for the entrance to the rooftop bar and guests were lined up inside. An elevator was dedicated to the bar and roped off. It made the small lobby even crazier and louder. Elevator service was slower. The elevators have a security measure where you need to use your key to access the guest floors but some guests don't get the concept so it was even crazier and slower.\n",

Later that evening we had a phonecall telling us that we could stay in the one room suite. We were very happy as it had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The suite was very comfortable, two decent sized rooms and a kitchenette also three phones, two televisions and two bathrooms.

      "The only negative was the noise from the building site across the road (on 31st street.) We were on the 16th floor, but could still hear when the builders started (at 7am!). The building site was next to a church (which rang it's bells daily at 7am), and opposite that was the famous fire station which was on the go a lot of the time. I think that the noise would be most noticeable on the north and east sides of the hotel (we faced east), and you might be better on the south or west sides of the hotel if it bothers you. They are still refurbishing, and you enter the hotel via the 31st Street entrance, but this is not a problem as there are plenty of porters to move your bags for you. The refurbishing was not a problem at all. No noise or hassle.\n",

      "Text: Staying in a downtown Boston hotel was an interesting first-time experience for us, seeing as we lived for 25 years less than a mile away from the Back Bay Hilton and still consider ourselves locals. This property is perfectly located in close proximity to many of Boston's cultural, dining, and shopping venues, and was for us a perfect home away from home.\n",
      "Commercial property available for new hotel construction has been virtually non-existent in Boston's congested downtown and Back Bay areas for decades. This would explain why the Hilton, a relatively recent arrival to the Boston hotel scene, is appreciably smaller than, for example, the much larger and older Sheraton directly across the street, which has the advantages and disadvantages of being integrated into the Hynes Convention Center and Prudential Center complexes. The Hilton, on the other hand, has a very small triangular footprint on a tiny lot and is only 26 stories tall; this gives it the unexpected and highly welcome ambience of a European-style boutique hotel rather than a big-city American commercial property.\n",
      "The feel of a boutique hotel was reinforced by the front desk staff, housekeeping staff, and other lobby service personnel, who were all extremely friendly, efficient, helpful, and solicitous, almost to a fault. We were greeted by one or more staff members each time we passed through the lobby. This level of personalized service is quite remarkable, even by high Hilton corporate standards, and especially so for this city. Bostonians in general have a well-earned reputation for being rather unfriendly and xenophobic; the thought idly occurred to me that perhaps all of the Hilton's staff had been recruited from non-natives imported from elsewhere.\n",
      "The room rates and parking fees are rather steep, as is normal for big-city hotels. The adjacent parking garage was well-maintained and convenient to the lobby. As Hilton Gold members. we were given a free upgrade to a corner room, which is somewhat larger, asymmetrical, and appreciably less claustrophobic than the standard rectilinear rooms. Our room seemed to have been recently rehabbed and was nicely decorated and well-equipped, including a large flat screen HDTV with a generous assortment of digital channels.\n",
      "The free breakfast served in the executive lounge was somewhat more limited in selection but far higher in quality and freshness than the standard breakfast fare served in Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns in the Hilton family - in fact, it was much better than the restaurants in most Hilton hotels as well. We plan to give their adjacent 40 Dalton restaurant, which shares a common kitchen, a try on our next stay. All in all, this was one of the most satisfying and rewarding Hilton experiences we have had in recent years. To find this extremely high level of guest accommodations and service in our former home city was as astonishing as it was unexpected.\n",

After reading several very good reviews and then seeing the room rate on Expedia (almost half of the what other hotels were charging), I thought something isn’t right here. I continued to go back and forth but then finally pushed the button and booked the room. Initially my son was not going with me on this trip. It was a few weeks later when he decided to join me. So I contacted the hotel to see if I could get a roll-a-away bed in the room. I received the nicest email back from Patrick Donovan, Hotel George‘s Asst. Front Office Manager who took care of that for me and then later sent another email that they had an opening in a better room and moved me there at no extra charge to me. Very nice!\n",
      "Upon my arrival the hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating. It gave me the feeling that I was among friends. Already, this trip was off to a great start.\n",

Also, a couple of gifts that they specifically chose with Alex’s age and new driver status in mind. Outstanding!\n",
      "We had not eaten for some time at that point and couldn’t believe our eyes…there were wonderful treats on the desk for us as well.\n",
      "Fruit and Cheese Plate, Hotel George\n",
      "This was a first for me and the many hotels I’ve stayed in around the country (Travel several times per year and usually stay in Expedia rated 3 and 4 star hotels 5 being highest based on room rates, services offered, etc.). A very nice note from Jasmine Ward, Guest Services Agent for the hotel, accompanied the gifts and food. We also received a call from the front desk checking to see if the room was suitable and if we needed anything else. Wow! I told Alex I’d like to pack this hotel and take it with us.\n",
      "The bathroom was simply beautiful. It had marble tile flooring, a stand alone shower and the bath tub had the handles on the side which was a nice touch. The vanity had my favorite feature…the makeup mirror with magnifier – awesome! Lots of little extras too. The shower also had its own set of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner.

Also, I have to add, it wasn’t just the arrival and such that the Hotel George staff were so thoughtful, friendly and helpful, it was through out my entire stay. I met up in DC with a larger group (12 of us) and we had a tight schedule. Locating family friendly restaurants in DC that have entres under $10 and can accommodate our group on short notice was a bit of a trick. On Sunday night @ 9:30 we were looking for a restaurant like I described. We had just finished up with our last function and had not had time to eat since noon. We drove up to the hotel and the gentleman behind the desk, quickly made a recommendation, placed the call and made reservations for our group that were waiting in their cars out front.

I put it off as long as I could…not having the energy to get up and go find the business center. Finally, I called to ask where to go in hotel for such. Michael Love, the Hotel George, Front Office Manager, again almost read my mind. He offered to take care of this for me and just slide the passes under my door. Another first! Usually if bringing something to the room it’s another interchange that requires among other things, another tip. I really appreciated Michael’s help – he was placing them, as he said, under the door – within minutes. Michael Love also wrote us the nicest note thanking us for our stay with them and included a gift certificate too. Wow, the hotel that keeps on giving. More from the all-star staff – awesome!\n",

      "Lobby - beautifully appointed with grand piano, tasteful yet comfortable furniture. There are two very large windows they span from floor to ceiling, so if you are waiting on people (as I was), it’s perfect to sit, have some lemon water or hot chocolate. Also, they have a wine reception in the late afternoon (complementary). I wasn’t able to make that but would have if I would have been around the hotel at that time. I didn’t snap a picture of the lobby, but it looked just like this that I plucked from dcluxuryhotels.com. The black chairs were very comfortable.\n",

      "We stayed in a suite which was really luxurious - roomy with lots of period furniture, and helpful staff on hand whenever required. Really tranquil and relaxing, I found the Waldorf the ideal place to catch my breath after the bustle of the city. I’d go back there in a heartbeat.\n",

The restaurant next door is just fine and the location is perfect, near Central Park and just off Broadway. The only problem with the hotel is that a lot of other visitors have discovered the Lucerne as well and I have found it very hard to find a room when I need one so I've had to venture out to other hotels, which have mostly been disappointing by comparison. Also, as the hotel's popularity has risen, prices have escalated. Alas!\n",

Everyone we encountered, from the front desk, to the valet, to the bellmen to the bartenders at happy hour treated us like royalty. Arnecia and her boss who we chatted with during the really great food and drink specials at happy hour at the bar made us feel like old friends visiting. We even got a hug during our last day! They also made some great restaurant recommendations. We got a tour of the building from Danny the bellman who went out of his way during a very busy day to take us around and discuss the history and renovations of the building. He even has some great ghost stories if you like to be spooked. I was also impressed when I walked by one of the maids on my way to our room and she asked me if I needed anything. Service here was really impressive. It is in a great location close to the gas lamp district. I would definitely stay here again when visiting the San Diego area. One tip: if you are looking for brochures, discounts or other info about attractions in the area, ask at the front desk as they keep them locked up....\n",

      "Text: You do get what you pay for, and yes this place can get expensive during peak times. However, this place truly showed its worth to us. We came here for the first time in May for our daughters 2nd birthday. We wanted a beach vacation and I found this place while searching hotels near Sea World. I instantly thought how it reminded me of our trip to Hawaii, and how perfect this place would be, being right on the bay and with a room feet away from the sand. It did not disappoint for a second. The pools were great, the bike rentals on sight, the restaurants, quick room service, other activities, ducks and fish all around the property, but most importantly the fire pit on the beach 10 feet from our door and water another 10 feet, this place provided such a wonderful time for us and our 2 year old, that it quickly became one of the best places we have ever visited, and we travel extensively. \n",
      "As a side note: we wanted to come back to San Diego the next month for a quick getaway, and this place was a little too pricey being that it was June. I found the Hilton, across the street almost, and thought it was similar in features. We had such a terrible experience there that we checked out the next morning and I called Paradise Point. We were upgraded all the way to the Presidential Suite, and they saved our vacation which had so been nearly ruined by the Hilton. I can not say enough about this place, and with all that they have done for us, and how we were treated both times, this is my FAVORITE place to stay in San Diego, and should not be missed. We are going back in September. My only mistake in June was not going with Paradise Point to begin with. Don't second guess this place. Find a good rate, go with AAA or Destination Delivers, or call them, but choose this place for a real great vacation.\n",

So when I had to come to Baltimore for some untidy family business (and my teenage daughter came with me), I tried to mix the situation with at least a nice place to stay near some sights. After doing my homework I chose the Hilton Garden Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor. Not only is it an excellent value with a lovely restaurant that offers a great breakfast, it's a great and safe location that is connected to a SUPERIOR GYM. The rooms are very comfortable with coffee machines, brand new bathrooms, great flat screen and FREE internet connection which no other hotel in the area offers. The staff is up to par with any 4 star hotel. Friendly, courteous, helpful and very professional. I wasn't thrilled that i had to pay twenty some dollars a night for parking but i was thrilled that the parking garage is connected to the hotel so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. The area is surrounded by boutiques, a movie theater, restaurants, little Italy and in walking distance to the shops at the Harbor. \n",

      "The Farmer's Daughter Hotel appears to have been designed as a quintessential \"motor court\" in the 50's or 60's. It has been redesigned and they have done an amazing job of working with in the constraints of the original structure. We stayed in room 101, located in a quiet corner of the property. I don't know what the other rooms look like so this is unique to 101. The room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural. The bedding was very comfortable. The faucet was style like an old fashioned sink pump. The shower was simple but included an adjustable rain style head and there was plenty of hot water.\n",
      "The staff were all very friendly and attentive. They made every attempt to accommodate us as we dealt with the logistics of visitors. They helped us find a great place to eat - \"Animal\" - just up the street. It didn't matter if it was midnight or 8 am, there was always a smile and helpful attitude. Over all I cannot say enough about the facility and staff. If you are in the West Hollywood area, don't miss the Farmer's Daughter.\n",

This hotel uses a \"pump\" system to dispense the various items in the shower as well as at the sink, preventing a TON of waste with the little bottles! There is also a safe, refrigerator and microwave in the two different rooms that we stayed in (two double beds as well as a single double bed room).\n",
      "The front desk staff was helpful, even though there was a little mixup when we checked in. There had been a large group that had checked in earlier in the day that wanted to move their rooms around for whatever reason. The person that had been working during that period accidentally gave away our room (two double beds) and we ended up staying in a single bed room for the night. The staff person quickly offered a lower price on the smaller room and indicated we could switch to our correct room the following night. No harm, no foul on that!\n",
      "One thing to watch out here is the breakfast room, especially on the weekend. We went into the room around 9am and it was a NUT HOUSE. They do not have enough seating for the size hotel that it is, so plan on getting your food and taking it back to your room. The other guests I found to be very rude in the breakfast room, acting as if it was their last meal. But, I guess that can sometimes be expected when there are free items in the room!\n",

Yes the lifts are old and slow but thats not a big problem except in the mornings when everyone tries to leave around the same time. We had an executive room which gave us free wi-fi - bonus! Our room had plenty of space but was not huge - enought for the two of us but the bathroom was tight. The shower in our bathroom was one of the best I've ever used. Windows that actually open. There was a mini bar, microwave and a safe. Soft and comfortable beds with clean and fresh linen. All in all the rooms were good. Unfortunately we decided to have breakfast downstairs one morning. It is a buffet but it really wasn't worth the effort. Bland, cold food that wasn't worth the money. Esp when there are so many good food places nearby. We didn't go back again.

      "At first I was apprehensive about having a room facing Columbus Avenue as I am a light sleeper and have read past reviews about the traffic noise but I was not kept awake by the street noises at all, however, as we were there from a Friday night to a Monday morning, the traffic noise may be different on a weekday.\n",

We then discovered a Cafe on Columbus Ave, heading 3 blocks towards Fishermans Wharf & across the road from The Holiday Inn. The Diner/Cafe (sorry can't remember the name) had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also. Located next to the Diner was an Internet Coffee Shop, we used the internet here to pre-checkin for our flight on Southwest Airlines and they also printed the Boarding passes for 50cents per page.\n",
      "The Columbus Inn was a fantastic find in a great location for a truely great price and we easily walked to Fishermans Wharf, Lombard Street and to the Pier which the ferry for Alcatraz tours leaves from and we caught the bus which leaves outside the hotel to Union Square and then caught the Cable Car back.\n",
      "I had originally booked a hotel in Union Square but then changed my mind and booked the Columbus Motor Inn mainly for the great price and for the additional bedroom and I was so glad that we didn't stay at Union Square as my husband and 2 teenage sons were not at all interested at shopping at all so I was glad we settled for a hotel that was close to Fishermans Wharf and the attractions that are in that area,.\n",

      "Text: I was expecting this hotel to be quite good in light of all the reviews that have been posted here. I was not dissapointed. The location is prime - there is a subway station just one block north from the hotel. We stayed in a room with a double bed and a private bathroom. It was small but manageable. It was decorated nicely, something you'd expect a suffragette to stay in during the early 1900s. There was a TV, a very efficient heater, and A/C. The rooms were cleaned each day very nicely. The hotel itself was quiet the entire time. Only on Saturday night did some street noise filter in, but we turned on the air to low and it was blocked out. Be sure to book your room through the internet or with the internet price on hand over the phone - it's much cheaper. The staff was friendly and the iron and ironing board I borrowed from them worked well. My only quip is that the man who checked us in gave us an uncomfortable and bothersome stare and remark about my boyfriend and I sharing a double bed. He wasn't hostile, but you sure don't expect it less than a mile from where the Stonewall riots took place. Also, the elevator is small but quaint with its archaic gated door. All in all, a great, great, great place for those people who don't need to be pampered and overcharged but enjoy sleeping in comfortable and quiet hotels.\n",

The front desk staff was very nice in offering early check-ins for me and another couple that were waiting for check-in time (3pm). I gladly took what was available so I could get a much needed nap before exploring the city. The elevator was busy with housekeeping using the 1 elevator, but I still didn't wait too long for it to be available for me to use. The housekeepers were friendly while I passed them by to get to my room. One of them even helped to make sure that my room was ready before I walked ion the room and bringing an extra blanket that she found missing. The room was very small but was very cozy. At the end of the room's hallway was one of the beds was very close to the wall and was obstructing passage to go around the bed. I have a picture of the bed near the wall and blocking the hallway. But, all and all, a nice small room. There were robes and nice bath amenities - which I gladly took home for a future bath or shower (the lotions and soaps, not the robes). The tv was small and didn't have many stations available but I didn't care since I was there to go out and be entertained by the city. I got a quiet room without a view which was perfectly quiet for me to take a nap and slept well later that night. The front desk in the morning were very nice and expedient. They also asked if I needed transportation and would help me if needed. The hotel is just across the street from Central Park.

You will have easy access to public transportation and will get a good night sleep at night. The price was the cheapest that I could find at the time.

However if you go a couple blocks past the Marriott and turn on Bell or Wall, you will find a municpal garage (says for cruises, but anyone can park there) for $14 a day ($10/day if you have a cruise receipt). It's about a 4 block walk back to the hotel. But if you prefer to pay $42 a day for valet, knock yourself out. 2. $12 a day for internet! Really!

      "Text: The Brown Palace was a gorgeous hotel within walking distance of plenty of shopping and a mall. I didn't realize there were tours, but heard a nearby tour party discussing some of the eerie fun ghost stories from the hotel. The tour guide was even dressed in old fashioned costume to fit the tale. I wish I could have stayed for the tea service, it looked lovely-definitely next time. Very comfortable bed, nice views, and great prime rib at this hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff as well. Definitely worth staying here.\n",

      "Text: Stay 1 night on Sept 3, 2009 using the Priority Club Points as we had to join a tour in the nearby Chinatown the next day and the location of this hotel from the pick up point is about 4 blocks away. Everyone is VERY NICE upon check in as my 3 yrs old daughter was crying out loud her heart to learn that we didn't stay in Sheraton LaGuardia as we did the previous 2 nights but here, I was really embarrassed but the check in staff was fanstastic, came out and tried to calm her down but futile. Beat me sometimes todlers are so \"sensitive \" & \"passionate\" about the hotel that they once stayed. \n",
      "The only complaint that I have is that the hotel will not hold our luggage for 2 nights if we don't have a future reservation and quoted us due to liability and suggested that we stored our lugguage in Penn Station. This is a crazy suggestion as we arrived in the late evening that night and will have no time to travel to Penn Station that night as we only need to store 1 piece so that the next morning we didn't need to drag 2 pieces of luggage when we joined our 3 days 2 nights tour to Philly, Washington DC/Niagara Falls and Thousand Island. We explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on 3rd day to Jersey City and would this change? No, SORRY, that is the reply! I found this VERY DISCRIMATING as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay, otherwise, once your stay is over, SORRY, you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem! In my prior stay of hotel like Sheraton Vancouver, they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding . This is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at Penn Station. So, apart from this issue of not able to hold our 1 piece luggage since we have no pending reservation, which I found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an UNHELPFUL hotel meeting guest needs.\n",
      "Overall, room is clean and comfortable as they put us on club floor and indeed, no street noise or subway train vibrations.

The front desk went out of their way to make this happen and they had no incentive to do it for us - they could have very well given us another room - I believe the person on the front desk that night was Eduardo (but I do not recollect his name). It was a 2000sq ft penthouse and the huge balcony has excellent views of the San Diego skyline. the marina is just steps away from the hotel and you can plan to watch a romantic sunset by the oceanside in rather silence. also, we were given free parking and breakfast vouchers for all 3 days of our stay - now that was surely a royal treatment.

As usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do. I booked late and through a third party site, during a very busy time in NY. While I was prepared for a broom closet with a bed, I was upgraded without request upon arrival. Later in my stay I met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in NY. I had to come back to the city the following week, and mentioned this to the manager as I was checking out. I had checked the 3rd party site, but the City Club wasn't showing any availability. Not only did the manager secure a room for me, but also at an extremely competitive price. He also gave me his card. I shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and BOOM. Another upgrade, this time to the two story suite. All I can say is don't die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach, boast two story windows, and a spiral staircase that is ultra hip....amazing, and would be well worth the standard suite price. Let me give 2 more quick asides about this place. 1. I was running late when i realized that I had forgotten a toiletry item. A call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes - this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel. Larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time. 2. The front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived. Then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and I should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room. The City Club is still in a great central location, with great design, and amenities, but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom. My wife wants to see the Yankee's in the playoff's for our Anniversary. Anybody wanna guess where we'll be staying? \n",

We would have had to bring them to the kennel which woud have been more than our room rate. We had an awful dinner at Forty Five Degrees (no fault to the hotel), so I was hungry when we got back to the room later that evening. Thank goodness for the 24 hour Bridgemart! Beef Jerky, Popcorn, Pop Tarts and Water and I was set! Great decor and great comfort. Thank you to all of the staff. The desk agent even has a Bischon like me! Kudos to a job well done!\n",

      "Text: I just spent two nights in this hotel and was terrified before arriving and desperately tried [but failed]to book other accomodations after reading reviews on this site. Needless to say I asked to see the \"suite\" we booked before presenting our credit card. The friendly desk clerk obliged with no problem. The rooms were small as advertised, but clean. The bathroom was miniscule, but adequate, and spotlessly clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows were of high quality. There was no sign of any bugs, either cockroaches or bedbugs. Our rooms were freshly painted and there was no sight of peeling paint anywhere. I slept like a baby with the window open. The second night I asked the desk for another blanket and it was on my bed upon my return. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The subway is two short blocks away, and cabs were easily caught on West End Avenue, a block away. If your plan is to find inexpensive accomodations and are travelling with a friend or with children, the suite at $109/night is unbeatable. The two rooms connected by the bath gave us privacy we could have never had in a standard double room. I will stay here again.\n",

This was busy but not overly hectic Friday morning, so when I got outside and found out that there was no car and no knowledge of getting my request 30 mins earlier, I was not impressed with the staff's ability to follow-through. I ended having to wait another 10 mins to get my car and when the valet showed up with it he was very apologetic but also did not offer to help with my bags, he only did so after I asked if he could grab them off the luggage carrier. \n",

Our room was amazing two double beds, kitchen area with full size fridge/freezer and everything you could possibly need, the bathroom was plenty big enough with a shower in the corner and the water was always hot. We always had clean towels and our cups and coffee maker were always cleaned while we were out. Breakfast was fine and we always found a table to eat it, didn't need to take it to the room although some people chose to do so, we found it an opportunity to chat to other guests. I had noticed before leaving the UK there were comments about the street the hotel was in, as two females on our own we felt very safe and never once felt threatened or uncomfortable, the shop selling sexy lingerie and sex toys made us laugh, not that we went in, just what we saw from the door as we passed and in the window! The parole office was just another place no shady characters around that I saw, but then I wasn't looking to find anything wrong with the area!!

The pools were very nice. Restaurant was pretty good. I believe it was called the Verandah but not sure. My daughter liked the children's menu. I had the buffet one night which was pretty good but could have been a lot better for the price. The paella was probably the worst I've ever eaten with sticky, sticky rice, and the puff pastery that the swordfish was cooked in was chewy. I had to pick it off just to get to the fish. My husband had one of the few chicken dishes which he thought was fair. Breakfast buffet was good which was included in our room rate otherwise it would have been $50.00 for the three of us. My only real complaint about this hotel is that the beds were as hard as a rock! I had the hardest time falling asleep the first night and that was after a few glasses of wine. I would hardly call the room that I stayed in a 4 star. The decor was a little boring though the bathroom was nice. To me it seemed the room needed updating...especially those beds.

As an older woman relaxing in a warm bath is an important stress reliever for me and a normal part of my day. When I was young a room with just a shower was called a half bath, and you only found them in the cheapest motels. But I now have come to understand that modern people don't take baths, only showers, so this new hotel was built without many tubs. I tried to be a good sport, but felt unhappy. Laurie at the front desk picked up on this and decided to upgrade me to a suite (with a spa bath). It could not have been more lovely. In addition to a generally sensitive and helpful staff this hotel has everything anyone could want. It's very clean, quiet, and beautifully appointed. The beds are comfortable, the artwork attractive. The restaurant is also very good. I do plan to return and when I do I'll make sure when I book that my room has a tub.\n",

They took care of our bags and our car as we proceeded to check-in. We had reserved a one bedroom suite, which turned out to be quite nice.

The bellman unloaded our luggage to their respective places, showed us the room and welcomed us to the hotel. The only problem we had with the room was that they gave us a king instead of 2 doubles so our daughters had nowhere to sleep. I immediately called the front desk, they quickly apologized for the mixup and said they would send up two complimentary rollaways. The rollaways were brought up within 10 minutes of the call and fit perfectly in the livingroom, since the room was quite large.\n",

The Marriott is located in an absolutely safe and quiet part of downtown, so that we had a peaceful and undisturbed sleep during each night. Breakfast at Roy's has been a good start into our day, but if someone wants to, he could also find many quality breakfast cafes and restaurants close to the hotel. Subway station is a 3 min. stroll away and within just 15 min. after locking your room you're right in the middle of Time's Square.

      "Text: Stayed 2 nights at the Biltmore between Xmas and New Year 2008. Fabulous room (I think we were on a \"special\" floor , but not sure as I didn't do the booking), with a four poster bed. Amazing old style common areas with very grand decorations. Bathrooms small and a little old fashioned, but if anything it added to the \"cosy\" traditional feel of the place. To be recommended if you are looking for some character and don't mind being in what seems like a slightly out-of-the-way area. We had 2 good evening meals within walking distance - Roy's, which is Hawaiian-fusion and at Engine no. 28 which is American. Both absolutely EXCELLENT with great service.\n",

The hotel even provided Aveda bath salts for the huge tub. The staff was friendly and cheerful. In honor of our anniversary, the hotel had a bottle of bubbly and a gift box of delicious treats waiting in our room. We loved the coffee/tea set up in the morning and the ice water that was available all day. Although we did not participate every evening, the wine reception each day was a great option before heading out to dinner and a show. We love to walk, so the location was not an issue for us, but it is a good three blocks to the nearest Metro station and farther for some lines. Dinner at their restaurant, Print, was excellent. We also really enjoyed Stecchino Wine Bar on 9th, PJ Clarkes across from Lincoln Center – try the lobster BLT, Caffee Ciello on 8th, and picking up some take out from the Amish Market on 9th. Sunday morning, we took a walk along the river and then came back through Chelsea where we had a great breakfast at Le Grainne. Another favorite for us is Crepes on Columbus, followed by walking the full length of Central Park. We met many fine local people who were all eager for us to enjoy their city.

It had two queen beds that were extremely comfortable as well as a large pull out sofa and kitchenette. We requested a handicap room and the bathroom was wonderful. It was very large, with a roll-in shower. The pool was clean as well as the area surrounding the pool. Everything was well maintained at this property. The free breakfast was delicious with lots to choose from, including a fantastic waffle maker. You could eat indoors or outside. They were in the process of setting up a nice little \"bar\" area in the lobby while I was there. They have two computers in the lobby that you can use for free. Elevators were spacious and fast. The staff were outstanding. I'm sorry I didn't get the name of the lady who was extremely helpful in getting our handicap room keys so I could mention her here. There was a gentleman named Kevin who was also very nice and helpful (the shorter of the 2 Kevin's). The best part was the location. You walk out the door and right onto the $1.00 trolley downtown to Beale St. or you could walk (10 mins - I timed it twice). It was on a very lovely tree lined street with a park across the street as well as a Walgreen's and great restaurants. Sam's (on the corner) had a wonderful chicken breast sandwich & fries for $6.50! Another restaurant on the next corner called \"The Flight\" (I think) was also very nice - a little more elegant and a little more pricey but very good food - $11-$26 for chicken or steak dinner, depending on the size you order. Beale St. had a great bar called \"Wet Willie's\". I highly recommend this property!\n",

I booked five nights on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the bed. It's better than the one I have at home and mine is a very high quality mattress. The room was spotlessly clean and the bath area had been recently remodeled with very high quality tile (and a pattern even). It was a suite-sized space, with a love seat, king bed, fridge, microwave, CD player and DVD player. Now, for the fun of the place.... When I turned the lights off at night, stars glowed on the walls and the ceilings. There was a blacklight and some really neat murals on the walls. When I came the first time, I had asked for bedside lights to read by since the room didn't have any. I also could not get wireless, plus had a broken bathplug. When I came to my room later the same day as mentioning it to the manager, the tub was fixed, I had a hardwire cord in my room for internet and two bedside lamps. I was so impressed! Any property can have issues, but it's how quick they are addressed that makes such a difference. This was whiplash fast! Now for the really good part. I came back two weeks later for an overnight trip. When I arrived to check in, the same nice manager had the same room reserved for me. He greeted me warmly and said he had the room I liked, the lamps and the internet ready for me. I was so touched to see what a great memory he had and how helpful he was! You know, it's really great to have people care about what they do and to do it the best they can. I travel a lot for business and I must say that I really feel welcome here, like my business matters. You don't get that much these days, especially for a such a great value.\n",

I've been in 3 so far, all located in California (San Francisco, Monterey and Santa Monica) I really recommend them as they are always very clean, quite new, the value is very good comparing to the rate (around 100$US) and the breakfast was always excellent. In SF, we ask for a room with a view to the Golden Gate Bridge for less than 50$ and it really worth it! \n",

      "I was given a room right next to the elevator, although the hotel was clearly all but empty. Upon getting to my room, I found a CD of \"soothing\" music that the Crowne Plaza provides to guests to help them \"relax.\" I soon learned that this CD is apparently intended to help you drown out the noise that bleeds through the walls. I could hear every word of the telephone conversation that occurred in the room next to me, and the racket from the elevator kept me up all night. \n",
      "The bed was one of the worst I have ever encountered. There were crumbs and little pieces of chocolate on top of the \"clean\" comforter when I got ready for bed, and the pillows felt more like old afghans stuffed into pillowcases. The room itself was dingy, the furniture was in terrible shape, and the thermostat was dysfunctional. The temperature fluctuated between 65-80 degrees all night. In addition, there was a floodlight pointed straight into my window from the parking deck below. The hotel staff had thoughtfully provided a clothespin so that you could shut the curtains, but enough light made it through that I did not have to turn on a lamp to read - and I did plenty of reading that night since it was impossible to sleep!\n",
      "I generally try to be optimistic and laid back when traveling, but the Crowne Plaza Charlotte really tested my patience. I don't like to complain, and since I was only staying one night, I decided not to contact the front desk about all of these problems.

It was within walking distance of both the waterfront and Pike Place Market, and we could easily take the monorail to the Space Needle. (There are hills in Seattle, so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking, you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi.) Both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated, and the staff was very helpful. Being on Pioneer Square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and/or something to eat. Of course, we didn't walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there, but that's just common sense. We were never bothered by anyone, and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city. If you're worried about street noise, call the hotel directly and ask for an \"interior\" room. We had an \"interior king\" and it was very quiet. We plan to return to Seattle, and when we do, we'll stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel again.\n",

When I inquired again about our room 1.5 hours later we were told that it wasn't ready yet. Still way before the 3:00 check in time so we decided to take a walk outside just as we were about to leave the premises one of the desk staff ran outside ( in about 30 degree weather) to catch up with us to tell us that our room was indeed ready. That is what I call service. The entire staff from the doorman to the maids were always pleasant and accomandating. I would absolutely recommend the hotel. There are a number of resturants within walking distance and the zoo is a short 4 blocks up the street. It is a short cab ride away from the National Mall and monuments ( $15. each way) but nice because it is away from the hustle and bustle. The room was enormous and clean and as a Omni Select Choice member were given complimentary beverages each morning and for a few dollars extra able to order a bagel or muffin which was just enough to hold us over until lunch.

Really awesome considering we were on what is considered a busy street!\n",
      " This hotel is in \"the loop.\" Like I said I have never been to Chicago so I had no idea what all these neighborhoods meant. What was the difference between magnificent mile and the loop? or lincoln park? well... the loop is the business center/ theater center. it is also right next to Millenium park which is a nice place to walk around. chicago isnt that large so you can walk around to just about any area and the subway is really easy to navigate so that is a big plus. There was plenty of \"regular\" shopping such as H&M, oldnavy, walgreens, macys (marshall fields), gap, ny and co, and more. If you want highend shopping you go to magnificent mile. \n",
      "The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Reginald greeted us and after we checked in gave us the tour of the room! The staff seems small (which is a great bonus to being in a boutique hotel) because they all knew who we were and we knew them. They were all really helpful with recommending places to eat, calling for reservations, and giving directions on where to go. When my moms wallet was lost they looked up phone numbers of the taxi companies so I could call and see if it was found. \n",
      "The hotel has a small gym but it was up to date and never crowded. The restuarant Atwood cafe had very busy lunch and dinners filled with locals. We only ate a breakfast there. It was good and really pretty inside.\n",

As a plat member, was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin (which is more spacious, got an extra window balcony to sit on). However, was travelling with friends so I requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead, no problems.\n",
      "Lobby: The staffs were friendly and efficient, the lobby is very hip/chic just like what you would expect at the typical W hotel. I like the hotel ambience espcially at night, so pretty. You'll see many people hanging out at the lobby XYZ bars at night time (There's a DJ there too). There's an Acura MDX Experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an one-way ride to most of the places in SF area (except airport, of course) and we did take advantage of it during our stay. The drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus. But due to the popular demand, I recommend reserve your time spot early!\n",
      "The Gym: Very nice, with complete sets of eplical machines, weights, and the swim pool /jacuzzi is right outside of the gym (which is very hip looking too). The gym opens 24/7 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm. Bliss Spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their mani/pedicure and other services but I did not get to try it out so I am not going to commend on that.\n",
      "The Room: Some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation (so for those who hates siren at night, you should request a room away from the firestation). Good AC (very quiet), and the lights in the room are very nice too. The bed is the typical W bed, not as heavenly as the Westin Heavenly Bed but certainly better than Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and other competitor's bed. I actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after I stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep. That tells you how much I like their bedding. The room is towards the small size (~300 sq ft?) but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff. The shower pressure is good, not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean. Toiletries is the standard Bliss Sinkside 6 (lemon sage scent) which is one of my favorite hotel product. One thing, the bathroom door has no lock and its very clear/see thru!! so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it! This is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey, its W so you need to be more open minded about it. Turndown service available on request every evening.\n",
      "Parking: $42/night, 1/2 off if you drive a hybrid. Since its SF, I did not drive, its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isn't it? Also, internet (WiFi) are free at the lobby so you'll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day.\n",
      "Overall: This is a good, well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more \"freshier\" look instead of the dark depressing color. Some people liked it, some don't. Of course, the price can be high for most people (at least 200+/night) but if you want to have fun, meet people or just want to enjoy the W scene, you should give this property a try. Don't stay there if you want a QUIET weekend getaway. W is all about fun :D\n",

The only problem I had was at check-in. I had prepaid and the man at the desk told me that I had only paid for 1 person per room. I insisted that I had paid for 4 people per room and he argued with me. I was able to show him my confirmation with proof that I had paid for 12 people(Even though I only had 10). Then he told me that the teenagers that were with me weren't under the age of 17. He finally let it go but without proof he would of charged me more money.\n",

The room was much bigger than I'd expected (after reading some reviews on trip advisor) although the bathroom was smallish. However we were in New York and not intendng on spending much time in the room at all. The location was fantastic, we used the subway to get about which meant it was so easy to get to and from the hotel at any time of the day. We ate in the Commodore Grill on our first night as they were listed in \"Winter Restaurant Week\", we did not however end up eating from this menu due to the time we had to wait to get seated and served. The food was good when it finally came however. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would return in the future. I was pleasantly surprised after looking at previous reviews on this site.\n",

Rates included a free happy hour every early evening with beer, wine, and munchies, as well as a fabulous buffet breakfast each morning. Though no rates are cheap for New York hotels, the above-mentioned amenities must be factored into the price, as their being included would add a hefty sum in a different hotel. The only small gripe I might mention is that, when serving breakfast in the large chafing dishes each morning, the eggs, bacon, etc. have gotten lukewarm or cool after a short while. This might be remedied by having a source of heat under each large chafing dish, similar to the stern that is put under fondue pots. Other than this small item. I can find nothing to complain about with the nice room and friendly staff. Oh, yes, the nice large flat-screen TV plus various free newspapers each morning are a welcome treat.\n",

It was really nice to come back to this beautiful hotel and relax at the pool - which was incredible - complete with drink and food service, and a 24 hour fitness center. We booked two rooms (one a suite), and the hotel accommodated us nicely, placing the rooms next to each other. We did enjoy our stay - even though we had the misfortune of being there two nights when fire alarms went off (the week prior to 4th of July). Being an Omni Select member, I expressed my dissatisfaction and insisted that I would only be happy if fully compensated for the nights that were interrupted by the alarms. I know others reviewed this hotel and were very unhappy with the fire alarm situation, but to tell you the truth, the hotel did deal with it well - in my situation - maybe becauseI was more assertive in expressing what I expected of them! Thus, I am still rating the Omni 5 stars, and I hope the they have corrected the faulty alarm system, so that no one has to experience being evacuated without just cause. In summary, I would give this advice to my fellow travelers: If you are at all dissatisfied with a stay, be professional and polite and express yourself. If you don't get the answer you are looking for, make sure you are dealing with the manager. If you still don't get the answer you are looking for, write to a manager in the corporate office. That usually works, especially if you are a frequent guest of that particular hotel chain.\n",

      "Text: The great Broadway composer Alan Jay Lerner used to quote Sibelius – ‘in all the cities, in all the towns, in all the villages all over the world, no-one has ever erected a statue to a critic’. So whatever I write about the Doubletree Guest Suite on Times Square has to be personal and subjective. I happen to like New York. And am here several times a year. When I stay with more than one person I aim for the Doubletree. It really is very good value for two people who like each other a lot, but not too much. There is plenty of room; and surprisingly, not much sound leakage between the internal rooms in the suite. The check-in was smooth and friendly and the first room we offered seemed fine – away from elevators and ice machines as requested – but it had an adjoining door to the suite next door. Avoid. Two of God’s Little Ones decided 8.00pm was the time to scream. So having just checked in and unpacked, we asked to be moved. The Front Desk and then the Duty Manager could not have been less sympathetic. Yes, they changed the room without question, but we had to go to the new room with no question of a porter being offered to bring the new key and help to move bags. I later spoke with the Assistant Front Office Manager who was positively hostile, implying it was my fault the children were screaming in the room next door. She was a real let down to the Hilton chain. And then we moved rooms. It was fine and, phew!, quiet. Of course, the safe didn’t work but an engineer fixed it within minutes. Likewise a clock radio, ditto. When a good hotel fails, it responds well and promptly. The Doubletree did just this. And that night when we returned to our room, late, there was a bowl of fruit and chocolate with a hand-written apology from the Duty Manager. A classy solution to the earlier unhappiness. Would I recommend this Doubletree Guest Suite? Absolutely, quiet, roomy, friendly and at the crossroads of one of the most exciting destinations in the world.\n",

      "Text: Worst excuse for a \"luxury\" hotel I've ever seen, anywhere, including the Third or Fourth World. aStayed in \"Upgraded\" king room with Hilton Diamond (highest) status. Rooms are extremely dated and in poor condition. Bed and bed linens smelled as if they had not been changed from the last guest, the beds had to be changed twice on check in and the pillows had to be swapped out for new ones. Room was not ready, despite Diamond Status and notification to the hotel upon booking of time of arrival. Carpet was so worn as to be slippery, and indeed we did both slip several times. Very, very loud, even for location. I have lived in and visited Manhattan my whole life, and I assure you there are much better hotels at the price - try the Sherry Netherland or Lowe's Regency. When I was a child in Manhattan this was known as an hotel for business, parvenu tourists, and an \"event\" venue for second rate debutante balls - but I cannot think anyone in even any of these classes would put up with this hotel. If you really think there is something special about this hotel, visit the lobby and the bar - if you need to get your hair done, go the Kenneth's by all means - but for Heaven's sake, stay elsewhere!\n",

By NYC standards, the room was big and the bathroom was huge. It is true that the room furnishings were showing a little wear, but the true beauty of the room lies in the glass walls which put a panoramic view of NYC on display. At night, the view was memorable. The Tempurpedic (spelled that wrong?) bed was beyond comfortable to me, although spouse thought it was not firm enough. The room has a small bar with a fridge that you can use for your own items. Cookies or fudge left by the turndown staff - nice touch! The club at night is popular, but we never had a problem getting back into the hotel. I liked having nightlife right in the hotel (so convenient to head upstairs to sleep when you've had enough!), but some may be turned off by that. The only downside to our stay was that Saturday night was noisy outside; even on the 18th floor we could hear the street noise until 5 a.m. Friday night was fine. I would suggest a stop at the attached hair salon; I had the best blow-out of my life and Serge was a great stylist.

      "Text: A friend and I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for the fourth of July Weekend. The hotel was very nice. The location was amazing. We could walk almost anywhere. The room was very nicely appointed and the bed was sooo comfortable. Eventhough the bathroom door did not close all the way, it was still pretty private. My friend and I were not put off by the door. I really liked the Sangria during the cocktail hour in the living room. But what I liked best about the Palomar was the staff. They were soooo nice and accomodating from my boy D money at the door, to the ladies at reception, to my new friend Greg in housekeeping and my other friend Ricky. Any questions or request we had were answered and fulfilled. They had us smiling and laughing the whole time. We really appreciated all the information they provided us with about where to go and what to do. When I come back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Palomar again. I am sure there are other nice hotels in Chicago but I am not sure if you would get the same level of friendliness and attentiveness from their staff. If you stay at the hotel and the doorman D is there tell him that G Money sent you. Lol.\n",

We were upgraded to a wonderful Sorrento King Suite - gorgeous bedroom and sitting room. Everything spotlessly clean and so comfy. Gorgeous flowers and wine waiting for me as ordered by my OH, but also a lovely card, chocolates and wine from the hotel. We loved the Sorrento - it's a hotel with great warmth and character and the staff can't do too much for you. Had a lovely meal in the restaurant - with a surprise birthday delicious dessert cake with candle! Car valet worked a treat. Location was good - we happily walked just about everywhere in Seattle, but sometimes took a cab back up the hill. If we're lucky enough to return to Seattle, we will definitely stay at the Sorrento.\n",

This can't be a fluke or good luck, must be part of their business plan! \n",
      "Weeks before we arrived, concierge Mona helped not just with suggestions but made arrangements for every detail from hot air ballooning to horseback riding to spa appointment. She kept in touch through email and phone calls to clarify details of our trip and to remind us of all sorts of things (like don't plan any outdoor activities between 9a and sunset during the Arizona summer! - thank goodness she warned us!). Upon arrival we met the quickest and most courteous valets in the business. While we were still pulling in looking lost at 11p trying to make sure we were in the right spot, two valets appeared, one on each side of the car and gently whisked away the car keys and our luggage and took care of everything! Everytime we needed the car they had it waiting for us outside in what seemed to be under 60seconds and every time we returned we were always greeted with two valets to help escort us and our baggages out of the car. \n",

It was scary how he always seemed to anticipate our every need well before we even realized it. Before we realized we were parched he was right there with large cups of lemon ice water - and refilled it well before it ever reached halfway empty. If we looked a little uncomfortable from a towel that was too wet, before we could decide what to do Jose was there with a dry towel...and he provided this degree of excellent service to every guest at the pool!\n",

Very cozy and clean, but was disappointed that patio doors opened up to communal walking path and there was no view of the mountains. Will try for a balcony suite next time. Room may not be as spacious as other resorts, but decor very unique - they even had some classic books laying on ledges around the room which was a nice touch. \n",

Our room was on the 7th floor and very well laid out, although a little smaller than other Hilton Garden Inns we had stayed with at LAX and Washington Downtown. The usual high standard that we had come to expect from the Hilton brand was present with very comfortable furnishings. Everything was very clean and functioning. Our view was over 48th Street from the 7th floor, and not very inspiring.\n",

However, during the night I only heard them go out using a very brief low level siren for a few seconds, and that was before I had gone to bed. I never heard them again at night after I had gone to sleep, and I am a light sleeper. I would not let that be a concern to anyone considering this hotel.\n",

The other suggestion was for the AirTrain from Penn Station as only taking about 20mins, but we would have had to take a cab to Penn Station.

I had read some negative reviews on TripAdvisor, so was a bit apprehensive about our stay. From the moment we arrived, though, I saw there was no need for apprehension. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful from the beginning to the end of our stay. The location was fantastic. My husband had suggested we rent a car at the airport, but I told him from what I had read it didn't seem that there was a need for one. He admitted at the end of the weekend that there was not, plus we saved having to pay for parking at the hotel. (Of course we did have the taxi fare each way to and from the airport, also would have to rely on the free shuttle from Sun Studio to Graceland if you didn't have a car and wanted to go there.) The hotel location was perfect for downtown sightseeing - Mudd Island, riverboat cruise, Beale Street all a very easy walk. It was also an easy walk to great restaurants like Flight, and a two name restaurant, second name Suzanne, both of which we enjoyed during our visit. The trolley stops were at the back of the hotel, which made it convenient for transportation to the Civil Rights Museum, farmer's market, other parts of town. I did have a friend who drove me to Graceland, but otherwise there is the free shuttle from Sun Studio (think you can access the timetable online). We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel's complimentary breakfast and thought they had quite a bit to choose from. Wasn't Breakfast at Tiffany's, but still a very nice beginning to the day.

We thought the pressure in the shower was awesome and the curtains kept the light from coming in so it was super dark in the morning, which we like. It's little things like that that make a big difference. We didn't hear any of our neighbors (we later traveled to 2 other locations and stayed in cheaper hotels where we could hear everything.) The breakfast was fine. The first day there weren't any eggs but everytime afterwards, there were hard boiled eggs. The coffee was delicious and the waffle maker was fun. They had the other usual things, bagels, danishes, yogurt, fruit and juice. We didn't rent a car and had to rely on the buses. The front desk couldn't provide too much assistance on the buses. The shuttle van is good for downtown locations only and the driver was very friendly. I would recommend this place to all my friends.\n",

The Churchill is in an older building and brings a classic older traveling experience. Beautifully appointed and the staff was exceptional. When I opened the door to my room, I was taken aback with the sound of classic music, lights on, and an open expanse of a large room with flat screen TV, a separate room for an office and coffee setup. The furniture appears antique and beautiful. I could not ask for more in a room. I cannot wait to go back with my family.\n",

There was also a walk in closet with a hairdryer, iron and ironing board inside.

Greg the door man was very helpful, we were checked in promptly and our room was immaculate. Loved the Gilchrist and Soames toiletries and the shower! Bed was super comfy and the room was spacious. And while there is not an abundance of shops and restaurants in the immediate area, they are not far away. We ate dinner at Hackney's Irish Pub (a recommendation from Greg) which had authentic pub grub and I've only had better fish & chips in England. Greg also suggested a great jazz club on Clark St. called Close Up 2, so we changed for the evening, drank cocktails in the Custom House restaurant and set off for a great night of live music.\n",

Dinner in the Laurel Room was great, but not spectacular. Presentation was lovely. The ambiance of the hotel was very nice and gave off a relaxing and not to stuffy feeling.\n",

Since they can get away with it, I guess they might as well....Breakfast pricing was steep as well - $29 for the buffet (albeit a very nice one) per person. I guess that's what you should expect in a hotel like that anyways. $13.95 for internet service in the room?? They should offer free WiFi!\n",

      "Text: We stayed at the Edison for the first time from 31st January to 6th February and were delighted with our stay. We normally go cheap and cheerful and book in to Milford Plaza when in NY but decided to change to the Edison a week before our stay as we had the option of taking a suite for a little more than what we were paying at the Milford. We were not disappointed with this decision. The Milford is currently a building site and would have meant for an awful stay in NY. In comparison, we found the Edison to be peaceful, relaxing, friendly, clean, and an ideal location. As one of our party has not been keeping great health recently, taking a suite was the ideal decision as it meant he was able to relax in much more comfort. Yes, the room was a little dated but you get what you pay for -if I wanted super luxurious, modern quality I would have gone elsewhere and paid three times the price. That said, the suite was clean, comfortable, the bed was soft, the bathroom well stocked and clean, and we really couldn't find fault. I have read reviews on here of construction work going on - I was not aware of any work going on in the hotel, maybe we were just lucky. Will we back? Oh yes. The Milford's loss is the Edison's gain and I look forward to our next stay with great anticipation.\n",

      "Text: Stayed at the Omni Parker House Hotel for 3 nights in Oct/Nov. There were 3 of us two adults and 10 year old daughter. This is a very old hotel with lots of history. This is just what we wanted. If you want modern and cold this hotel is not for you. It is perfectly located right on the Freedom Trail and central to everything. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I was a little apprehensive having read previous reviews concerning the construction work and the small rooms. Our room was on 14th floor and I can honestly say that the construction work did not bother us at all. In fact, my husband found it very interesting watching the progress of the work from time to time. I really enjoyed the beautiful view of the Boston skyline at one point I could see as far as the river. Yes the work started early in the morning but who goes to Boston to stay in bed! Our room had 2 double beds and plenty of room for all 3 of us. It was a warm and cosy room and spotlessly clean. The complimentary (select guest) coffee and hot chocolate for my daughter left at the door each morning with a complimentary newspaper was a lovely touch. Our room was cleaned each day and towels, soaps etc were all replaced.\n",
      "We had breakfast (buffet $18 and $10 for child) each morning in the beautiful dining room. This was very good value especially when you convert to Euros. The staff were very helpful and welcoming even calling my daughter by her first name after first meeting. This was a wonderful way to start each day! We did not have dinner in the Hotel as there were so many places in Boston we wanted to try. I did see the Menu and it looked good! We had lunch in the Last Hurrah before we left for the Airport . My daughter had a lovely caesar Salad and I had the famous \"chowda\" which was to die for! Again the staff here were very effecient and very welcoming.\n",
      "I was a little concerned that this hotel might be a little dull for our daughter but this was not the case even though she seemed to be the only child around for the first couple of days. She enjoyed every minute of it and even received an Omni Kids Pack which contained all sorts of goodies.\n",
      "I cannot recommend this hotel enough for anyone visiting the wonderful city of Boston and we cannot wait to return in the future.\n",

Tucked away off the main stretch of Westwood, the location is homey, but a very short walk to Westwood Village. The front desk and valet were all very friendly and welcoming. The elevators have this cool camera that makes a montage poster of you as you're riding up (although it may catch you slouching and looking like a schlub). \n",

I also got a really cool view of the pool.\n",

All this fits in with a corporate sense of humor that includes its motto, “Thank you for sleeping with us.”\n",
      "One disclaimer about this review: I received a free upgrade due to the unavailability of the class of room I had booked. I don’t know what my cheaper room would have been like; but the room I got had a refrigerator, coffee-making supplies, a manual pencil sharpener (more of that sense of humor!), a guitar (I didn’t check to see if it was functional), and some op-art-ish wallpaper to offset the mostly black-and-white décor. There was a flat-panel TV and a feature-packed but austere-looking clock radio into which one could plug personal audio devices.\n",

After having read some of the reviews here, though, I was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel. We arrived around 11 am, figuring we could at least check our bags. Check in is at 4 pm, and we were initially told to return then - but the concierge told us we could come back at 2 and a room would probably be ready. This was fine - we did some sightseeing and then returned. The room was not yet ready; however the bellman had already brought out our bags and so they had to be rechecked. No problem so far. We came back at 4 and check in itself went smoothly - however they had lost our bags. After some frantic searching in different employees' offices, they were finally located. It's this kind of disinterested service ethos that really brings the Raffaello down - it's the level of service one would expect from a college town Days Inn. The employees at the Raffaello are affable enough, but they really don't want to concern themselves with any problems or questions guests may have - they seem to universally want guests to just go away and leave them alone. Lousy service aside, the room itself was as pictured - quite lovely actually. Bed was great - tv was nice - all were up to snuff. Location can't be beat for the price - right off Michigan Ave. behind the Hancock building. I would probably still stay here again - I just wouldn't check my bags with them. If they find a way to work out the service kinks this could be quite a nice hotel. FYI - they charge 40 bucks a day for valet parking - and all they do is drive your car to the deck across the street. You can self park there for $23 for 24 hours.\n",

The place was clean and modern, food was good, and location is great because of the local malls and highways and only 1/2 hour from downtown with traffic! I've always like hampton inn better because of their breakfast but this place comes in at a close 2nd for the category of hotel class that it is in. \n",

      "BTW, despite it being a cheaper hotel right next to expensive hotels, the other guests were not obnoxious & noisy, and etc. which is what I always worry about. The guests were all different family sizes, races, ages, etc, and all nice! But we did notice the next morning a car's back window was busted out. I have no idea if it was from theft or vandalism, but I'm guessing most likely someone must have left valuables in their car rather than random violence because the area does not seem like that.\n",

We had to go to the Los Angeles area for business quite a few times over the past several years and each time we stayed at the Bel Air. The surroundings are lush and feel entirely removed from the hussle and traffic that I've known to be LA. While one of the Concierges and a front desk staff were a little snooty, it was more than made up for by the wonderful bellman, the delicous food, the amazing pool (the pool is a must-see) as well as our terrific massages. Well, let me qualify that by saying that the couple of massages we got were actually not that great, but then we discovered Sascha and Eida and we were hooked. Be sure to ask for them or you may be as disappointed as we were at first. Prices range as do the rooms, but there's something there for everyone. We've had a different room everytime and always were happy. I wouldn't stay near the pool unless you have kids though. Enjoy!\n",

We wandered out to grab a bite to eat at one of our favorite Pizza Places Patzeria Pizza on 46th and gave our kids (their first time in NYC) a glympse of Times Square at night. We returned to the Hilton it was like a haven, we were exhausted and needed sleep. The rooms are clean and not too cramped, the beds were very comfortable and we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful if needed. The next day we walked & walked along the Hudson right down to the Financial District, where believe it or not we bumped into the singer Cee Lo Green, kids thought that was cool. We only stayed two nights as we were leaving from NYC on the Carnival Miracle for a Caribbean Cruise, which we saw arriving, along the Hudson, that morning from our room at the Hilton. All in all a very nice stay at Hilton Times Square.\n",

      "Text: Corny but accurate. We visit SA frequently as we only live 80 miles north. We've stayed at many Riverwalk hotels and while there's some worthy competitors the Westin is our favorite. The staff is well trained and friendly (unlike a competitor one block east). The spa while under promoted and hidden down a hallway was fantastic.Two thumbs way up to Dora for the wonderful massages! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and of course the heavenly bedding is wonderful. The only negative is that both the pool area and health club are in need of a face lift if not a makeover. The gym has far too much equipment jambed into a small room off the pool. If you use the treadmills (which we both do) you'll feel like a sardine with the stranger next to you being only inches away. I'm a retired pool builder so a little hypersensitive about pool areas but this is a residential size pool serving a large hotel so managing families with guests who like a quieter pool scene is difficult. Perhaps management can come up with a creative solution because if you like to lay around the pool, have a beer and read a magazine then you'll find the half a dozen screaming kids (the parents of which do nothing to control) just a little irritating. The pool area itself is overdue for a serious cleaning. The concrete decking was filthy, some sling chairs need replacement and there were only enough terry cloth covers for about 6 of the chaise lounge chairs. The bartender and bar were nice but Westin needs to give this area some attention because while the hotel is 4 stars the pool area comes in around a 2.5. Unless you spend 100 percent of your stay around the pool you won't be disappointed at the Westin.\n",

Location is good--it's halfway between the F/V (6th and 23rd) and 1 (7th and 28th) subway stops, although the 1 is slightly closer. There are convenience stores, drugstores and restaurants just steps away: CVS and Duane Reade on 6th, Chipotle and BRGR on 7th. I recommend Supermac on 7th just south of 29th: multiple varieties of macaroni and cheese. \n",
      "Received an \"upgrade\" on arrival to a king bed on 14. Small, NY style room, and really tiny bathroom (bathroom even tinier than the ones at the Radisson Lexington). But everything was clean and comfortable. Flat-screen TV with many stations, about 1/3 of which didn't come in. FREE INTERNET! (Wired or wireless--I went with wired--but be sure all the ethernet cables are connected properly.) I had no noise problems--I could only hear people if they were in the hall outside my door. It was super cold during my stay, and it was kind of hard to keep the room warm because the cold kept radiating from the window, but it was better the last day when it got up to freezing. Staff was pretty friendly for a NY hotel, greeting all the guests as they got off the elevators (no long elevator waits, either). The bartender even changed a $100 for me. The only problem I had was one day when I left my room at noon, it was not cleaned when I got back. I called down and someone came right up and changed the towels and made the bed. I appreciated that; I've had hotels tell me I was out of luck before when that happened.\n",

You are 1 block away from some outstanding bars and restaurants in the area. The parking garage was connected and the blocks are short...not like the long NYC blocks. The hotel is about 5 miles from Citizens Bank Park and in the Arts district where it is clean and safe. As an added bonus, Doubletree is only 1 mile from two of the most famous Philly Cheesesteak places (Pat's and Geno's). Next time I go to Philly I am going to go right for the Doubletree!!!

      "Text: Staying here on business and am impressed by the exceedingly cordial staff. The room itself is nice but not exceptional. I am actually a bit overwhelmed by what I refer to as the \"Alice in Wonderland\" decor - gold and purple walls, green and purple carpet, green doors, high-backed abstractly shaped chairs, etc. It is a bit like something out of Wonderland, although one of my colleagues swears it reminds him of South Beach...The bathroom is non-exceptional - combination shower/tub, nice long counter, and typical lousy hairdryer (I SO wish hotels would give consideration to their female clientele). There are no refrigerators in the rooms, but when I requested one it was promptly brought up for me. The king size bed is comfortable and includes a multitude of pillows of varying firmness and fill. My HVAC unit is on the noisy side (with no option for continuous fan) but this is also not uncommon in older rooms.The breakfast buffet is typically overpriced ($12 for fruit, cereal, pastry, etc.); however, the fresh berries are a nice touch (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries - all available). Again, the service was very attentive. Lastly, on week nights there is Crabby Happy Hour that consists of homemade crab dip and free beer/wine. The crab dip was great (I think that the chef's was good but DJ (?) did a better job by adding mustard for a kick) and made for a super appetizer. \n",

      "Title: “Found my new business hotel in NYC!”\n",
      "Text: After a few not so great experiences at the hotel I normally stay at while in NYC, I took advantage of Jetsetter's sale to obtain a room at the Surrey for an unbeatable rate to see if I should make the Surrey my new business hotel. The first thing that raised my eyebrows about the Surrey was that it doesn't have the same buzz as some of the other hotels in its category such as the Park Plaza, St. Regis or Athenee. However, as I came to find, the Surrey was every bit as luxurious as some of the other boutique hotels but without the crowds and traffic.\n",
      "I will say that I probably won't be booking the Surrey when using Jetsetter again because it was a total logistical nightmare. Normally, with my busy schedule it is very hard to follow up on a hotel booking but it seemed that the Surrey was having some major issues with the Jetsetter site because it took at least 7 emails back and forth with the very helpful GM, Spencer to lock down the day I needed as Jetsetter kept saying it was unavailable and would not show the reservation. I was told there were some issues with the hotel's reservation computer system which might have accounted for the glitch.\n",
      "However, once I actually got to the Surrey, all the hassle I went through making the reservation was worth it. I was upgraded to a fantastic room with a small sitting area and plenty of space. The hotel staff couldn't have been any nicer or friendlier. One of the ways I always judge a hotel is by how the staff treats the guests. From the desk clerks to the doormen to the GM himself, you will be treated as a valued guest here and the staff will go out of the way for you if you make a request.\n",
      "The thing that stood out the most to me was the bed. It was amazing ... without a doubt the best bed I've had at any hotel in NYC. It had extremely nice bedding, including one of the nicest down comforters I've seen ... I forgot to ask where I could buy one when I was checking out of the hotel. I was only there for one night during a worldwind schedule, so its too bad I did not get to use it more. There are plenty of pillows as well, which are not too firm or soft.\n",
      "The room is very tastefully decorated. Normally, I do not love grey, white and black color schemes because I feel they are not very warm and semi-depressing however, the Surrey did it right. The room felt classy and comfortable without feeling too blah. The bathroom was also one of the biggest I've had in NYC with a nice shower that had a great double head and awesome water pressure. The marble and mosaic made it feel very classy. The toiletries were nice and plentiful.\n",
      "One thing I did not use that I thought was cool was instead of the nip-sized bottles in the typical mini-bar ... the Surrey offers bottle service in the room. For $45 - $55 you can buy a 350 ml bottle of liquor (enough for 3-4 drinks) and a bartender will come to your room with the mixers, etc. and mix your first round and leave you the accoutramonts for the other drinks you will make. There are about 15 different drinks you can choose to go with depending on the bottle you choose.\n",
      "The location is great. Those who want to be closer to Broadway/Times Square would not want to walk there and back as it took 30 minutes at a fairly brisk pace to make it to Broadway. It is a short cab-ride to that area and they are pretty good about calling you a cab because this hotel is fairly removed from the action, so cabs aren't plentiful. The location is in a residential part of Central Park. 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue are only a 10 minute walk and because it is so close to Central Park, the walk is not bad. I prefer staying here as opposed to staying more in the 'action' because it is very quiet and laid back ... not at all hustle and bustle. It almost feels like being in a residential neighborhood, which is probably why the price is a bit higher than some comparable hotels.\n",
      "I found the rates to be reasonable ... mid-April seemed to be in the $400 - $500 range for a standard room. You could stay at the W for much less, but I wouldn't say the two are comparable in terms of the luxury bedding/service, however the vibe is similar. One thing I didn't like as much is that if you are traveling with a business partner, they do not have many rooms available at the entry level price range with two beds. I was told upon checking in, the only room they had available with two beds was a junior suite, which would cost $795 per night. The regular rate for an entry level room was $495 at the time.\n",
      "I did not use the restaurant or bar at the hotel. The lobby isn't as spacious as it looks on the website, however it isn't as busy as a lot of other hotels, so that isn't really a problem. I did notice that the staff at this hotel do not beg for tips as they do at a lot of the other full service hotels in the area. At many hotels I stay at for business, it seems like one person takes your bags out of the car, one person wheels them into the hotel, one person parks the car and another person takes the bags to the room. I didn't really find that at the Surrey. I was at the Barclay during this trip as well and was literally chased down into the street by a bellman who moved my bags from my room a few hours earlier who wanted to let me know that it was him that moved my bags earlier that morning.\n",
      "If you have some money to spend and enjoy being outside of the action in a more laid back area, the Surrey is for you. I will say that after several years of staying at their nearby rival hotel, I am making the Surrey my new home for business travel in NYC. I would describe my stay here as luxurious and relaxing and thank the staff and GM for making my business/personal trip so enjoyable.\n",

      "Text: We just got back from our trip to San Diego yesterday. We stayed at the Marriott in the Gaslamp and have nothing but good things to say about this hotel.\n",
      "You really can't beat the location. It is 2 miles to the San Diego Zoo, 5 miles to Sea World, and Petco park is adjacent to the hotel. There are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The Altitude bar on the top of the hotel is great! We could only go up during the day because we had the kids with us, but it overlooks Petco Park so you can watch the game from there. You can also look into the park from the concierge lounge.\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the concierge floor. I am not sure why we were upgraded other than that my husband is a silver (or maybe gold, not sure) Marriott rewards member, but it was a very nice perk. We got free continental breakfasts and h'ordeuvres, free Wifi, and there was a computer and printer in the lounge that came in handy for printing our tickets for our activities. If you are lucky enough to be upgraded, be sure to get a to go container for your breakfast and you can take it up to the Altitude Sky Lounge and eat your breakfast outside.\n",
      "The room was very nice and clean. The kids loved that the turn down service included rock candy and Oreo cookies each day. I am not sure if this is a perk of being upgraded or if they do this for everyone, but the kids loved it! They also had bowls of candy in the lobby. The only drawback to the room was that there was no refrigerator. The hallway carpets were a little on the dingy side, but other than that I was completely happy with the hotel (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl).\n",
      "The staff was super friendly! Everyone we met from the maid to the valet guys were super friendly and helpful. Outstanding service.\n",
      "If you get a chance to go to a Padres game, I highly recommend it. We're not Padre fans, but it was still fun and the tickets are so cheap that we were able to sit in the 8th row. The kids got to meet some of the players and they will sign autographs. The best part was that it's right next to the hotel so there was not fighting traffic. We also went to Heavenly Cupcake for my son's birthday which is just a few blocks from the hotel. They were really good, but a bit pricey. We ate a Bud's one evening and recommend it. If you are on Foursquare you can check in and get free tater tots. There isn't a kids menu, but they did have chicken tenders and sliders and what kid doesn't love tater tots? My husband also recommends the Strip Club which which is a restaurant where you pick out your own steaks and cook the steaks on a grill. We did not do this on this trip, but he was there a few months ago and said it was neat experience and the food was good. We also found a great breakfast/brunch place called Mary Janes. We loved it. I had a great breakfast burrito and the kids enjoyed the bottomless bowl of cereal and Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.\n",

All the equipment was state of the art and included Pilates and Gyrotonic programs. The indoor lap pool was treated with saline instead of chlorine and featured a beautifully serine lounging area. The mens locker room was unparalleled. The staff was very attentive and genuinely interested in making you comfortable in any way possible.

Hotel was very nice and CLEAN and there were many restuarants w/in walking distance. Staff was friendly, helpful and responsive (wasted no time bringing us more towels, etc. upon request). The breakfast according to our sons (10 and 7) was awesome (they are big eaters). The free buffet was pretty much anything you could possibly want for breakfast...the made-to-order omelettes were great (even had egg whites as option). My husband and I thought the breakfast was above average as well. Best of all...they allowed us to keep our car in the garage (pay-to-park reasonable) while we went to the Nat'l Zoo the next day.

We used the toilets downstairs in the lobby for the stinkers. Also the turn down service was great but I question the linen on the floor beside the beds.

There was one tiny ledge that would hold a bar of soap, but otherwise you have to put all your toiletries on the shower floor which means a lot of bending over to pick up bottles. Again, normally not a big deal but the neck injury made it very annoying.\n",
      "Overall, this hotel was everything I was hoping it would be when I booked it and I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in the area. I was comfortable, felt safe, and felt kinda sad when I had to check out.\n",

      "Text: My wife and I stayed @ Humphreys October of 2011. We went to San Diego for a wedding. We stayed a Thursday thru Monday in one of their Grand Marina Suites. The room was fantastic very clean & lots of room. We were on the 2nd. floor great view of the Marina. The hotel is minutes from the airport. Shelter Island is very nice. If you like mexican food go to Miguels mexican restraurant walking distance from the hotel. The hotel also has stage shows. For our stay George Lopez was the entertainment for two nights. If you don't want to spring for the tickets, you can clearly hear the shows from the pool area, just grab a seat and enjoy. We spent one night in the lounge and danced all night with a band that was playing dance music from the 70's & 80's. Both my wife and I give Humphreys two thumbs up.\n",

      "Text: Booked this hotel, being familiar with the Butler Blvd./I-95 area. Turned out to be a great location and a nice, comfortable hotel. Lobby is not the newest fairfield design, but updated and modern with an invitiing feel. Checkin was efficient and friendly. Was pleasantly surprised with the upscale design of the room, especially the bathroom, with nice tile floor and an upscale vanity area. Bed was very comfortaable with two differnet types of pillows. I preferred the fluffier ones. Lighting was another plus, with several fixtures throughout the room on three way switches. Never did get to breakfast, but it looked to be just as nice as the rest of the hotel. \n",

      "Text: I chose the Chelsea Lodge mostly for the price because I was only going to be in NYC one night and just wanted a safe and comfortable place to sleep. I was given a room on the third floor which faced the back of the hotel. The hotel will not guarantee you a specific room but I think it is important to note that my room faced the back because I heard no noise from the street when I went to sleep at night or in the morning. This may not be the case if your room faces the front. The hotel gave me a key to my room and to the front door of the brownstone so I could come and go as I pleased. It felt like coming home at the end of the night. The room had a double bed which was very comfortable for one. I dont know if you book a double if the bed is any bigger. It would have been tight to share that bed with my husband. The room had an open closet for hanging clothes, a dresser, a TV which I never watched, a small desk, a double bed, a small chair, a sink and a shower. The shower had good water pressure and lots of hot water. The room did not get wet when I used the shower as has happened in some hotels I have stayed in. The one thing I felt was missing from the room was a full length mirror (could be put on the back of the door). It would have been nice to help with getting ready to go out. The location of the hotel is ideal. Quick walk to the Village and Midtown. Great access to subways and you can always hop in a cab. The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants and bars and there were lots of people out and about late at night. The hotel is on a treelined side street though so it is quieter. I would definitely recommend this hotel but the rooms ARE small so if two friends are travelling together it woud be best to each get their own room.\n",

When we arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was that the room was small. The queen sized bed took up much of the room. The bathroom was even smaller. The bathroom door could not open all the way because the toilet was in the way. Since this was our first trip to NYC, we were not in our room much. Generally, we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner. The hotel is a very nice hotel. The concierge was great. Meg, was the person we dealt with and she is VERY knowledgeable about everything NYC. The doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi. The room service people were never seen yet every time we came back to our room, everything was cleaned and straightened up. They say, whomever they are, the best way to tell if the hotel was good, is if the people who stayed at the hotel would so again. I would not hesitate to stay there again. It was a great experience.\n",

(St. Regis, Ritz, etc are our norms) We wanted the Tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel (unassuming front) The Bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away. While checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say Happy Anniversary. Being Starwood platinum, we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade. We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before. Now that I know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us, I will go back soon. We go into the city a lot and I will for sure go back!! Thank you so much Sheraton!

Our last stay was at the River Oaks Crowne Plaza in Houston, Texas, and as always, the hotel was there when we needed them.

Mandy, the concierge, was extremely knowledgable concerning local restaurants, shuttles, and even a taxi with comfortable seats and a non smoking atmosphere to take my wife and daughter to the airport only 3 days out of major surgery. We will always seek out a Crowne Plaza to stay at when available, and will always recommend them to friends and family when needing a place to stay.

The hotel was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It looked even better in person than on the hotel website. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our \"partial-oceanview.\" The room was roomy. I wish the beds weren't so high off the ground since I have two young children, but the rooms were beautiful. There was a big flat screen T.V. The sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready. There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing. I found the convenience of the parking well worth the $15. This was such a great value. We would definitely go back in a heart beat.\n",

Not the least expensive spot in town, but I defy you to find a hotel of this caliber that offers suites of this size at lower prices. You won't. Since the hotel is freshly renovated, every inch of the property is spotless & fresh. We had a London Suite on the 17th floor which was silent when the windows were closed. Our suite had a parlor which was separated from the bedroom by a small entryway & a very well-lit bathroom, which was enormous. The huge mirrors on the bathroom wall were separated by fabulous light panels that made makeup application a breeze. In addition, the shower area was ~9' x 4' with a \"rain shower\" type fixture on one end, and a \"shower massage\" fixture on the other. There was also a Euro hand-held fixture, so the bases were covered regarding your showering options. The bed offered super deluxe pillow-top comfort, and the pillows were fab. The linens were very high thread-count sateen. The ambiance is minimalist/elegant in the suites & throughout the hotel. Didn't try the restaurant/bar.

Room 402, was the suite, large bathrooom, no closet space, nice room, fireplace, but the sofa bed was terrible.

Room 402 did have a view, they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night. Did not asked for a discount; they told me to contact Manager who was unable at the time each time I inquired. The Corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not (may be the government rate). The coffee in the morning was great; did not attend the wine party. Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great. If you book a room, asked for the courtyard view if possibe. Location is everything at this site; everything you need is right in the area. Pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance. Do you go the aquarium; not worth the price.\n",

Surprisingly, it was a king room with a sofa bed. Pretty sure that's what I asked for in the first place, but whatever. It was a corner room with views of the river and it was literally the most amazing view. That view was almost worth the troubles. Except at 2:00 am this A/C unit started making the very same noise.

As a family of five travelling from Australia, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Handlery. We had a corner 'family suite' in the front older part of the hotel which had plenty of room for us and all of our luggage. The smaller room held a double (or queen?) bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed. With the sofa away, we had a large lounge area with coffee table - perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of San Franciso.\n",
      "This kids also enjoyed the pool - which was outdoors but heated. Nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food, including a Walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies (there was a fridge in the kids room). The Irish pub next door has a fantastic dinner buffet, and the bar around the corner has a champagne happy hour and live music (for Mum & Dad's time out).\n",
      "My tip for family's is to use the BART to travel back to the airport. We easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us (yes 7) to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean BART train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus. More money to spend in the wonderful shops in Chinatown!\n",

Well, that's exactly what happened and we ended up stay at this hidden little paradise instead of winging it and spending the night at a motel. Quite honestly, probably the best decision we made. The check in process at Kona Kai was quick, we were charged a decent amount for parking, and the rest was beautiful, beautiful experience.\n",

We open up the two doors and it opened right up to the beach. The most gorgeous views, and Kona Kai played it RIGHT! I loved how humble the room came off as, while boasting such a beautiful property. There was a big, sparkling pool next to a great little hot jacuzzi.\n",

      "Text: Visiting Philadelphia on leisure for two days and two nights, my wife and I elected to stay at the Sofitel based on the positive reviews on this and other websites. We were not disappointed. Paying only a little above $200 per night, we got a very spacious suite - a corner one at that - and the experience was impressive in every aspect. The service was friendly, professional, and efficient. The valet parking (which cost us a mere $30 total) meant that our car was ready at the door when we wanted it, and upon arriving back at the hotel, we could just get out of the car and go back to our room. Very convenient. The decoration and styling of the hotel is not as \"gaudy\" and \"florid\" as some other high-end brands, but the look is very elegant, modern, and artistic no less. You might call it luxury without ostentation. The suite was most accomodating in every way, from the numerous spacious closets, to the heavenly comofortable bed, to the well-stocked refrigerator bar, and the wall finishings and all the furniture. Oh, and the bathroom - extremely impressive. It was tremendous, with two sinks, a comfortable bath, and a spacious shower. If I had to find anything to quibble about, I could say that the wireless internet should have been free rather than $10/day (though I was able to get a free signal from a nearby hotel....), and it would be nice if the bathroom would have a jacuzzi rather than a plain bathtub (though strictly speaking, it was actually a \"Jacuzzi\" brand bathtub, but anyway....). Can't speak for the bar/restaurant as we did not partake. Don't forget to bring cash to tip the valets, room service, and bellhops! All in all you can't go wrong with this hotel, certainly at the price we paid. Strongly recommended. We would easily stay there again.\n",

      "From the outside, The Eldon, has a historic facade which is very Washingtonian. The inside however is a totally different story in itself! The hallways boast very luxurious marble floors and walls. There is a unique set of glass artwork on every floor and the lobby has soothing spa-like music to really help you relax the moment you walk in. Did I mention checking in was a snap? The front desk staff were very friendly and more than willing to go over and above to help us with finding our way around, helping us with our bags (Great personal service that you'd only find at small hotels). The concierge there, Vinh, is exceptional. He has first hand experience of the area being a DC native and recommended to us some local favorites like Marrakesh (7-course Morrocan dinner with live belly dancer), Phillips (all you can eat seafood right by the waterfront).\n",
      "The designers spared no expense in making you feel very pampered. The trend of marble floors and artwork continue onward into the Guest Rooms themselves. The furnishings have a very modern and contemporary flare. The rooms are bright, spacious, and luxurious. My girlfriend loved sleeping on the down pillows/comforter. The hotel provides guests with bathroom amenities from L'Occitane, a very high end french brand. The showers themselves are state of the art with a massaging jet function, a real treat at the end of the day of sight seeing!\n",
      "There is a complimentary continental breakfast served every morning in the lounge area across from the lobby with very lovely pastries (the cherry filled danishes were my favorite). There is also a fitness center on the rooftop with a breathtaking view of the city. We didn't have time for it this trip, but we were up there to look at the facility/views. \n",
      "I am not sure what else to add. The Eldon has everything you want while visiting DC. Complimentary Wi-Fi in the rooms. Great location to downtown/national mall. Metro accessible. Located on the same block to a CVS and 3 blocks from a Safeway. A friendly and personable staff that is willing to serve you and make you happy. In room spa services. The Eldon made our first trip to DC a memorable one that we won't soon forget. \n",

The Hotel is situated somewhat perpendicular to the river; So from your river view room you Look down the river as it opens out on the lake gives you such a unique feel to Chicago. Especially at sunrise and sunset. The way the light plays along the streets, river makes it seem as if Chicago has laid a golden carpet out you and only you....and that the city is yours for the taking. I think this is by far this Hotels top selling point. \n",

I got a Deluxe room ( with two queen beds and river view) for 227/ night during the last week in August. The room was Clean, appeared freshly renovated, more spacious than I expected. I think the catch was that it was a Physically impaired (disabled) -accessible room... but dont let that fool you. You could hardly notice the modifications. Contemporary styling keeps the bars looking as if they are just part of the decor and I did not note this until I was checking out. \n",

Ahh heaven. \n",

Valet parking is a little pricey too. Other hotels in the area Charges 15/over night stay. Wish there was an option for paid self park at their parking structure but it wasn't too bad to valet. The valet attendants were really nice and gave good directions on getting around town. And it doesn't hurt that they're very easy on they eyes ;)\n",

Quirky decorations and a stylish lobby are great but since I'm not living there I can live without them. If you're like me then this hotel really hovers somewhere between 3 and 4 circles- if you are in to the boutique thing then this is a 4-circle hotel for sure.\n",

This room inspired the punchchline \"when I put the key in the front door I broke the back window.\" They have a desk but the TV is mounted right above it so while I like working with the TV on I don't get into the front row movie theater experience and so couldn't do without resorting to sitting on the bed.

I have actually never had that added to my bill for a buffet breakfast at any other hotel in the United States (I was a party of 1). Plus 20% for almost no service (it's a buffet, people!). But I realize that some people tip the guy at McDonald's for handing them their food so for those people I'm sure this would be a non-issue. \n",

The bath products are either Aveda or Italian and when you have a soaking tub they leave you salts, The soaking tubs are so worth the room upgrade but all of the bathrooms are top-notch. I have not had an inside room which might be a bit claustrophobic but the lobby lounge is a comfortable hangout spot with a giant wooden table and comfy chairs. I have also dined at the in-house restaurant Print and the food is consistently delicious. The Press Lounge is a great place for a drink while you soak in the city views. The staff are attentive and respectful - I truly feel like Ink48 is my second home! The only draw back is there is not a subway stop close by but the walking feels great!\n",

      "Text: My 16 yr. old daughter and I spent 5 nights here and loved it! Very conveniently located for Soho shopping, Little Italy, and China Town. It was great to walk out the hotel door and be right where you wanted to be. We found the hotel to be clean, and all the staff we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. We did have an issue with the television, we called the front desk and they sent an engineer to our room, and it was fixed within 15 minutes. The room service breakfast was very good. However, I can't say the same for the burger i had ordered. The burger was a very thick one, and that is okay, but it was way over cooked and very dry; it was a total waste of money. We were on the 11th floor across from the elevators. We could hear the subway, but could not feel it, it really didn't bother us all that much. Another reviewer mentioned that Little Italy was disappointing. Well, it is only two blocks these days as China Town is taking over. The two blocks of Little Italy are great, the only disappointment is that there is not more of it. The taxi ride, with tip, to Time Square ranged from $16-$20 if you are wondering. Well, we had a great time, loved the hotel, staff, and location. Yes, the room was a bit small, but I understand this is normal in NYC. Besides, we were hardly in it for any length of time other than sleeping. This was our first trip to NYC, and we will definately be returning and staying at this hotel!\n",

You can really hear the people walk around and roll luggage on the floor above you pretty clearly. The nice big tvs in the rooms had a shelf near it that looked convenient if I had brought a video game console. However from what I could tell, there were only had composite video inputs and not the hdmi I would have preferred. Also, the hd channels on the tv weren't on the hotel provided channel listings, but were there way past of all the other sd channels and seemed to be a pretty random selection of what was there. The shower was designed to not need any sort of curtain or door, but it seemed to me that to make it work and not get water all over the bathroom the shower head was pointed towards a corner and was not adjustable at all. That made the very roomy shower seem kinda cramped as I had to huddle in the corner of the shower to stay in the water flow.\n",

Too bad when the mini-bar selection is not great, and there is a Dean and Deluca one block away.

There are no deadlocks on the doors to prevent little ones from exiting the room. Since the two sleeping areas are on opposite ends of the suite, separated by a bathroom and if parents are in sound sleep from a day of exploring, they might not hear if an early riser child should get inquisitive and head out! Since our 5 year old is on the Sprectrum, this created some anxiety about sleeping arrangements. The resort (hotel) is outstanding but this glitch could be fixed easily and without a lot of cost.\n",

First I booked thru Hotwire and I got a ridiculously low rate which is really great for me but for the first time i felt like a second class guest here. Why? First, the room they gave us was nice at first glance but upon closer scrutiny there were minor problems like the shower head was defective, the toilet had a leak, and the knob in one of the lampshades was missing. Second the location was right in front of the tracks so if you are a light sleeper then better bring some earplugs. Third we stayed for 6 days and upon checking in I requested for a fridge since I had my family with me. They told me that they will bring it to my room as soon as it becomes available. It never came although the rooms next to us received theirs even if I came earlier. I know what I am talking about because I saw the refrigerators out side the rooms near us. Lastly there were 3 occassions that I had to call the cleaning ladies attention with regards to our daily supply of toiletries which she forgot. I have been using Hotwire for the past couple of years and never has this happened to me. I was always treated as if I was a regular paying guest. Anyway as I've said, this is not a complaint just an observation. If someone asks me if I would like to stay again at the Hilton Gaslamp I would definitely say yes. The location is fantastic, the front desk staff were friendly, and the ambiance was terrific. I've stayed in 4-5 stars hotel in San Diego since 2003 and I have to admit this is the best. The issues I raised did not really bother us for we were always out enjoying San Diego. Lastly, will I still patronize Hotwire? You bet I will. I hope this becomes a wake up call for both Hotwire and the Hilton.\n",

      "Text: Our experience at Aloft Harlem began unpleasantly: after finding a low rate on Expedia, we attempted to take advantage of the \"low price guarantee\" advertised by Starwood, the company behind the Aloft brand. Except that after filling forms and providing information, we received a dry email informing us that the request has been rejected. The reason: Starwood could not verify the lower price on Expedia. And why would they, considering that they waited 48 hours before checking, at which point the sale was over?\n",
      "So we didn't receive the price guarantee, but that didn't dampen our pleasure at Aloft Harlem. A testament to the gentrification of the neighborhood, the hotel is as stylish as any other in the chain, but the service is what sets it apart. And that's quite an achievement. Anyone we met - anyone - was friendly, thoughtful and accommodating. From the receptionist who initiated changing our room to a quiet one, even before we had the wits to ask, to the chambermaid who suggested convenient time to come by.\n",
      "So something in Starwood works right, if not in the reservation department than certainly in training and standards. If this property continue to shine on service, it'll be an exceptional one.\n",

All of the recommended reviews for this hotel were on the money. The few negative comments about construction and customer service issues are outdated now and this is the place to go. The drive to downtown was exceptionally easy and it felt good to get away from all of the business of downtown after we were finished for the day. The 42\" flat screen, room decor, pillows, beds, lobby area, business center etc. are next to impossible to beat. The best item was the lounge sofa with pull out bed in the room which made relaxing and watching the HDTV absolutely fantastic. \n",
      "I have never signed up for reward points with any hotel chain. This time I did. Hyatt Place has a tagline \"It's So You\". In my case that was totally true. If you can get a discounted rate for the weekend etc. for $99 - $109 you just gave yourself a true treat.\n",

      "Text: We arrived as a family of four from Scotland Friday 2nd November. We had tried all week to get a proper update on what we were coming to and were not clear as information from both the Hilton group and Expedia was very limited. After saving hard all year for this holiday we decided to go for it. We arrived to find the hotel in complete darkness and were met by Jatin the hotel manager. I have to say that he became our guardian angel and allayed any fears we may have had. Jatin took control for us and tried to contact Expedia on our behalf to see what alternative arrangements could be made. This is when things got difficult as the silence from expedia was deafening. Jatin explained that our only option was to stay that night and if the power did not come on then he would look at other options for us. Thankfully the power came on at 5am and we were good to go. Thereafter we could not have been in a better hotel, location and with excellent staff all round it ended up a fantastic holiday. The hotel and staff cater for your every need and nothing is to much trouble. The room was on the small side but very comfortable. the breakfast and the all day coffee were excellent and there was always something that you could eat and cookies in the afternoon were a nice touch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definatley stay here again as the value for money is there for all to see. Once again a massive thankyou to Jatin and his excellent team.\n",

      "Text: I normally don't bother with reviews but this stay I felt needed one. I always check out trip advisor reviews before booking with a hotel and they have never steered me wrong. However, this hotel was a huge disappointment. I usually take the bad reviews with a grain of salt if there are numerous good reviews. Well, I should have listened to the bad this time. First off, all staff that I encountered (except for a young lady that had only been there 4 months) were rude. We booked through expedia which advertised \"free shuttle, free continental breakfast\" at a special rate (which was $3 less than the sign outside the hotel when we arrived). We were given a room on the ground floor on a saturday night at about 8pm. We were surprised at the amount of people out in the halls and outside but we figured it would calm down. No such luck...folks were making all kinds of noise all throughout the night. There were a lot of young couples making out in the parking lot and with the mirror over our bed and the extremely small room, it made me wonder if there aren't a lot of \"hourly\" stays here. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and with all the noise, we were not able to sleep one wink. the small uncomfortable room with the hard bed did look clean but there was something splattered all over the mirror headboard (like soda or food or something) that made me wonder if they really cleaned the rooms ever. We were only staying for one night so we could leave the next morning for a flight to disney world. When we checked in we told the girl that we had requested the shuttle service for 7am. She said ok and wrote our names on some sort of list- not a problem. Also asked what we would have to do to get the shuttle back to the hotel and she replied- just call the hotel and we'll take care of it. Ok. Well, the next morning no one was at the front desk...we later found out he was the one setting up breakfast. When I asked him about the shuttle, he did come out and call the driver to wake him up. I also asked him if we just called them or how the process worked to get picked up. He said to just call. He was very short with everyone he spoke to. He was very strange (can't describe him) Anyway, there were 5 of us already out there waiting for him (he was supposed to be out there at 7am). The driver finally showed up at 7:30 to give us a ride (pretty darn tired looking). He must have also not gotten any rest from all the partying going on in the halls the night before. Anyway, we got the ride to the airport and there were no lines so no problems getting to our 9:30 flight on time. The real problem was when we returned. I called the hotel to get the shuttle back to where my van was parked. All of a sudden they have no record of me even staying there. Then the lady on the phone finally finds it and says \"oh, you booked through expedia so you shouldn't have been allowed to park and shuttle without upgrading to our price\" She also called my price \"extremely discounted\" even though it was only $3 less than the advertised price on their signage and it was I am pretty sure the crappiest room they had available. After hearing I might have to pay double what I paid to get back to my van which was already parked at the hotel, you can imagine I was pretty irrate. So I did mention to her that I got a discounted rate for a crappy room. She insisted that I had to pay the fee that the 2 employees before should have mentioned to me and made me pay before I left my van there. She asked that I pay that fee when I got back to the hotel and since I finally agreed, she did go ahead and have the shuttle man pick me up since he was already there picking up another couple. But she was pretty rude about it. Also, if you have small children you should know that the shuttle is more of a small minivan. I didn't think to bring a car seat for my two year old son bc I didn' know this. Next time I will ask the hotel what kind of shuttle. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend staying here at all but if you still decide to...just know that you will probably pay way more money than advertised. I watched a couple check in that morning and the cost ended up being $70 without any kind of park and ride service. The sign outside advertised $49.99 but with taxes and fees the front desk guy told them it was $70. Anyway, this review may not sound too bad to some and I guess I should have known better than to try to save a little money. However, after these reviews I felt like it would be a good place to stay for one night. Boy was I wrong. Nothing was as advertised and how can it be a good place for one night when everyone is making noise all night? No consideration at all. It was a horrible way to start our vacation...I should have just waken up at my house at 3am and driven 3 hrs to the aiport myself...it would have been better than paying for this hotel and not even getting to sleep there. Just not good experiences...I just want to save others from having similar experiences. Oh and the lady that made me pay extra was dissing expedia like crazy and I have always booked through them with no problems whatsoever. On the positive side, since we were standing in the lobby for 30 minutes waiting for the driver of the shuttle bus...I did manage to get a bagel to eat and get some fruit loops and juice for my son. The breakfast didn't start until 7 (a little after) though on the weekends. I'm wondering if those folks with good reviews stayed during the weekday and if that makes a difference. Maybe an upper level larger room, I don't know. But I will say that when we got there I kind of felt like the lady who wrote she didn't feel safe in this hotel. It was just the people hanging out in the hallway and the sketchy people walking up and down the road around the hotels. I kinda wondered if my van would be safe but the front desk lady just said not to leave anything valuable in it and that they hadn't had to call the cops for any incidents in about 4 months....\n",

We got a two-bedroom suite and I was worried as we were right next to the pool, but we never heard any noise from that area. The rooms were clean and well-appointed, the beds were very comfortable, and we loved having the kitchen for meals and heating up leftovers. The breakfasts were very hearty, which kept us from buying too much expensive food right off the bat at SeaWorld. And one day we had the afternoon meal, which saved us some more money. We were just a few minutes drive from the park, which meant we did not have to deal with long rides in the car (and it was super hot, so this was really good) or any traffic. I thought this hotel was an excellent value and we will definitely use it again when we go to visit SeaWorld.\n",

      "Text: We booked our New York vacation through Air MIles and after considering a couple of options decided on The New Yorker. We were not disappointed. This is a great hotel with small but comfortable rooms and great security. For $10 a night we upgraded to a room-with-a-view and it was worth every penny. We were in a corner room and out of one window had a view of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State building a few blocks away and Penn Station and Madison Square Garden just below. Out of the other window we had a partial view of the Hudson River and all the buildings north of the hotel. It seems like a small thing but there's something magical about being able to look out over the city at night. The lighting on the Empire State Building changes from time to time. It was green for St. Patrick's Day. The great thing about The New Yorker is that its within walking distance of many local attractions - Times Square, Broadway, St. Patrick's Cathedral, The Rockefeller Centre, MoMA, 5th Avenue. If you're ambitious you can even walk to the 9-11 Memorial (about 2 miles) and Central Park. There are many excellent restaurants in the area and it's an easy walk to local favourites like Grimaldi Pizza and Brooklyn Bagels. The Chinese restaurant just a block away, Chef Yu, was excellent. For a great lunch take the subway down to 369 Broome Street for a sub sandwich at Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich. One of the best meals all week was the Thai dinner we ate at Bangkok House, 360 West 46th, just a healthy walk from the hotel. The bed in our room was extremely comfortable and after walking miles every day we slept well. The housekeeping service was good - almost too good - as sheets and towels were changed even when they didn't need to be. The smallness of the room wasn't a factor most of the time, but the absence of a second chair meant that one of us had to sit on the bed while watching television (rare) or using the hotel's free internet. The free internet tended to be a little slow but we decided against the upgrade to premium internet for around $10 per day. The souvenir shop in the basement of the hotel was well stocked and reasonably priced. If you're considering taking a double-decker bus tour the consensus seemed to be that the Gray Line is more reliable than the City Sights competitor. We had pre-booked with City Sights and overall it was pretty good. However, one afternoon on the Uptown Tour, we hopped off at the Metropolitan Museum and never did hop back on. Every bus that came by was full with others who had hopped back on. There were about ten very tired and frustrated people still waiting when we decided to take a cab back to our hotel. Anyway, it was a fabulous week and having a great, comfortable hotel like The New Yorker as our home base had a lot to do with making this the vacation of a lifetime.\n",

We booked five nights and were contacted ahead of our stay by Mrs. Avellana, the \"Loyalty Ambassador\". She wanted to make sure that we have a pleasant stay, and we did. Gorgeous quiet and clean corner room with plenty of views. The staff service was outstanding, from checkin to departure. High notes for housekeeping and room service. We tried the restaurant several times, and the food and service were outstanding - try the smoked salmon flatbread for a breakfast change (the buffet is great, too). Location cannot be beaten. The only thing to improve: Wireless internet connection on floor 24 war bad to nonexistent, we were never able to connect to the Omni router (extremly weak signal) and used our wireless broadband card instead without any problems. vWe`ll be back soon!

There was confusion about the charge for parking but the front desk made that right. The room was comfortable and the living room concept--snacks in each wing of the complex is a great idea. The early morning shuttle was on time, the to go box breakfast for my daughter was waiting as promised. My wife and I enjoyed the free breakfast and the surroundings before departure.

We went back to reception and were assured an upgrade in light of this, so we went to a smaller room with a smaller bed! This was unacceptable, so we went back to reception again! This time we were given a large suite of two room size and were then informed that there was no water on our floor due to maintenance. (actually we were told it was the whole of midtown without water, even though the water was working elsewhere in the hotel)I must say we were offered compensation for no water, a voucher for their own spa at a value that meant you had to spend more, unreal.\n",

Had I had to pay for that meal there I would have been very angry at the state of the food for the cost.\n",

A small TV, microwave, refrigerator and hot pot were in a corner of the room. The bathroom had clearly been renovated but had some cracks in the tile and water damage by the window. Back in 1918 there weren't any showers so they had to put the shower head in an odd place when renovating. \n",

      "The check-in was done by a friendly and attentive receptionist. Our room was available straight away. The check-in desk is on the first floor but there are lifts and these were working great and fast during the whole week. I asked for a goldfish to be sent to my room (it's something special they do for people who miss their pets back home). The next morning, I found a big bowl with a cute goldfish (it is fed and cleaned by the staff).\n",
      "The room was a little bit on the small size but considering it is New York City it is reasonable (I have been in smaller rooms). It is elegantly decorated: sleek & modern with a retro feel to it (check the towel rack & sink in the bathroom, very Art Deco). There was a small walk-in closet (with mirrors, it reminded me of the Orient Express) and a sort of tall boy so there was plenty of room to put all our clothes and hide our suitcases in the \"closet\". \n",
      "The bed was not big but it was comfortable. I always find beds too small as I have a king size bed at home, it is hard to go smaller! There was an ipod alarm clock (it charged my ipod nano), a flat tv screen, a dvd player, a phone and an iron/ironing board. The bathroom was small as well but there was a decent bath/shower and space to put your toiletries.\n",
      "The lovely touches were numerous so among those I enjoyed: the most: the goldfish, free wi-fi, free apples, magazines & coffee machines on every floor, the decor (trendy with a retro feel) and my favourite: a decent list of dvds to borrow and watch in your room (complimentary).\n",
      "The staff is extremely efficient (in all categories) without being obstrusive, which means that they were always polite, very helpful and friendly but they keep it professional.

      "No great view but i wasn't there to sit and look out of the window, there was a desk which i used as a dressing table, not a massive amount of space to put things in the bathroom but seriously we were there for 4 nights so there was enough room for what we needed. Just a shower, no bath but that was hot and good pressure.\n",
      "A safe in the wardrobe and about 20 hangers for the two of us, there were three drawers either side of the massive comfortable bed which again for 4 nights was perfectly adaquate for what we needed.\n",
      "The TV was large and had the usual channels, we managed to watch a film on ABC or something like that and you can pay extra for new films etc if you wanted too (not too sure how much they are). The mini bar is motion sensitive and that includes the things on top so i would recommend not touching any of it.\n",
      "The coffee/tea mmmmm well not too great to be honest, you have to make one cup at a time and there is only creamer and sweetners in the little packet so not too good but if black coffee if your thing then all good.\n",
      "You can have laundry, room service wake up calls etc etc the usual staff.\n",
      "The only small thing was one day after the room being cleaned they left a glass of water next to the bed and didn't empty one of the bins but that was it, you can have your towels and sheets changed as often as you like.\n",
      "Location - Could not do better, if you come out of the hotel and turn left within about a 1 minute stroll you are in the centre of time squares all the lights etc etc are there right in front of you. If you then turn left of right you are on broadway..\n",
      "If you turn right out of the hotel and walk two blocks you are on fifth ave, this is about a 3 - 4 minute stroll away. Central park is just passed Tiffany's and takes about a 15-20 minute stroll, empire state is about 10 -15 minute stroll with a pass by Macy's.\n",
      "Everthing is walking distance and if not for you the main bus terminal is 5 minute walk. Nearest subway is no more than 5 minutes walk.\n",
      "The Restaurant right next to the hotel you can charge to your room, we had breakfast there and it was about $45 for two of us for breakfast, juice, toast & Coffee. \n",
      "Overall the best decision i have made on a hotel. To give you an idea i stay in 5 star hotels generally but in a city a 4 star as you don't spend any time there, we were out by 9am and not back until 12am or a quick pop i for shower and change. A clean, friendly and lovely hotel, don't waste money on others for a fancy entrance with a man on the door as they are not worth it.\n",

This is my 11th consecutive year as a Starwood Platinum Member and in all that time I have only been inspired on three other occasions to write a review of a property. Therefore I am honored to write this review to make known my gratefulness for you're Staff providing such an exceptional experience at my recent stay at your Property. I had the opportunity to thank Maricora earlier for her role in providing exceptional service upon check-in. I appreciated your Team's hospitality, the room upgrade's, the early check-in, the late check-out, and the overall warmth and personal care your property extended to my Guest's and I. \n",
      "To my Peer's here on Trip Advisor please know that when your travel calls for you to be in Downtown Los Angeles don't spend hundred of dollars a night to stay in some over-rated property! The Sheraton is inexpensive, (I booked my nights for only $159 a night and about $200 less then some of the other swanky hotels that don't come close to offering the warmth, charm, and value I found here at this property!) For those with access to it the Concierge Lounge was excellent! A perfect place to unwind and get some work done with free refreshments and scrumptious appetizers. The location is perfect! Close to everything! The property is clean and warm and very cheerful. Every staff member that I encountered was authentically concerned about our comfort and enjoyment. They really want to make sure your experience is memorable. We took advantage of ordering some room service and were completely satisfied. The food arrived hot and tasty! In under 20 minutes!!! The hotel was immaculate and felt very cozy. The beds were a dream! (pun intended) The rooms were clean as a whistle and the bathroom was luxurious! \n",
      "I have informed Daniel Kerzner as he is the Director of the Starwood Ambassador Program and He should know I recommend he send his VIP Guests to stay under your care. I have also shared my gratitude with Tanja at Starwood Corporate as she is my Personal Travel Ambassador and her Manager, Laurie McBeath. They ask me to provide details whenever I encounter a truly exceptional experience that goes above and beyond the normal high standards Starwood sets for it's guests and you are without question the example they had in mind.  In the words of one of your most famous Govenors, \"I'll be back\"! \n",

      "Text: This is a pretty good hotel located in San Diego's Hotel Circle. We were there for a group event so our pricing per night was almost half of what was listed on their web page. The hotel is older but seemed to be kept up pretty well. Several nicks and scratches on the furniture but nothing terrible. The bathrooms were older but kept clean and updated the best that they could without a complete overhaul. Ask for a balcany room overlooking the pool for the best experience. If you don't ask, you probably won't get. Checked in early, around 12:30PM with no problem. On Saturday evening they set up a large movie screen by the pool and showed the movie \"Scooby Doo\". Several families were down at the pool sitting in lounge chairs enjoying the movie. It was kinda neat. The only thing is, is that if your room overlooked the pool, you could hear the movie with the sliding door open. But it was shown early enough in the evening that it wasn't an annoyance. The hotel circle area has many mid-range hotels to choose from and this one is pretty good size and probably my favorite right now. The only sad thing about the area is that, with all the hotels, there are few in any restaurants. I guess the hotels want you to eat at their hotels but haven't been lucky enough to eat at a good one there. All in all, not bad.\n",

So they could describe me and reception did know who I was. The spa reception excused because they did not know my name. I said that I liked the service a lot as they knew me. All the staff know you immediately. For example when we had breakfast on our second day the lady in the restaurant knew what we ordered the day before.

      "Text: This is the second time we've stayed at the Soho Grand, both times for long weekends in New York. I love the location, right on the doorstep of Soho's fabulous shopping district. The staff are slightly aloof but friendly enough, the service in the overpriced restaurant is inexplicably slow but for location it can't be beaten. Ask for a room on a high floor - we asked for a 'room with a view' and ended up on the 16th floor with a breathtaking view of the Cast Iron district with the Empire State Building in the distance. The place could do with a lick of paint but when you're chilling in the bar with a cocktail and people-watching, you can forgive the Soho Grand's minor faults.\n",

That the pool shut down at 6 PM was a bit disappointing but not the end of the world - there is more than enough to do in Manhattan.

Staying in Philadelphia proper is too far away (due to traffic), and to get to UPenn graduation sites quickly, this is the hotel to choose. But that’s the only reason. During Graduation Week, the hotel doubles its prices. This is a complete rip-off. The rooms are smallish and while the beds are good to sleep in, the wood frames have sharp corners that are unfortunately very hard to avoid and painful to encounter. The closets are tiny and about four hangers are provided. The bathrooms: we had a King bed room, which had a large shower. The door only opened out, so that after leaving the shower, the bathroom floor flooded, with water dripping down the door. We changed to a room with a tub/shower, but those rooms do not have King beds. There is only one sink. Worst of all, the walls are thin as paper. The entertainment is constant. We were treated to the sounds of our neighbors talking on the phone, using the bathroom, having friends over till late at night, fighting, making up….and the only thing we were not treated to were the sounds of silence. Parking costs $39 per night. Our car is parked on the street outside of the hotel (yes, we are still here while I am writing this). We are told that there is Security watching the cars. Right. The housekeeping has been good on some days, and for the past two days has been lousy. I hate having to call up for missing items and then having to tip the person bringing those items, when they should have been in the room in the first place. Breakfast (at $40/pp) has been decent but not worth the price. Thank goodness our son graduated. This is not a hotel we would ever stay at again. Give me The Rittenhouse any day, even if it is not near the University (and if only they had had rooms available). Oh, and by the way, that IPad? Nothing but a useless gimmick.\n",

      "Text: I would agree with most of the comments here: nice brand new hotel, very nice rooms/decor, great location, staff at check in very friendly and welcoming. My problem occurred after checking out when I went to pick up my car at the recommended lot. Despite my reservation confirmation, which indicated a reduced parking fee of $30, and the website which says parking is $30, the garage charged me $40. They said my car was \"over-sized\". I went back to the hotel to question it and Alex at the desk said \"we have no control over what the garage does\". Although I might disagree with that notion, I did not argue, just asked that a manager call me the next day. It took a call to Holiday Inn Guest relations 2 days later before I received a call from the hotel management. I explained the situation, and received the same response that Alex gave: “we have no control over what the garage does\"; in addition, I was told that \"you would pay much more if we didn't negotiate a discounted rate\". No apology for any misunderstanding, no apology for the website being inaccurate. \n",
      "Honestly, not looking for $10, not looking for anything, but confirmation that the garage was not gouging, or acknowledgement that the hotel information should be more accurate. I simply said that the website and confirmation should be accurate; if you charge more for over size vehicles, just have the website say it. The manager did not say \"we'll address that\", he said \"we'll look into it\" \n",
      "On Sunday upon check out, I didn't know if the garage was ripping me off for $10; the good news is, they were not. The bad news is, as a well located hotel in NYC, I was left with the feeling that this hotel doesn't care about loyal Holiday Inn guests (I am a Gold Priority Club member).\n",

Then, Mon - Thurs, you get a cocktail hour of beer and wine and snacks, and mini-dinner in case you don't want to go out. But way more better than all of that is, dumb me, I forgot stuff in the room, and I called, and it was there, they found it, and they sent it to me! The staff is great, so helpful, and so un-uptight! Oh, and be sure to note that they have a shopping service, and it is free! All you pay for is the product you want. They leave the receipts on the table and the stuff in your fridge. If I was running a hotel business this is the way I would run it. I'd really like to hide this place so that I can stay there next year, but people that travel to Denver a lot should really take note!

When we were staying the (small) swimming pool was freezing to the point of being useless - hopefully that's fixed now and it's not meant to be unheated. We enjoyed our brief time here very much in the summer, but can see why it may not ideal when the temperature drops, the harbor gets too choppy to enjoy the water taxis and the sun isn't there to show Boston off at its best.\n",

Rooms are quirky with a vanity sink and mirror actually in the room and a semi-opaque shower, which might not be to everyone's liking? Beds are superb as always, so comfortable.

Great potential, a lot of great music history but it is all going to get lost in the crime. We stayed at the Hampton Inn there on Peabody, around the corner from Beale st. Lesson learned, many say why get a room that is expensive, all you do is sleep there. The room can make or break the vacation. It was very noisy, some of it seemed under construction. Recommend you spend a few extra and stay at the Peabody Hotel beautiful place we had dinner there 2 nights. Visited Grace land. Very nice, but growing up with Elvis also very sad.

Room nicely equipped - even had toothpaste and upscale bath toiletries.\n",

Well - not really... headed up to my room at 11:30 to use the restroom and my key would not work. Thought I had the wrong room... but another guest answered. Even though I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" insert in the key slot - the maids must have entered the room without consulting the late check-out list, saw the room was empty, reported it vacated, and cleaned it in record time. Glad I wasn't in the shower.... Really - there wasn't that long between my trips to the room to accomplish all that plus get another person check-in to the room... wow... When I told the front desk, they apologized and offered me another room. I declined the new room - thought it was a waste, but the whole thing irritated me. \n",
      "The other quirk is the the statement. Upon check-in - they ask if you would like your final bill emailed to you. This was a new to me. So, if you say yes, you do not get a bill under the door (not sure if they do this at all anyway), It has been more that 24 hours and I still do not have an invoice - which I need to file my expenses. I had to call - they instruct you to go on-line and through a series of \"clicks\" request a copy of your statement - says it can take up to 48 hours. Normally, I would not leave without a bill.

After our room service meal was delivered, we had to call back for them to deliver cream for the coffee and silverware! Needless to say by the time they came back, the rest of the meal was cold. They only had one person bartending and waitressing in the afternoon. No fault to this lonely employee who was trying to serve everyone to the best of their ability, but was not able to provide prompt service. Aside from the service, there was mold growing on the bathtub tiles. I was interested to see if they would clean it the next day (which they did not). The maid service also knocked on the door and asked if we we \"needed anything\". I thought daily cleaning was the norm for Marriott and it was not necessary to request this service. The computer area for business and customer use was at the junction of two hallways with alot of noise and traffic. The computer was also facing the center of the room making everything on the screen visible to the other people standing around.

We also were apparently placed in a room adjacent to a store-room of some sort, and so at various intervals during all times of night and day, the wall our bed's headboard was against would shake with the loud sounds of equipment being moved or stored.

This is now our family vacation destination because of price and distance we will definitely be back.\n",

I walked around town and found and booked this place because it was the cheapest and they let us check in early. Only later did I find out this was the old KINGS COURT!!! I took our key and made my way towards our building expecting the worst. But the hotel is fully renovated. Everything worked including the TV. The staff were good not exceptional but hey this is not a 5 star place. The room was clean, bed linen and towels were all clean. For the price you cant go wrong in Memphis.\n",

There was also one waitress who disappointed with her cool attitude.\n",

Best bet is to be dropped off or find another way here and forget the car. \n",

Our room was really nice. We stayed there three years ago, and I could tell that our room had been updated since then. I think the furniture was the same, but it appeared to have new carpet and the bathroom vanity area appeared newer. It was very clean too. Wore white socks around the room the first night and couldn't see anything on the bottoms. The tub/toilet area of the bathroom is not fancy. Just a simple tub and toilet. If you are expecting glass shower surrounds and seperate tub and shower area, you might want to look elsewhere. Our room was on the ground floor of a two-storied building and was SUPER quiet. We could only hear our neighbors when they were coming in their door from the outside. We could hear our upstairs neighbors walking around occassionally, but overall...probably one of the quietest we have ever stayed in. Room was a great size for our family of 5.

      "Text: My 4 night stay at the Hotel Rex exceeded all expectations. Here is the lowdown:\n",
      "Location - Perfect. The Rex is close to the Theater District and Union Square, but remote enough so that you don't feel like a tourist. Access to cable cars and buses is great. All major downtown sights are an easy walk. Also, the Bart trains are not far; if you don't mind walking 4 blocks and don't have a ton of luggage, I recommend using Bart to get to the Rex from the airport.\n",
      "Atmosphere - Polished and serene, with a european feel minus any \"attitude.\" My small, immaculate room on the second floor was completely silent - absolutely no view, but I really didn't care becase the decor was lovely and fun. Nice size bathroom too. Somehow, I lucked out and had a window air conditioner, but I am not sure if all rooms have this.\n",
      "Service - Front desk staff are attentive and hardworking. Cafe Andree has great food at surprisingly low prices. Even room service was inexpensive. The business center is convenient (no charge), and my room was promptly cleaned every day.\n",
      "Price - At $175 per night booked on the Rex website, I received a voucher for a full breakfast each morning and tickets to the Asian Art Museum. Well worth it, no regrets.\n",
      "Lastly, if I am not mistaken, the chain that owns the Rex maintains headquarters directly across the street from the hotel. If this serves as an incentive to keep the hotel running smoothly, it sure is working!\n",

Love the changing exterior lights at night. Lobby is very cool, check out the fireplace! Check-in was easy. Room cost reasonable. There is a charge for parking, of course, normal for any downtown hotel anywhere, but very convenient and reasonable. Rooms were roomy and beautifully done. Requests for rollaway and microwave were accommodated quickly. Wonderful pool area, great view while swimming. Didn't actually try the spa but I assume the rating below includes the pool area, from what we could see of the actual spa I have no doubt that it would be as good as the rest of the experience. Breakfast buffet was amazing, rivals the best anywhere. Not a single negative. We had three rooms with different family members and all felt the same. Our daughter and her husband had room service for breakfast and again, quick, delicious, and fun. Be aware that they mention airport shuttle, but actually what they have is an agreement with third party providers, not a bad arrangement but we did have one cab driver who tried to take advantage. Got out, called the Omni, and another was sent immediately. Needed a taxi at one point, loved the bellman's traditional taxi whistle, very effective. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone willing to pay just a little more for an awful lot of really cool details.\n",

General Manager Karl Friedrich and his excellent staff make each guest feel welcome, and the hotel overall has achieved the highest standards in our judgment, and we have been a few places. Paulette's Restaurant is the Inn's four-star restaurant that consistently earns its \"Most Romantic\" and \"Best Continental\" designation, clearly a Memphis favorite made even more memorable by our waitress, Donna, who knows the menus by heart and guided us to some delicious grouper and salmon dishes with lobster bisque, homemade raspberry sorbet (\"they make it every three hours!\") and a french crepe featuring locally grown plums (\" grown on a nearly farm on Highway 51\").

The hotel is a well refurbished 1920's building given a modern, funky interior decor with some of the wonderful original features retained such as the second floor lift lobby. The staff are very helpful and informative which is just as well as the room was devoid of any guide to the hotel and its services. There is a charge for the Wi-Fi but, if you log-on and join the Kimpton In Touch program, which is free, the Wi-Fi is free too. I guess it's a good way for the hotel to build its marketing data base.\n",
      "While the public area decor is funky (eg; art works such as a sculpture of little men abseiling down the wall of the lobby) our room was slightly minimalist with a bed, table/desk and desk chair but no other chair and no tea/coffee making facilities. It did however have a minibar and you are given the key to this - this explained why the inside of the cabinet was quite dusty - the room maid does not have a key to the minibar cabinet.\n",
      "The evening wine-tastings, which are free, were quite popular with all the guests and a nice touch which we greatly appreciated. The reception staff were very helpful in arranging a limousine hire for us as well as a river cruise and Talisa in particular was extremely helpful in assisting us to sort out some difficulties we were experiencing with our Westpac Bank by scanning and email our passports to the bank for us.\n",

We were in Boston for something else and having a great time window shopping in all the designer stores and while having a drink in the hotel bar (a great place with a huge drinks menu and great food) when we decided we didn't want to go home. I asked about the rate and was told $329. When I asked if they could do any better, I was immediately given a rate of $249. Our room was on the 25th floor and was a corner room. We had amazing city views and two entire walls were windows. My only issue with this hotel was with the tv of all things. The cabinet holding it was in front of one of the windows and because of this I guess, it was not very tall. This made the tv at a weird low angle. Even though it was a flat screen, the picture was not very good. And surprisingly, there is no free tv. Everything is pay per view, and then not many choices. I thought this was odd since I can't remember staying hotel that didn't offer free tv channels. The bathroom was small, but it was very clean and since it was only one night it was fine. Our bed was a king size and was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The pillows were great and normally I can't sleep on hotel pillows. \n",

Special mention for reception and concierge who had always a listing ear and ready to make your stay as confortable as you wish. So, for me it was good \"to be back\". If you want a hotel without negative surprises with a stable level of (very) good quality of service, do not hesitate. Try out also the food from the Shanghai Terrace or The Lobby (yes I skipped Avenues because I did not want to have dinner alone, but I tried it out previously and it was good). The Peninsula is may be not the cheapest around :), but price/quality it suits me perfect.\n",

But without doubt the staff shine, their close knit teamwork results in the highest levels of service to their guests.\n",

The suites are divided into two areas (sleeping & lounge) separated by the bathroom. They have two flat screen TVs, settee, armchair, coffee table, work desk, free internet (wifi & wire), table lamp, ergonomic chair (very few hotels have these and it really helps when you're working). There is also a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board. The beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet. The bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror, good water pressure, and plenty of towels. \n",
      "You can request a room exercise kit if you don't want to go to the gym, and an exercise video. A great idea (I keep promising myself that I'll get around to asking for one... one day!). The swimming pool is out the front of the hotel, it is a good size and has a jacuzzi. It overlooks the carpark, but you're not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is. It is clean, well maintained and there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas.\n",
      "The hotel is set back from the freeway but very little noise can be heard. Mostly guests are individual business travellers and many are regulars or here on longer stays so it's relatively quiet .\n",
      "Breakfast is a buffet with a really good choice and excellent value for money. 3 or 4 types of milk (including Soya) to put on your choice of a dozen different cereals, half a dozen different fruits (always a large bowl of strawberries), a good selection of yoghurts, oatmeal, pastries, bagels (6 varieties), croissants, plus a cooked breakfast buffet with bacon, eggs, hash browns, omlettes, waffles etc. Free newspapers at breakfast. \n",

      "Hotel bus - a real plus. The hotel run a free shuttle bus service to anywhere within a 5 mile radius. They take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when you're ready to be collected. It's like having a personal chauffeur. They will drop / collect you at restaurants, shops (Memorial Mall), wherever within the radius. \n",
      "Staff - you can stay in the best hotel in the world but if the staff are haphazard or surly then your stay is marred or even ruined. I've travelled all over the world and in an average year, spend 150-180 nights in hotels. I can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams I've ever encountered. I won't name them all because I'm bound to miss someone, but when you have Nancy or La-La starting to worry about whether you've returned to the hotel at your regular time, or when the breakfast team give you a hug, then you know that the team really do care. They all take a great pride in their work, in looking after their guests, and they really do work as a team. Hilton - take note, your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team.\n",
      "Downsides - of course there are some:\n",
      "- Air conditioning units can be a bit noisy and draughty. They are next to the bed, but if they were at the other end of the room it would be better.\n",
      "- Makeup mirror - would be good to have a magnifying mirror, but it's not a big deal.\n",
      "- Room safe - plenty of space to put one, so would be good to have.\n",
      "- In-room coffee facilities are good for coffee - but not good for tea. Tea needs boiling water and it shouldn't be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste (you can tell I'm from the UK). An in-room kettle would be great.

My husband had some business he was conducting during Friday & Saturday very near to the hotel; hence, the reason we stayed at this location and not closer to the main attractions of D.C. Additionally, the bedbug registry was checked there were NO reports associated with this hotel so we chose to stay at the Beacon. \n",
      "Having bedbug phobia and upon arrival, my husband & I took apart the beds to check for bedbugs. We saw no signs anywhere around the mattresses or headboards (relief!). The mattresses all seemed new and had those bedbug covers on them. I checked the drawers and all around the place and it looked ok so we stayed. One night my 5 yr son slept only in PJ pants and no shirt and had no bites in the morning upon close inspection. Granted, I nor my family have never had a bedbug encounter, but I've just been reading so much about it I feel like I could accurately identify bites. So it freaks me out .....badly! \n",
      "So anyways, we had reserved adjoining rooms, one room had two double beds, a sleeper couch and a kitchenette and the other was just their standard room with a King sized bed. The exact term would be Corporate Quarters Double Double room which had the kitchenette and our room was a King Deluxe room. The Double was definitely large and was where our boys 5 yrs, 3 yrs and 9 months slept. My neighbor's sister babysat our children at night as we had plans with friends for dinner during the evenings so it was necessary to make sure there was ample room for 3 energetic boys. The kitchenette, sink, microwave, etc sure came in handy. We had bought snacks such as microwavable popcorn and frozen pizzas for them while they watched a TV show with the sitter. The bathroom was very large and there was lots of closet space. Overall the room was clean. I had requested a crib for our baby and a pac-n-play was brought to us quickly up room arrival. I would suggest requesting a high chair from the restaurant as there are none in the room. One was brought for us to use during our stay. \n",
      "The king room that adjoined the double room was very small, which was fine for us to sleep in, keep our clothes in and have some privacy. We were very grateful that we purchased the double and not another King for our boys. It was probably not the biggest room I've stayed in but it was ok for us. If you are looking for luxury and plan to spend much time in your room, I'd suggest upgrading to a larger room. \n",
      "Overall, we were very pleased with the service and our stay. It was quiet and we barely heard other patrons or street noise so that was lovely! We did not eat in the hotel so I can not rate the food however, we had heard through friends that the brunch is very good. \n",
      "Lastly, upon writing this a week after our stay, we are 100% sure that we had NO bedbug encounters and have not brought any home, although we did take all the necessary precautions to not bring them into our home. I would recommend staying here.\n",

      "Text: Our family recently returned from an overnight trip to Universal Studios for Halloween Horror Nights and we loved our stay at the Hilton. The walk to/from Universal was really easy (even at 2 am), the hotel was safe and clean and every single employee we came across was really nice and friendly and truly seemed to care that we were all happy and well taken care of. In total, we had three rooms but we all came in one vehicle and we were only charged for one vehicle. No issues with billing, check in and check out was a breeze (much appreciated since my husband and I were traveling with all teenagers). It was a flawlessly easy break with the kids thanks to the Hilton. Also, about an hour after we arrived, they brought us all (in all three rooms) bottled waters compliments of the hotel...very nice touch. The view from the hotel was amazing! The beds and pillows..so comfy! Great trip, you can't go wrong staying here.\n",

Returning to the hotel one early evening I started to feel very sick because of food poisoning from a meal eaten elsewhere. The next morning, after a terrible night of pain and suffering, I was dehydrated and in desperate need of a chicken broth to recuperate my exhausted body. I called the front desk and was told that there were room services just for breakfast, but considering my situation they would look into what they could do for me. Twenty minutes later, to my surprise, they send to my room a complimentary chicken broth, along with some ginger ale, which made me feel much better and able to go see a doctor after a good rest. This is what I call excellent customer service.\n",

But if it were a bad weather day we could have easily used the metro. We were early so our room wasn't ready, but the gentlemen at the front desk was very kind and told us to hang around in their very nice, large lobby area and make ourselves a hot drink. There was alot to choose from. Several different kinds of fresh coffee, gourmet teas, chai, and Hot chocolate. The kids loved the large fish tank with beautiful exotic fish in it. \n",
      "When we got our room we found it immaculately clean and very well appointed. The beds were so plush and there was a mirco/Fridge.

But at 11 PM they were still being very loud so I opened our door and found them in the hall near the elevator doing their cheerleading. They were even doing cartwheels in the hall. I kindly asked them to stop and they did for a while. Then about 30 min. later they started again. Someone had called security and within minutes a guard was there and it stopped.\n",
      "The next morning at checkout I had mentioned that our stay was wonderful except for the loud girls and I thanked them for sending a guard up to stop it. This was not the fault of the hotel, but the nice front desk guy took $20 off our already good room rate for the trouble.\n",

The Raffaello hotel is in a great location. A little off a side street so all the main traffic isn't in front of the hotel. All you have to do is walk a block and you are in front of the John Hancock Center and a big intersection of Michigan Avenue.

We came back around 3 and our room still wasn't going to be available until 4:30-5:00. However, they did say they had a handicap room available immediately on lower floor. To be honest I was exhausted and so I said we would take it. GREAT IDEA! Our room had plenty of extra space to move around in. My dad fell asleep as soon as he laid down on the bed! I took a nap too. The beds are very comfy with the nice thick but soft pillows. Something I noticed was the fan/air conditioning. It was on my side of the room and I turned it up full blast and it hardly made any noise at all! This was a huge plus for me.There were plenty of outlets for me to charge up all my electronics after the flight and before the meet. I enjoyed playing with the iHome and my iPod touch. :) The bathroom was large! I don't know if it is like that in all the rooms or just because we had a handicap room.

It has those in abundance, but it has something else that truly sets it above and apart from even what most would otherwise consider the best. The Management and Staff of the Iroquois New York genuinely care about the pleasure you take from your stay with them. No, it is not overt or even subtly obsequious treatment that lacks sincerity and substances. It is exclusively about how you, the guest, perceives the physical characteristics of the hotel, the merits of its collective efforts, and the overall attitude and manner the entire package is delivered. They could not do it better. Moreover, no hotel my wife and I have ever stayed in forty-two plus years of traveling in Asia, Europe, Canada, The Caribbean, and the United States has come even close.\n",

      "Text: First off, let me say that this is not a review of a Champaign tour or any of that stuff. This is a review of actually staying overnight (2 nights) at The Mansion on O. A friend of ours was in town and booked a room here. It was a suite so he asked us to stay. \n",
      "Parking here was an extra $30 per night and parking was behind one of the nearby buildings down an alleyway. Still, the car was fine even if parking was pretty pricey. Check in was pretty easy - entry was through a door at street level so you didn't have to climb the outside steps whilst schlepping your luggage. The husband of the husband/wife team who run the place took care of us and was friendly and helpful. He gave us a mini tour which was great. We were greeted in a room that looks like a library. Our room was on the 3rd. floor (I think) and it was a suite with a bedroom, livingroom, bathroom, kitchenette and an outside deck.\n",
      "Okay, here's where it gets hairy. The kitchenette was up some stairs and off of the bedroom area. It appeard to have seen better days and I'm not sure the appliances worked but there were no pots/pans. It wasn't any too clean, either so we avoided that area. Off the kitchen was a door to a deck. It looked pretty precarious - wires hanging nearby, etc. I was afraid of stepping out there for fear of falling through - seriously. The bathroom was laid out so that someone could be taking a shower and the sink area was accessable. It was fine but there was carpet throughout the bathroom (here's a ewww factor). The carpet was not real clean as none of the place was very clean - everything was very dusty. Some lint was on the carpet - it was there when we first got there and it was still there when we left - I was careful not to walk barefooted on the floors. We had the sitting room area with a pull out couch. The couch was very comfortable and done up really nicely. The pillows were comfortable and the mattress must have had a topper on it because it was not at all like any pull out couch I've slept on. I'll give them credit here. On the other hand, there was a faux fireplace in the sittingroom area. It was not quite against the wall because the entire wall was hung with art work - all for sale - even behind the fireplace!! There was no place to put your personal items such as a table, etc. because every inch was covered with \"stuff\". There was a huge walk in closet which stored some of \"stuff\" but plenty of room to hang cloths. There was a desk and after moving around the things all over the desk we used that to put our personal items on. As others have said, it's a little overdone with the kitch. There was stuff literally everywhere and everything (except the guitars) was for sale. It was like staying at an estate sale or at your eccentric great aunts old house with all kinds of crap laying around - except your aunt may have dusted from time to time. There is no central a/c so window units were around which wasn't a problem but then you got to looking at the windows and all the peeling paint outside. Maintenance is not one of the strong points of this property.\n",
      "Our room was situated behind a bookcase in the middle of a stairway. The door was a bookcase and the lock was a long spike that you put into the side of the bookcase which went into the wall to keep the door shut. From the inside there was a kind of lock at the top of the door to keep it closed. The spike, when you were gone, was just laid on the shelf behind a magazine or book to conceal it. At first, we put the spike on that shelf - but we were in the room with the inside latch set when some people who were attending a wedding attempted to get into our room. They found the spike, inserted it in the hole and we were locked in!! We had to call the front desk to have them open the room. There was no way to secure the room when you were gone. The sign on the door that said the room was occupied didn't do much good because we had several people tried to get in. When you were out for dinner, you had no choice but to leave the spike on the shelf so anyone could have access to the room. This did not give me a warm fuzzy as I had my laptop and other valuables in the room. \n",
      "I really wanted to like this place because it's the type of place that would grab one's fancy. The rooms were not cookie-cutter rooms like a regular hotel. They were unique and very interesting. The cabin room with a loft area next to ours was really nice as were many of the other rooms we saw. The kitchen was available on a kind of \"help yourself\" basis to fix your own breakfast I guess. We didn't go there because we went walking in the morning and found a place nearby for breakfast. I guess I'd have loved it had they weeded out the junk, cleaned it better by removing all or most of the \"for sale\" stuff from the rooms. Instead, it looks like they're not sure what they want this place to be - an estate sale where you can sleep or a bed and breakfast with interesting art pieces for sale. They need to go one way or another but at present, this isn't working well. \n",
      "I don't know what my friend paid for this room but from the pricing I saw online it's way over the top for what you get. I've traveled for work and stayed at some beautiful B & B's and top notch hotels that weren't near the published price of this place and were much nicer. Published rates for The Fireplace Suite - if you are not a \"member\" (whatever that means) is $900 per night - about $700 per night overpriced in my opinion - and I'm being generous here.\n",
      "I would rate this much higher if I were simply taking a tour rather than staying here because, for a tour the place is really amazing with all the antiques, artwork and collectibles. The diningroom and main floor where events are held was really nice. The intricate corridors and ways to get from place to place, hidden wine cellar and rooms were neat. All that is great - it's the staying and seeing how difficult it was that drove me to the rating I'm giving. Maybe the answer is to run this as a museum and forget about the B&B part?? There seems to be no focus to this place - is it a retreat for musicians? Is it a B&B? Is it an estate sale? I'm not sure but the Mansion on O St. is definitely unique!\n",

      "Other reviews are correct with turning left and not right when exiting the main entrance, as the right hand side is a more shady area, with the left bringing you out to Bloomingdales etc. However, some reviewers have over exaggerated with the \"danger\" side of turning left - these are homeless people not necessarily criminals.\n",

My only complaint, were I forced to find one, is that the bed was a little soft and the pillows rather flat, so I didn't sleep quite as well as I do in my own bed. I had toyed with the idea of changing my reservation to the Westin when it offered a big sale right before I left, but I'm so glad I did not.

The beds were comfy and the large window seats were fabulous for city-gazing. The best (and worst) thing that was unique to this hotel was the goldfish companion the staff brought to our room upon arrival. I was actually very excited to receive my pet. My sister and I named him Chewy and said goodnight to him before going to sleep. Sadly, the next morning Chewy was floating lifelessly at the top of the fish bowl. Not a pleasant way to start out the day! These things happen I suppose, but I hope the hotel does have some system of trying to prevent it from happening, such as keeping track of how old the fish are and which ones are likely to die soon. Our goldfish was replaced by the time we retuned to the hotel for the night. Chewy II survived for the rest of our stay, thankfully. \n",

      "From the first moment that we arrived at the hotel, we were absolutely thrilled with both the premises and the service.\n",
      "The first encounter with Lenox staff is the doormen, who are polite, helpful and friendly. They really do help create a fabulous first impression of this hotel! And the strong Boston accent is a real welcome when you are new to the city!\n",
      "The hotel Lobby is immaculate and greets you with a really warm and inviting atmosphere – especially during the cold month of February. The roaring fire, tasteful décor and mood lighting all help to set the tone for the hotel – welcoming, with a sense of luxury and charm. \n",
      "Before check in, you are greeted by the concierge staff and asked if you would like your bags taken to your room. Obviously, being in America, a tip is expected, but as you are politely asked if you would like this service, you feel under no pressure. We did take up this service and felt that it was well worth the tip.\n",
      "Upon check in, we were informed that we would be staying in a Junior Suite and within minutes, were presented with our key cards – check in at The Lenox is quick and easy! The front desk staff are more than polite; they did all they could to not only welcome us when we arrived, but also made us feel welcome throughout our whole stay, each morning asking how we were and if they could do anything to help, and each evening asking how our day had been. \n",
      "The corridors and communal areas do not let the hotel down; décor is fresh and tasteful, corridors clean and quiet and there are also services such as lifts, ice and water machines etc. We did not use the fitness centre, so cannot comment on this, but from what we saw of it, it look as though it was well equipped with all you would need for a work out.\n",
      "Our room was absolutely beautiful. The furniture and décor fits in with the old feel of the hotel, yet it offers luxury and comfort. Having emailed the hotel prior to our trip to inform them that it was one of our party member’s 30th Birthday, requesting a good view of the city from our room, I was overwhelmed to find that not only had the staff met the request of giving us a room with a lovely view of the city, but they had also left us a welcome note and basket, filled with American goodies – Hershey’s chocolate, bags of pretzels, Boston souvenirs etc. We really were touched by this and it just shows how the staff at The Lenox do go that extra mile!\n",
      "I slept superbly each of the 5 nights of my stay – in the room are two double beds – they are comfortable and you are offered plenty of spare pillows and blankets for the cold winter nights (although these were not needed as there was a very effective heating/air con system which allowed you to fully control the temperature of the room). \n",
      "In the spacious room, we also had a large walk in wardrobe with plenty of hanging space. This wardrobe also housed a very user friendly safe. There was plenty more storage space in the form of a chest of draws; There was also a very large, flatscreen TV which offered loads of entertainment channels. The fridge had complimentary bottled water, which was restocked everyday and the ice machine was conveniently right outside our room.\n",
      "The room offered many other comforts, such as an I-pod docking station, desk and business chair, sofa and coffee table and a beautiful fireplace (not working – just for effect). Oh, and the nightly turn-down service with chocolates on your pillow is a lovely extra touch!\n",
      "The bathroom was cleaned thoroughly everyday and every detail was thought of – hairdryer, phone in the bathroom, plenty of clean towels (if needed, although The Lenox are an environmentally friendly hotel and do encourage re-use), extractor fan, dressing gowns, complimentary toiletries and even ornate gold-effect taps! It really was lovely!\n",
      "When we holiday in America, we do like to get out and try the local food, so we did not eat breakfast in the hotel. Although, each morning, there are complimentary tea and coffee facilities set up in the lobby. Nor did we eat dinner at The City Table – but we have read excellent reviews about this restaurant. We did visit the Hotel’s Irish Bar on a couple of occasions – The Solas – and this was a lovely atmosphere, with TV screens for sports fans. We ate here on one evening and I can thoroughly recommend this place to eat – especially considering that food is served til late – 1am if I remember correctly - great after a long day of sightseeing. On this note, it is also worth mentioning that although we did not use room service, the menu was very reasonably priced. \n",
      "I have stayed in 5 star hotels in the Caribbean, been on 4/5* cruise liners, and I can honestly say that this is possibly the nicest hotel I have stayed in. The staff work so hard to make your stay special and it felt so great to return ‘home’ to The Lenox after a day of walking through the city.\n",
      "Practical info on the hotel – nearest T Station is Copley (green line) and this is about a 2 minute walk. You are located right by The Prudential Centre (Tower and Shopping Mall) and Copley Square, with Trinity Church and The John Hancock Tower just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. A Taxi from Logan cost us around $30, including tip. You must also try Whiskey’s Bar, just down the street!\n",

      "Text: Just returned from a long weekend in San Antonio where we stayed at the Drury Plaza based on previous Tripadvisor reviews. These people weren't kidding!! The Drury Plaza is an absolute gem!! We stayed in the new tower building in a huge riverview suite. The room had a huge balcony that overlooked the riverwalk and downtown. It was very spacious with 2 chairs. The hotel is located at the beginning of the riverwalk, but it's location is excellent, because it is quiet at night, but it has quick and easy access to all that the riverwalk has to offer.\n",
      "Everything about this hotel is excellent. From the moment we checked in, the service was great, the people were so friendly and ready to help. Everyone that you walk by says \"hello\" and asks how your stay is going. The cleaning staff are very friendly and accomodating, and always smiling. The true bonus here is the incredible amount of food that the hotel offers at no extra charge. They have a huge buffet breakfast with hot items like eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy (yum!). They also have a \"5:30 Kickback\" cocktail hour which is amazing!!! Each person gets three free (alcoholic!) drinks and tons of yummy \"bar food\" snacks like nachos and chicken fingers. If you stay on the weekends though, get there early!!! The lines for food/drinks were very loooong, but worth it! You could absolutely stay at this hotel and never have to buy any food--although that would be a shame because San Antonio has some of the best! \n",
      "The hotel also has a very cool rooftop pool and a few terraces were you can hang out and overlook the city. The pool was clean and refreshing with a great backdrop. Plus, it is open until 10pm! They also have a nice indoor pool as well if the weather is not cooperating that day. \n",
      "The room was super nice!! VERY large, with a sitting are and a nice, big bedroom. There were two large flat screen TV's -- a big plus! They also have nice, large, clean bathrooms. THe room feels so clean I had no issues walking on the carpets with my bare feet! They also have free wi-fi, which is yet another great plus. It also has managed to keep some of the \"historic\" feel to it while still being quite modern. \n",
      "I know some people wrote about this hotel and said that there are \"bums\" around the hotel. Well, yes, there are bums, because this is a city!! Some bums do hang out under the overpass that you walk through to get to/from the hotel to riverwalk, however, this has nothing to do with the hotel, and it not something that they can fix. The bums are nowhere near the hotel!! Plus, the hotel is only accessable with your hotel card, so there is no chance that random people can just wander in. It's a city, the bums are there-- ignore them and they ignore you. Plus, you can walk on the \"street side\" to get to the hotel as well, if that makes you more comfortable. \n",
      "Seriously, this hotel is the BEST!!!! We LOVED, loved, loved every aspect of the hotel and our stay in San Antonio. The staff is great, the beds are comfy, and the food is plentiful!! There should be no other choice when staying in SA. The Drury is a great, great hotel and I wish they had more locations!! I would return in a heartbeat.\n",

Don't let that stop you from staying at this wonderful hotel! The property is brand new and the rooms are very clean and comfortable (and believe me - i'm impossible to please!). The neighborhood is up and coming - some beautiful new buildings are being built and i suspect that in the next few years our family would be priced out of it this hotel and area. Metro access is too good to be true, and the Harris Teeter market (i know, it's a funny name) is on par with Bristol Farms for those of you on the west coast.

I ended up fighting with them for 2 months after my last stay, just to get them to do what they said they would do! I had to follow up with them several times, in order to get them to keep their promises. That is really sad, when you can't even expect them to keep their word. I wont go into any more details of that stay, because it's already in here somewhere. This time, however, we are again.....not happy at all! The ONLY thing this place has to offer is the location. You will find that they are experts at finding ways to get tip money from you by hijacking your luggage, etc. You will find that the drinks they make you in the bar will be TERRIBLE, and cost $15.00 each. They don't even have a blender and cannot make frozen type drinks. Why not? Can't Hilton afford a blender? You will find that the wireless internet service will not stay connected. The signal will go in and out and have to keep trying to re-connect. We had 2 different laptops with us and they both had the same problem. We ended up going accross the street to the Star Bucks to use the internet from there. We also ended up using the Applebees (located inside the Hilton) for drinks. There is NO pool or and NO spa! The gym is very small and poorly equipped. We also expected poliote/respectful/professional staff. And, sadly, this proved to not be true as well. They were less than helpful with us on several occassions and were downright rude as well. We understood that this would be expensive. After all, it's Times Square! But, we also expected things to work! And that the food and drinks would be good (for those prices), and we are sad to report that we cannot give the Hilton a good report. AND that this is the second time in a row! Once in Phoenix and once here in Times Square-New York city. We have been traveling now for over 2 weeks. We went to England, France, Germany, etc. And all of our accomadations at the other places where we stayed, were great!. None of them were Hilton! So we have stayed in different Hotels every night for the last couple of weeks, and everyone did a better job than Hilton.

The cottage is was large enough to sleep 4 people very comfortably and it is just steps from the beach. The cottages are decorated very nicely and the staff are very accomodating. We slept with the windows wide open so that we could hear the ocean waves, very relaxing. There are plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance and there are plenty of little shops for those who are like me and need a souvenir from every place that I stay. Another perk is that the Crystal Pier is right down the boardwalk. The cottages have kitchenettes with a small set of dinnerware and silverware, so you can bring food and prepare it there, there are also barbeques as well. It is a family friendly place with ping pong tables for the kids. If you want to be close to the beach with all the comforts of home, the Beach Cottages is the place to be.\n",

I feel the place is very well situated not far from all major resort and theme parks. Putting green was expensive 18$ for two adults but apart from that everthing else was resonable. Somepeople seem to be moaning about ants i saw 50 or so of them for about 30 seconds of so, out of 10 days that is very good. Had our own lemon tree out back and a duck which laid us an egg. What a great place cannot wait to return as the people of San Diego are so friendly. I didnt have any kids with me but there is lots for them to do there. The reception staff must be among the friendliest I have ever met. Puts our hotels to shame.\n",

Not quite sure why there are all these great reviews. For a little more $$, one can stay in a much nicer hotel in a safer area. I stayed for one night for a quick visit to Columbia with my teenage sons and would not return. We had two rooms, one was billed as a suite. Really tiny. The hotel is very old, the decor is really old, the rooms are small and dark. The air conditioner (which is attached to the window and old) made so much noise it was difficult to sleep. The view out of the windows is into a dark alley and an ugly buidling next door. I will say that the rooms are clean and the staff was nice. The bathrooms have been updated. However, I felt uncomfortable and unsafe during my stay. It has a very \"seedy\" feel to it. I saw one of the staff very thoroughly check out my as yet undeveloped 13 year old daughter.

The hotel was very nice, and the location was very central just off of busy M Street NW on 30th. Despite its proximity to the shopping district, the hotel was very quiet. Georgetown U was a short cab ride away, and we walked to George Washington U. The suite was complete with a full kitchen--big refrigerator, microwave, sink, stovetop, cabinets. I can't remember if there was an oven. The bed and pillow were very comfortable--I did not even have to use the pillow I travel with! There were many closets and a dresser and desk. The hotel features Bath and BodyWorks shampoo, etc--always a plus for me! Breakfast included cereal, fruit, yogurt, cereal bars, PopTarts, toast, good bagels, pastries, muffins, coffee, tea, etc. I was very happy with the rate although I will warn that there is a parking fee of $18 per day. You do have unlimited in/out privileges. Also note that the ceilings were low--I am not sure an SUV could fit in there. Check with the hotel. We stayed at the 30th Street location, having read on TripAdvisor that it was preferred. It has a nice courtyard off of 30th Street that was pretty with landscaping. Recommendation for dinner is Bangkok Joe's, Asian cuisine, very tasty and upscale but not too pricey. Great location at 3000 K Street NW (walking distance from the hotel) and in the fun Washington Harbor area (shops, dining, people watching, harbor walk). M Street has lots of shops and restaurants too. All in all, a great hotel in a great location.\n",

At least a response stating that they didn't have such a room would have been an indication that they cared about you.\n",

We knew right away this hotel was not friendly so we canceled our second night and stayed at the 10 times better Hilton! Went down to the bar in the lobby the next morning to grab some quick breakfast and had to remind them 3 times about the hot chocolate I ordered and paid for. I even had to stir the powdered drink myself because they were too interested in the next patron. Couldn't sit down to eat because EVERY table had garbage on it from the last person that sat there. NOBODY cared at all about the cleanliness of the hotel or the service which was almost non existent. Maybe it's because I was an American. All staff were foreigners, and so were most of the guests. Too bad if you don't like that comment, but that's the way it was. Not the first experience with that. Don't support any place that treats you like this place did. They will never change otherwise. Went to the Hilton Times Square and let me tell you, it was magnificent. We all had a good experience there. They couldn't help you enough!! Get with it Roosevelt!

Room was clean and free of any bad smells. The whole property is non-smoking. Unique pictures on walls of Life Magazine front pictures from as early as 1913 in my room. There isn't much in the way of eating establishments close to the hotel. However just over one or two streets are is a wide variety. This hotel is convenient if you want to go to Macy's and the Empire State Building. It also very close to the Herald Square MTA subway stop. However, for the parade route, head way north. There is no real good access to see the parade at the Macy's store. You'll get a better view of the parade from around Central Park West. It's crowded but less crowded than at Macy's or in other parts of the downtown Manhattan area. My only minor complaint about my room was that the bathtub drained slowly.

It was clean and the staff were friendly and reasonably helpful. The room was large. We had a studio suite which had a full kitchen and sitting room. We didn't really use the kitchen as we were out so much but it was nice to have the refrigerator,etc. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom was ok and with no shortage of towels. The a/c - heating system was noisy and we had to turn the fan off in order to sleep. It was a definite plus having the complimentary breakfast each morning. It was quite good and with more variety than I expected. The staff in the a.m. were fantastic. The complimentary dinner/social was ok (served Mon,Tues,Wed). Again more food and variety than I expected...not gourmet for sure but ok and great for families. The hotel was close to the metro which was great but had no restaurants or pubs nearby which was a definite negative. It would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel. Able to walk to most attractions. Hot tub was nice...didn't use the pool. We had an issue with the fee at the hotel. I booked on-line at the Washington.org website. I thought that I was booking directly thru the Marroitt, however apparently it was thru a third party. I was given a price when I booked and then another price from the hotel. The price from the hotel was lower. I called the hotel twice (from Canada) and was told both times that the lower price was what I would pay. Not the case. I called 'the 3rd party' and was told by them that they would call the hotel to talk with the manager to straightened the price out. When we arrived at the hotel I tried to explain the situation to the manager but felt that he totally dismissed us with very little conversation at all. He barely listened to us and walked away while I was talking to him. Not a very nice welcome to the hotel. When I mentioned Marriott rewards he waved his hand and mumbled something about \"no Marriott rewards with this type of booking.\". Not sure what that was all about. Despite the unpleasant experience that we had with the manager we enjoyed the hotel, however I'm not sure that I would stay there again because of that!\n",

We have been traveling to Boston Children's for our son's complex heart condition for nearly 10 years now, but until recently we have not been fortunate enough to obtain reservations here during our stay. This hotel seemed to be very popular and availability limited. Once we experienced the Inn at Longwood, we began scheduling planned hospitalizations for our son around the hotel's room availability! We had found out first hand why it was so popular and didn't want to have to return to staying elsewhere. During our last two emergency hospital stays, the inn had no vacancies, but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room. The first time their desk clerk, Amy, (with the help of the manager, Bill Davies) managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim. Then just last week we were again faced with the \"no room at the inn\" situation and about to give up. The manager, Bill Davies, went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament. We were just about to give up late at night (after checking back frequently during the day for availability) when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us. It is so refreshing to find that there are still caring people out there who will help you when the chips are down. We will be returning to Boston and The Inn at Longwood again tomorrow for more medical treatment, and are thankful to have this refuge during times of struggle.\n",

The king bed was very comfortable and there was no road noise. A lot of the room showed wear & tear, old carpet, scuffed furniture etc which I didn't expect in this price bracket.\n",
      "I found front desk check in unhelpful and surly. Also shocked that despite having a fully paid voucher for the stay they booked the same amount again (over $800USD) to my visa debit card to cover incidentals (beware if you use a debit visa, my bank assures me this shouldn't be necessary) which seemed excessive.\n",
      "Failed to see any evidence of a Japanese theme in the rooms other than the Anzu (?) restaurant.\n",
      "The tv in the room wouldn't work, I informed front desk to get it fixed several times as I was leaving for tours / meals out but they kept telling me to see them when I was back and they'd arrange it then - not good enough.. by the time I got in late from excursions I just wanted a drink and the tv working before sleeping and not waiting around for someone to come up. \n",
      "Overall given the price I was disappointed and would try somewhere else next time. I would like to point out that the staff at the front door were excellent and always willing to help.... perhaps put them on reception !!\n",

This is a hotel from a bygone era. Don't let the modern facade of the building fool you. As soon as you enter the hotel and make your way to the reception desk and see the vaulted ceilings and furnishings, you can feel yourself going back in time. The front desk staff is most attentive and often have people from all over the world working there. They are quick to help and guide you on any question or concern. The location is right in downtown San Diego. You can walk to most anything. Shopping, eating and site seeing can all start from this location. Restaurants abound at all prices, cuisine and ambiance. Shopping is nearby and again in different price ranges. When you step off the elevator and circle around to your room, you know you are in a very nice hotel. Each two rooms share a single \"keyed\" entrance to an anteroom. Then you enter your own room. Spacious is the word. The decor is beautiful. Everything in its right place. The bathroom is as big as you will see. Comfortable bed and heating/air-conditioning. I haven't used the hotel eating facility, because of the large number of choices nearby. I would recommend Maria's Mexican Restaurant at 1011 4th Avenue. It's a hole in the wall, but the people are very nice and the food is quite good. The workout room is well maintained with good equipment. The USS Midway is a \"must see.\" There is a showroom with restored cars (for sell) in the wonderful gaslight District that is well worth visiting. I would not hesitate to stay here for business or pleasure.\n",

Luxurious cream marble baths, carpeted bedrooms, amazingly comfortable king beds. Solicitous and mannered staff, from greeters/valet at pullup in the rental car and thorough kind mannered and well trained front desk staff. Prompt service from room service, valet car pickup requests, and on premises restaurant, Ame. \" Is there anything else I can do for sir ?\" was a common question with each encounter with this hotel's staff. Stay here if you like contemporary furnishings, spectacular city views. Lobby bar and lounge is popular with locals and can get busy and noisy later in the evening. Well designed lobby and public areas, perhaps this property is not for you if you prefer traditional furnishings, though. I enjoy the complimentary coffee available in the mornings on the fourth floor by the casual restaurant and the large L shaped gym on 5. I did not use the 6th floor pool or spa, however. Prompt and thorough housekeeping staff and eager to please turn down service in the evenings, with every request met promptly and willingly. Museum of Modern Art is next door, and Metreon Center is across the street for films, Union Square and Market St. shopping just a few blocks away. My only negative observation is that the room/suite furnishings are looking slightly worn, some stains on the mohair sofa, and wood furniture looking very slightly scratched. Lovely thick towels, bathrobes, generous toiletries. Closet and drawer space is very limited however, a common design flaw among higher end contemporary hotels, I find. High speed elevators with rarely more than a few seconds wait. I love the motorized curtains and sun shades in the suite's bedrooms, although I must say the centralized touch screen telephone/command center can be frustrating and confusing to use unless you concentrate and look closely at the screen and it's functions.\n",

I chose the Gansevoort for its location in the Meatpacking district and reputation as a fun area to stay. The district is entirely commercial during the day, and only at night does the area come alive. Most of the people coming into the area are coming for the local clubs. But if you plan on seeing the rest of the city, the location puts you a further cab ride away. I reserved the grand deluxe room. The room was small, but clean and had a modern design. The bathrooms were nice for NY standards. The view was of the meat packing district and the river. However, the heater in the room would not turn off (call one to the front desk). Then the mini bar key was locked with no key (call two). Then the remote control did not work (call three). Not exactly what I expected for nearly $700 a night. The lobby is small and the rooftop bar is equally small, especially when tented during the winter. The NY party was packed with very little seating and completely indoors (also ran $175 per person just for drinks and a few appetizers). For my last day I decided to try the W Tuscany on Park Avenue. It had a small lobby...but the rooms were just as nice as the Gansevoort and MUCH bigger for $319 a night. Although a more business location...the hotel was much closer to most of NYC's attractions. I also visited the Hudson to see what I missed out on. The Hudson still has the Gansevoort beat on style. The Library Bar and main Bar are beautiful, as is the garden bar.

And even when it was pouring down rain, the front desk gave us nice umbrellas!! Location is everything and surprisingly the Marriott was the best location to suit our needs. We left the hotel early every morning and returned after 10 PM every evening. I felt very safe and secure. We shopped and dined all day and when it was time to retire, it was nice to return to a quiet uncrowded area to unwind. We ate the breakfast buffet in the morning, a bit pricey at $20 per person (children were half price). The spread was fantastic, though. Everything you would ever want, from fresh fruit to made to order omelets. The fitness center and pool were very nice also. The entire hotel was spotless. We stayed in the corner room with 2 queen beds and plenty of space to spread out.There was a nice bureau and a desk with a chair and a lounging chair. The beds were out of this world comfy!!! The bathroom was full sized and very euro chic. And most importantly, CLEAN!! All in all, I have not one bad thing to write about the Marriott Financial District!\n",

      "Title: “Very Nice Historic Hotel”\n",
      "Text: The Best Western at Pioneer Square was a real treat for us staying before and after an Alaskan cruise. I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. \n",
      "For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again. It was a real treat and a step back in time, since it is an historical hotel.\n",

      "I had orginally asked for a junior suite with a great view however when we arrived, it was raining, I was cold and wet and had bronchitus and my other half had the flu so we asked if there was anything available right away so we could get out of our wet clothes and have a hot shower. We were given a junior suite right away - no great view but in the end that didn't matter.\n",
      "Location\n",
      "We stayed 10 nights at the Affinia Dumont in late May / early June as we wanted to be in a neighbourhood which had more of a flavour to where “real” New Yorkers live. The hotel is located on East 34th Street between Lexington and 3rd Ave. The subway (green line) is only a block or so away and the good thing about this location is that the station at Union Square is great for changing to other lines. Cross town buses were easily picked up – from west to east, alight just beyond Park Ave or at 3rd Ave. You can also catch a bus to the East River Ferry in 34th Street too so it is quite a handy location.\n",
      "Adjacent to the Affinia Dumont is a restaurant “the Barking Dog”, and a Baskins Robbins ice creamery. There’s also a Thai restaurant and a Deli on the corner too. Opposite the Affinia Dumont is a Duane Reade pharmacy and market which is handy if you need to top up medications or other items or see a doctor (weekdays only).\n",
      "We bought fruit at the street vendor cnr 34th / 3rd Ave as his fruit was nicer and cheaper than in the Deli / Duane Reade. Nice bread (as opposed to plastic wrapped varieties) can be bought at any of the Zabars bakeries in grand Central.\n",
      "Along 3rd and Lexington Aves there are many other restaurants and cafes and shops and on some weekends, Lexington Ave has a street fair which runs from 34th to about 23rd Street.\n",
      "Around 8 or so blocks north of 34th Street is Grand Central station which is easily walkable from the hotel. \n",
      "There’s a bank with a couple of ATMs on the corner of 34th and Lexington too … really the location has everything at your fingertips.\n",
      "The room\n",
      "Our room was a junior suite and had plenty of room and amenities for us. It was decorated in dark browns (carpet and woods) with light grey, beiges and light olive green and cream accents. We had a double bed and a huge flat screen TV, a large desk and a sofa and tub chair. Our kitchenette had a full size fridge and stove and washing up facilities too. Our room was nicely maintained by housekeeping and always spic and span when we came back from being out and about.\n",
      "If there was one small critiscm, there were no cooking utensils such as eg flips and large spoons suitable for stirring a pot etc and only one large bowl which we used to put fruit in. However it wasn’t a great concern as we ate out most of the time or brought back cooked food from nearby restaurants / delis after all, we were on holidays.\n",
      "Laundry facilities\n",
      "There is a guest laundry in the basement with about 4 machines and dryers as well as a soap dispenser. The washing machines take 8 Quarters as do the dryers and the soap powder costs $1.\n",
      "Internet access\n",
      "Internet access is available throughout hotel and during our stay, the cost was $13.95 per day. I didn't see any nearby cafes apart from one on 28th/Lexington Ave that actually had a notice that free WiFi was available and I certainly didn't feel like lugging my Notepad around NYC to go to a Burger King just to get free WiFi. The way I figured it was that I could pay $13.95 for internet access every now and then or go to a cafe and order a couple of coffees which with tip would probably be similar to the cost of access through the hotel.\n",

I felt like I had walked into a smoker’s lounge that had been in constant use for decades. Everything from the bedding to the towels reeked. I carry a 3 oz bottle of Febreze with me for just such problems. I used it all in no time and the odor was still really bad. We borrowed another bottle from friends and used it twice a day while we were there, opening the windows whenever possible. It made the situation tolerable, but just barely. The hotel was very busy and we were not able to move to a non smoking room: only another smoking room. The hotel had a huge number of smoking rooms compared to a normal hotel I’m basing this on the fact that I walked the property and saw very few rooms with a non smoking sign on the door. If you are a non-smoker this hotel is probably not for you. However, if you are smoker I would suggest staying here. It’s almost like stepping back into another time when people believed cigarettes were no more dangerous than crossing the street.\n",

I was given a room in the old part of the hotel. This was both good and bad. The bathroom that so many people have complained about was actually quite large, larger than the one in my apartment, and had an enormous window overlooking the flower garden. The room itself was very comfortable. The hotel advertises bottled water and a robe in the room and in 5 days I didn't get either. A colleague who had a room in the newer part got both of those things but had the tiny bathroom so I guess I probably had the better deal. I could get bottled water for $1.49 a gallon at the market across the street though the refrigerator didn't really keep it cold. The old part of the hotel is down a long hall from the main lobby and meeting rooms so I had an extra long walk each day. The old part of the building also overlooked the sidewalk where the people protesting the Democratic Rules Committee meeting started shouting and blowing whistles at 8:30 am and also overlooks, as I mentioned, the flower garden where it seems that people like to sit and drink and be loud late at night. I agree with the people who say that for the price they should provide free internet access in the rooms. Rodeway Inn does it in their $40/night rooms. Surely this place could too. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a subway stop right outside the hotel but you have to climb a steep hill to get from the subway to the hotel which is kind of a pain when dragging a heavy suitcase after taking a bus and two trains to get there from BWI. All the public areas and meeting rooms were far too cold. It was only in the low 80s outside. We really didn't need Artic air conditioning. Don't bother eating at the hotel. They are very overpriced and there are lots and lots of restaurants from pizza and sandwiches to Italian, Indian, Lebaneese, Mexican, Baskin Robbins, Afgan, Thai, and Chineese within a block and half. Don't even think about using room service unless you have money to throw away. I looked at the menu and it was possible to spend over $30 on breakfast if you include the \"tax, $4 fee and 22% service charge\" (which if you didn't notice this in the fine print you might give the waiter an additional tip.) On the whole, it was a positive experience and I would probably stay there again for $125/night but not for $350/night.\n",

I did not realize that I would have been on the 17th floor instead of the 8th with free breakfast, but I liked my Luxury suite. \n",

We had to fill our little sink with ice to keep our wine cold.\n",

It was a little pricey, but the food was always top-notch and plentiful. Well when they opened the new buffet, they lowered the prices a little and the quality of the food as well. There did not seem to be as many choices and the food stations are way spread-out. The Asian cuisine was the highlight. Not much else that I found to be appetizing. I think the purposely lowered the prices, so people that want to spend a little more will go to one of the expensiv-o restaurants (Bourbon Steak House and Salt Water) which the entrees were around $35-$50 each. This is just my conjecture, but one FACT is the buffet quality went down from the old casino.\n",

      "Text: This is the first review I have ever written for something. And I have put this off for several months, but with enough consistent bad service, I feel it is time to share my experience with Crowne Plaza in Austin, TX. My husband has stayed at this hotel at least once a month for the past year and on many trips, I join him. Amazingly, this hotel has had some sort of problem each and every time we have stayed there. There has not been one visit that went without problems. Not one!! We are always here on business, therefore we do not get to choose the hotel. My husband's employer, through a local hospital, gets a business deal with this particular hotel and the arrangements are always made for us. Therefore, we do not get a say in where we stay, otherwise obviously we would not continue to return to this hotel. The problems we have faced have included reservation problems such as 1) not having the employer credit card info on file (reservation is always faxed in on a hotel form) and us being required to give a personal card in order to check-in, this has then caused a large freeze on our debit or credit accounts until they can get it worked out and we can have our CC company unfreeze our accounts (24-48 hrs later) 2) our reservation being for the wrong period of time (not enough nights), the wrong type of room (if we requested two beds as we did for the one trip when we brought along our son) 3) being locked out of our room because the reservation ended a day early, with all of our belongings in our room. There have also been times we have had actual room problems such as 1) ant infestation 2) no hot water 3) no air conditioning 4) no wifi....in fact there was one visit in which we moved rooms 3 times before we got into a room that had both hot water and AC, and that ended up being the room that had ants...\n",
      "We keep thinking surely this will get better but it has not. The staff generally wants to \"make things right\" and offer a key card into the executive lounge to get food or a free drink coupon for their bar. This is a nice gesture but honestly, it would be so much better if they just got it right the first time. \n",
      "I will say the staff in the executive lounge are FANTASTIC!!! And the housekeeping staff is also really great. The concierge who sometimes is in the lobby to greet guests is really nice as well. But I am not impressed at all with the front desk and reservations staff. I simply don't understand why it's so difficult to get a hotel reservation correct....at least once in 12-15 visits!!!!! I sure wish we could stay somewhere else and we have tried to get it changed. If you are coming to Austin/North Austin, go to the Embassy Suites...it's just down I-35 a bit and my husband has stayed there and loved it!\n",

I have to guess that both of these are run by members of the same family, because the standards are equally high. Got the goodie bag upon check-in at midnight, checked out the pillow menu and got a great, very quiet and very clean room.

We have high demands and we know what hotels accomodate our needs. This hotel, is one of them. I frequent NY and I have stayed at this hotel 15 times in the last 12 months. To give you an even better understanding of my loyalty I have stayed at Affinia-owned properties at least 25 times in the last 15 months. It has taken some time, but I now walk through the door, and am greeted by my name. (A nice perk) I can honestly say, that there are other hotels in othre locations that I have stayed at more friently that what I have professed at this hotel, and still, I recieve no recognition. That is how this hotel differs.\n",

Their level of hospitality surmounts every other hotel you've stayed in and is notthing you would ever expect. The reason why thier motto is hospitality is because they are the best of the best.

We were barely acknowledged and were told that we wouldn't know \"which\" room we would have until 3:00 p.m. (we booked this 2 days prior with a staff member). When we got the room key and saw that the room was right there in the lobby area, facing the street, we asked for another room. I asked if there were other rooms for us to choose from; the flat answer was \"no, all the rooms are booked\" (but that wasn't true--as we later heard at 1:00 a.m. when a passerby was able to book a room on the spot.The room was located on the 2nd floor--very noisy, noisy, noisy---facing the street, listening to any and all conversations outside the hotel, as well as in the lobby.

Union Square, Market St. and the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market are within walking distance. The hotel deserves high praise for its location, design, style, technology, amenities and especially its service. \n",
      "The St. Regis and Luxury Collection are the Starwood group's high end chains. Having stayed 3 times at the wonderful St. Regis New York and having visited the St. Regis Monarch Beach CA and Washington DC, I was looking forward to my stay here, and at a convention group rate to boot.\n",
      "The hotel is about 2 years old and located on the corner of Mission and 3rd. Directly on the corner, the facade of a historic 8 story building was preserved and a high rise tower was integrated behind, beside and above it, on what once was a parking lot. The hotel occupies the first 20 floors of the tower; the top 20 or so floors are St. Regis residences. Within the older building are the hotel's 2 restaurants--Ame (dinner) on the first floor and Vitrine (breakfast and lunch) on the 4th--as well as the 2 level spa and offices. There is a landscaped terrace on the roof and another larger terrace on the 4th floor which was tented for an outdoor dinner party when I was there. The lobby in the newer building is compact but stylish and well-designed. A design feature of rose petals is echoed throughout the public areas.\n",
      "Our convention rate was for the superior room category on the lower floors (5-8), so I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded to a deluxe room--same size but on a higher floor (15). I also was able to check in early. My room looked similar to the photos posted on 1/1/06 by a TripAdvisor member from Sunnyvale CA. My room faced west with a view of Yerba Buena Gardens, Moscone and points beyond. The east facing rooms face the Bay, but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the Financial District.\n",
      "The room itself was not too large but contemporary and sleek. The entry foyer had a table, wooden floor sculpture and leather walls. There was another wood wall hanging in the bedroom. The bedside table held the St. Regis signature phone/computer that can control the thermostat, lights, window shades, alarm clock, etc. via a touch screen. There were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair, but no chaise lounge or \"fainting chair\" as seen on the hotel web site. There was a large marble window ledge--great for counter space. One wall held the 42\" flat screen TV (which did not swivel) and 3 recessed doors--one was a too small closet (only about 2 feet of space), another held a safe, fax machine (out of ink) and 3 drawers, the third held the minibar and fridge and DVD/CD player. The spacious bath had an enclosed WC, a tub that opened onto the bedroom, a separate shower stall with marble bench, rain head plus hand-held head. There was a 2nd flat screen TV, but only one sink. In the room and bath, there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels.\n",
      "Technological glitches included: 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired (batteries?). With the phone/computer, the party I was speaking to occasionally could not hear me, though I could hear them. The hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when I requested a wake-up call and the operator called twice but could not hear me, so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door. Alas, the phone still was acting up on check out day. \n",
      "Overall service was top notch--quick, courteous and professional--especially the front desk and housekeeping. The problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies. The doormen were not so attentive--often talking with the valets. No one helped me when I walked up with my luggage when first checking in. Some of the concierge staff, while helpful, were a bit aloof. I believe all the St. Regis' offer Butler Service. In New York this is quite formal, but seems less so here. One Butler I spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessional--when she couldn't answer my question, she yelled/asked another employee without putting me on hold, so I could hear every thing.\n",
      "The public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff, and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool, also open 24 hours. The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side. The \"Business Center\" consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators. This may be a temporary location.\n",
      "Regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviews--yes you can hear them, but I imagine the other nearby hotels--W, Four Seasons, Westin, Marriott--can as well.\n",

With the room card in hand, just standing outside our Suite, we discovered housekeeping were just getting the Suite ready for our stay, we can see the bedding from the previous occupant still needed to be change and floor still need hovering. I quickly rushed back to Front Desk as I thought it was unacceptable, in all fairness, prior giving us the key, the Front Office did phone and checked if the suite was ready. As there was no other Suite available, we accepted the one while it was now being prepared by 3 maids. This turned out to be the only mishap throughout our stay.\n",

      "Text: My husband and I just returned from six nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We asked for a quiet location and didn't care about a view, and were given room 701, a junior suite that faces the side of the McDonald's building next door. It was well protected from neighboring room noise (it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet) and fairly protected from street noise, but more about that in a minute. The room was very large and clean, the bed and chairs comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people (though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries). The bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan, as it has no vent or window, and a couple of days when I attempted to shower around noon I had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water (this didn't happen when showering earlier). The kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters, as we did not like the in-room Puck's filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee. The Azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar, including items such as stuffed tofu, sesame noodles, and seafood, a hot foods bar, and many essentials such as boxed cereal, baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks, so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner. A table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk, and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both, but we only had the desk.\n",
      "I had read some reviewers' comments about rooms being too hot, and they were right. In fact, the entire hotel is overheated, and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40-degree air at all times, including at night. Fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units, which created a nice white noise for sleeping. Unfortunately, though, the smell of McDonald's often wafted in. A fan-only setting on the heating/AC unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy, but the only option at this time of year was hot air, because the hotel hadn't yet switched over to AC. We're lucky that we didn't arrive later in spring, because I can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there! Also, there were no screens on the windows, so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open.\n",
      "I do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators: Stay on a lower floor and take the stairs! We were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time, though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing, especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats.\n",
      "The second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed, and has two computers with Internet access for guests. The trouble is, there's no regulation of usage, so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other like-minded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends. Her mother finally told her to get off--but then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email! The other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to Flickr, apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs. The staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area.\n",
      "Overall, we would stay there again, but only during the cold season on the quiet side of the building, or during the hot season when the AC is turned on.\n",

I was impressed by the friendly and accomodating service right from the start. The lobby was beautiful and screamed relaxing! The check in was flawless and up to the room we went. Fast elevator with a british accent welcomed me to my floor. Opened the door to the room and wow was I and my travel mates impressed. Coffee is a must for me so the first I noticed was the upgraded coffee machine with real mugs and real creamer (not powdered)! The room was furnished lovely - fantastic for us ladies - bright, cheery and in the colour of the season - orange. The room was oversized, extremely clean and exactly what I had hoped for. Need I say, the beds were terrific and rather than enjoying the night out, we decided to stay in! Also loved waking up to the spacious bathroom and huge shower area. We checked out the 9th floor bar as everyone speaks of; enjoyed the view, service and fire box, which kept us warm which made us again think as to whether we should be going out. Wine selection was definitely enjoyed as was again the staff. We did eventually venture out, and found very popular hot spots all within walking distance to the car. Each day we throughly enjoyed mainly because of this fabulous hotel and outstanding service always with a smile and ready to please. Darren at the hotel provided us great tips for places to visit and see, which really made our visit and overall experience. He was as they say the icing on the cake!

Honestly - this Hyatt seems to be more for the business traveler and not so much a family. but believe it or not - because of the location - we would stay there again (I'll just make sure I bring my Tilex).\n",

It is in walking distance of downtown. Across the street from the hotel you have the NCAA national headquarters and the Indiana State Museum. The hotel is brand new and opened in February 2010. It is adjacent to Fairfield Inn and Courtyard By Marriott. All three hotels share an underground garage that sits beneath the hotels. Self parking in the garage is $20/day and valet parking is $25/day. There is a well appointed TGIFriday's located in the Fairfield Inn and you can dine there or have it delivered to your room through room service.\n",
      "The hotel is very well appointed and serves a continental breakfast every morning. Rooms are well appointed and are trendy. Each room has a large Phillips LCD HDTV with plenty of HD channels available. Free internet is available via Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi signal strength is very good and download speeds were 1.5 Mbit consistently. The room has an independently controlled HVAC system with a digital thermostat, microwave, and small cube fridge. The bathroom design is somewhat interesting in that is a split bathroom. The main sink/vanity and tub are in one room and the toilet and small sink are located in another area. The beds were very nice with high quality sheets and coverings. The night stand contained a phone along with an iHome clock radio with iPod Dock.\n",
      "As for other features, a fitness room was available with a variety of equipment available. The hotel features a very small indoor pool that probably could safely fit about 20 people in it. A business center is available where you can check your e-mail and print off boarding passes. The lobby is well appointed with free coffee and wi-fi. The breakfast area was very clean and offered a variety of hot and cold items for breakfast. Typically scrambled eggs and sausage patties were available along with a do-it-yourself waffle machine. A variety of cereals, bagels, and juices were available as well. \n",
      "For dinner, as mentioned previously, a TGIFriday's is located over in the Fairfield Inn. Other restaurants are located in downtown and can be easily accessed by foot, car, or taxi.\n",

To top it all off...I'd mentioned in passing that i was in town for my bday to their front desk receptionist (Abigail) who then sent a free breakfast voucher to my room. So sweet! Then...my flight was cancelled out of LaGuardia and I was already checked out and at the airport when I found out.

      "Text: In town for a wedding and weary from a day of missed flights from the east coast, our first contact at the Huntington was the professional and friendly doorman and bell staff. Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the \"Big 4\" railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the \"Big Four\" Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a \"special occasion\" venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper. Even as we were leaving at 3:30 am to catch our flight back home!\n",

Of special note are the incredible bath robes -- these are not your normal terry towelling jobs, but rather they are soft towelling on the inside, with a kind of brushed suede finish in cream on the outside. Amazingly beautiful robes, and the first I've ever been tempted to buy from a hotel. Truly a one-of-a-kind.\n",

Comparing the Marriott East side to the Hilton on 6th or the W in times square it's easy to give this hotel a rave review. We were just their from Oct 6-9. When we arrive we are always greeting with smiles and hello's. The hotel guest relations coordinator Kenda remembers us everytime we go (about 3 times a year). This particular stay we reserved a Jr Suite with a pull out sofa for our children. When we got to the 6th floor room it smelled of smoke (non-smoking hotel) and the tub was clogged. I called down to the at your service desk and requested a change of rooms due to the fact of an asthmatic child. We were not given the same room but instead the Ambabassador Suite on the 33rd floor. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. My profile with Marriott states that I have an asthmatic child, however I don't feel that this is why I was switched to such a large suite. I believe it is the relations that the staff tries to keep with it's guest. I have never experienced a rude employee at this hotel. Having stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 5 I find that quite amazing. Not sure if everyone knows this, but JW Marriott is the parent company for the Ritz Carlton. As a frequent guest of the Ritz in Boston as well as the Ritz Beach Resort in Naples FL. It is easy to compare this category 7 Marriott to the Ritz. For anyone who expects a LARGE hotel room in NYC should do somemore research, most that I've stayed in have been quite small. I'm sure do to the fact that the city is so populated. Paying over $500 a night was completely fine for what we got (even if our room hadn't changed) Location, just blocks from the best shopping and sites in NYC. The easy highway access and the fact that you are in such a large city and yet at this hotel you get the feel that you are in a neighborhood.

The water pressure was virtually non-existent and when you used the sink, the stopper held the water in the sink. In the shower, it was a tiny bit better. Be careful walking around the room, the bed frame stuck out several inches from the bed, and we banged our shins on it a couple of times.\n",

Everything else was fine with housekeeping.\n",
      "For breakfast we choose the restaurant on the lobby level rather than the continental on the Excecutive Level. The buffet which you may choose instead of a menu item was above-average and opens at 6am.

We handed over the bags, got our claim tickets and you could tell this guy wanted a tip already. In my experience it is customary to tip after you retrieve your bags, not upon dropping them off. Perhaps the normal business clientel throws around money more than we do, but what did he do for a tip...Put a ticket on my bags?\n",

For those of you who have spent time in Manhattan, this is not an issue. For those of you from small towns, I guess it can be unpleasant. Although I was unphased by homeless, there appears to be a large population of mentally ill, homeless people evidenced by screaming, talking to themselves, and in one case, a nude woman all within walking distance of the Hotel (Right across from Hotel Adagio and Cortez restaurant).\n",
      "Every city has homeless, so if it really bothers you perhaps you should not walk around at night? One reviewer suggested giving the homeless money. I am not sure I agree with this and many expect more if you give a little. Again, that comes from growing up around Manhattan. To each their own I guess.\n",
      "One thing I am sure of is that you should not let a few homeless citizens take away from the otherwise great loaction of this hotel.

I booked the hotel four months prior to our stay..................we were supposed to get a two bedroom suite (about $225/night) and three days before leaving, I received an email stating that the hotel had made a mistake, and that room was actually not available on the first night of our stay, but that they could give us two single rooms, and would only charge us $87 for that night for both of those rooms. Then we would be able to choose if we wanted to move into the suite for the next two nights or if we wanted to stay in the single rooms. Initially I was very upset..............they should have at least called to tell me this information instead of merely emailing. We arrived at the hotel around noon, and they provided a safe place for us to leave our luggage until our room was ready. Around 3, we were able to check into the single rooms, and we were pleasantly surprised. Very clean and modern. When all was said and done, we just decided to stay in these rooms, because there was not a thing in the world wrong with them. Plus, it would save us mega $$$. They ended up charging us $87 per room per night, and the first night, we only had to pay for one room, as a way to compensate for their mistake.\n",

Not only did he allow me to spend a few more hours in my hotel room, but he also gave me complimentary drink tickets so I'd have something to do while I waited for my ride.

There seemed to be lines for everything and such tight quarters that people were constantly trying to get by you with trays of food. The food was just so-so. Good pancakes, though. Limp french toast, bland scrambled eggs, overcooked omelets, good crispy bacon. Potatoes consisted of nuggets of deep fried \"tater-tot\" things.\n",
      "* They serve Starbucks coffee in the coffee urns, but it tasted burnt most of the time.\n",

      "Text: I had a free night at any Hyatt from a promotion during the spring, so I used it for a one-night stay on a college visit to Chicago with my teenage son. We were able to confirm only a two twin bed room, but were advised to request two doubles at check-in. We arrived early around 9am, expecting to check our luggage. Despite being sold out on doubles, they checked for two rooms, both with doubles, and said we could check in soon. After about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby; when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready. We went to the room, which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan down the street. Two double beds, a huge bathroom with two sinks, a separate toilet room, an oversized bathtub with a hand-held shower head, and a separate shower room with a rain-type wall mounted shower about 8' up and a separate hand-held. The door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed. I couldn't believe that we had been given a two-room suite, so I called the front desk to check. I was put on hold but got no response so I called back after a few minutes. They first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room, but when I explained that I was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that I had reserved only one room. I locked the connecting doors myself.\n",
      "The room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting. Flat screen TV, i-pod dock, one robe (but two pairs of slippers) in the closet, two toothbrushes and toothpaste, iron, ironing board, shoeshine machine, hairdryer, safe, etc. Minibar, jars of nuts (3 kinds), bottles of imported sparking water, basket of apples. I assume that only the apples were complimentary though. (the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turn-down service -- I guess they really wanted us to buy them.) Extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each, a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman, glass desk with chair, and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate. Complimentary internet access -- wired and wireless, although the latter worked for my son, it didn't for me, There was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked \"internet cable\" in one of the drawers.\n",
      "We checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel. I asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure, no problem. We didn't need to keep our keys because there was open access. We returned around 4:30 pm and went to the pool. Locker room had full-sized lockers stocked with robes and slippers; towels were piles on a rack. Keys were in the unused lockers. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, shaving cream, razors, etc. all available. Two shower rooms, one equipped for handicapped. Large steam room. Three or four lane lap pool, with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters. Small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day. We went to the airport and arrived home late, tired and relaxed. Our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip.\n",
      "I didn't rate value because our room was complimentary. We really appreciated not being treated like second class citizens in any way -- the service was first rate from everyone we encountered. My only two admittedly minor suggestions would be to replace the towels with more fluffy ones -- the ones we had were somewhat thin -- and to add a mirror in the bedroom -- the only mirrors were in the bathroom.\n",

As to be expected, though, the eating area was always very crowded. Our mini-suite was somewhat disappointing, rather small, compared to others in the Express chain we've stayed at. At night the room was quiet even though the daytime traffic was noisy. Service was friendly. All in all, a very nice hotel. A tip for riding the cable car at the turnaround near the hotel - we went later on in the day and there was hardly a wait. Also, we'd recommend the Night Tour at Alcatraz.

      "Text: We have stayed at Embassy Suites in other cities and have always been very happy, so when planning a trip to visit family in Philly, we decided to try this Embassy Suites. I have also never written a negative review, but felt that our experience warranted it. When we arrived, the two double beds that I had reserved were not available and we three adults were placed in a King room. My daughter slept on the sleep sofa, which is probably fine for children, but was very uncomfortable for her, resulting in complaints of back pain throughout the trip. \n",
      "The room itself was fairly clean, but lots of candy wrappers under the sleep sofa, plaster bits around on the rug in both rooms, and some kind of splatter on the walls and lampshade of the main sitting room. I discovered that the plaster was from series of large patches on the wall of the bedroom. That was the view from the bed. The lampshade next to the patched wall also had been crushed. Little things, but felt like I was in a slum. \n",
      " Although we had reserved and paid for three adults, the room was set up for two so we had to seek out glasses and towels each day. The breakfast hosts on all mornings were short tempered (and appeared to be overworked.) The buffet itself could have been ok, but the kitchen obviously had difficulty keeping up with the demand. We waited about 45 minutes for just some oatmeal one morning, and finally gave up and left to buy breakfast elsewhere. There was plenty of bread for toast, cold cereal, muffins, but hard to get healthier options like bagels, fresh fruit, or hot cereal. Coffee ran out 3/3 mornings also. On the mornings that we had a little extra time, we waited but were still not able to get our simple preferences. On the morning that we had to be out by a designated time, we settled for dry cereal and toast. \n",
      "The hotel was very busy and the staff was generally courteous, although if we mentioned any of our concerns, the response was \" We have a large group here today.\" Evidently it was so busy that we often waited 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator up and a couple of times chose to walk down rather than wait. Additionally, the air conditioner/heat unit was incredibly loud, so we had to turn it on for a while, shut it off to sleep, wake up hot, turn it on to cool, then off to sleep. At check out, we were charged for an extra night of parking and after waiting for breakfast, found it irritating to have to wait to resolve the overcharge. We did stop a the manager's reception one night where they served unlimited drinks, potato chips and bags of chex mix. It was nice, although a couple of free drinks and chips certainly does not make up for the inconveniences. The only saving grace for us for this facility was that the location is very good.\n",

After looking up hotels all over town, both on Trip Advisor, and by actually going to each hotel's website, the Donatello won hands-down over all others. I couldn't be happier my selection. The location is convenient to Union Square. The room was spacious, had a very comfortable king-sized bed, a sleep sofa, a kitchenette with a coffee maker and a microwave, as well as some dishes, cups, glasses and silverware - and they don't charge extra for these amenities like many of the hotels in town do - they are included at the price.\n",

My husband had an injury which required surgery to a tendon in his ankle/foot prior to our vacation, so we had a scooter delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival.

They put us in a handicapped accessible room, which was probably a little larger than a regular room. We were very happy with the room that they put us in.\n",

We were in a room right next to the elevators, and didn't have any issue whatsoever with noise from the elevator. In addition, our room was on the 6th floor and faced Post Street. We didn't have any problem at all with noise from the street. The first night, we heard sirens from an ambulance or firetruck, but other than that, no problems whatsoever. The windows are tightly sealed which helps to keep the sound from the street down. \n",

      "Text: Many older hotels are remodelling and upgrading their guest rooms, but not many are investing extra time and effort to give their rooms some style and personality. The designers at the Tomo in Japan Center went out of their way to create rooms that are comfortable and relaxing but also fun to be in, with big hand-painted murals on the walls and artwork suggesting various Japanese pop culture images: Godzilla, Hello Kitty, and various anime characters. Upon arrival I was greeted in the lobby by television monitors showing Japanese cartoons and old Godzilla movies, and I was immediately handed a free sample of cold flavored sake. Definitely the nicest greeting I've ever experienced. The desk clerk honored my request for a room at the back. The room on the 7th floor contained a king-size bed, flat-screen TV (which only got a few channels and even those were fuzzy), and all the stuff you expect these days in a mid-range hotel. The decor was basically modern Japan, with some unusual touches, like the mural depicting a monster (not Godzilla) attacking Tokyo, and a large photograph of a woman's eye. Even with the artwork the room was extremely comfortable, and I knew right away I would enjoy a good night's sleep. The location was so quiet I could have easily kept the window open all night, weather permitting. For a little over $100 this was an incredible bargain for a room of this quality in San Francisco. I parked overnight at the nearby Japan Center for $15, still a great deal. This neighborhood is packed with great restaurants. Between Japan Center and the restaurants along Fillmore you've easily got a week's worth of great dining, all within a five minute walk. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting SF: business travellers, families, honeymooners, anybody. The unique decor (and the low rates) should appeal to anyone.\n",

I would have much preferred to MapQuest my few routes on my own, instead of waiting in another long line for the concierge.) What irked me most about the concierge service was their combined inability to get me the correct details on taking a public bus to Dodger Stadium. (Pick up the #2 or #4 bus from Broadway to the stadium and walk up the hill.) While I realize that most employees and tourists drive to each point of interest, I was traveling from Boston and NYC and sought easy public transportation and walking routes to some sites.

I stayed at the club level and must confess that this was the best thing we did! The breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner spread was one of the best I have seen and tasted! Everything was so yummy and well presented. This was a fantastic value. I visited the spa while at the hotel but decided against services because I was in an exploring mood. I ended up doing a day trip to Napa on my own (rented car from Walnut Creek's Enterprise) and that was lovely. I also headed out into Danville and got a feel for some of the more suburban towns which had great character (I visited friends there too). Overall, the Ritz provided good service - especially in the club lounge- and was in central location. \n",

She encouraged us to ask them for any recommendations or suggestions for places to eat or things to do or really anything. The room was very nice, with a very comfortable bed and nice TV and everything else. It was clean and extremely comfortable, albeit a little small. The location of the hotel is nice, at least in my opinion. It is a little bit away from Cherry Creek Shopping Center and all the bustle that goes with that, but not too far. It is a very easy drive to anything you want to do in Denver. I requested a late checkout the day before checkout, and the front desk was very accommodating, and upfront about the fact that if I wanted to check out later than 3:00pm it would be a half day, but up to there it is not. I appreciated that. Overall, I thought this was a wonderful hotel for under $100 a night. Definitely will go back again next time I want a little getaway in Denver.\n",

Hey, they have to upgrade at some point, right?? And the weirdest thing would have to be when we came back at about 2 AM after the wedding we attended was over, we pulled up and to find the lobby has been transformed into a nightclub. I thought this was very interesting except for the fact that there was about 10 people laying down outside and they were clearly inebriated and ready to puke. I mentioned to my brother that if we were just arriving for the first time right then, I would've been very turned off that such a high class hotel turns into a pukefest nightclub. Don't get me wrong, I think the whole nightclub thing in the lobby was cool...just not the puking guests laying all over the place outside the front entrance.

The hotel itself is fantastic especially the beds and pillows, we would love to know the make of the beds and pillows which are in the hotel as we did not have one bad night sleep or wake up with any pains after all the walking that we were doing between sightseeing and also on the day of the earthquake we had to walk from Union Station to the Hotel. The hotel should be compliemented on all their services which they provide, especially the cleanliness of all the areas within the hotel. Tour bus tickets can be bought in the hotel and stops right outside the hotel which is even better. We would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Washington and the Metro is not to far away for anyone not wanting the tour bus but this is a perfect way to see Washington.\n",

You can’t get that kind of service from big corporate chains – you’d just get an 800 number to call. Communication is key!\n",

      "Text: We spent 11 nights at the Ocean Park Inn and enjoyed every one of them! Yes, there is construction going on in the hotel (they are replacing balcony decks and railings and air conditioners) and next door to it (they are rebuilding the lifeguard tower). We didn't find either project to be excessively noisy, in fact many rooms were closed so the hotel was quieter than it might have been and the flow on the boardwalk was interrupted so it was quieter as well. This hotel was somewhat removed from the \"party\" section of the beach which was great for our family, we only had to walk out our the secure hotel gate and a few feet down the boardwalk to reach the stairs to the beach. The room was very clean, the bathroom somewhat dated but large and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was great as well and they do now offer cream cheese with the bagels. The building is of wood construction so there is some sound transference, we could hear water running and loud discussions if they took place in the bathroom. Most of noise we heard was created by incredibly rude people who felt that having loud discussions in the hallway or letting their kids play soccer there was perfectly acceptable! They rank right up there with the ones who bypassed the handy outdoor shower and went straight into the pool or their rooms, sand and all. The pool was nicely warm and cleaned regularly. There are lots of restaruants nearby, our favorites were Taylor's (right next door) and Joe's Crab Shack (a few doors down). It was easy to drive to the attractions we wanted to see, Sea World was about a 10 minute drive away. Our view was overlooking a very old motel, however we could see the ocean and it was quiet. Our only issue with this hotel is that although it is a totally non-smoking hotel, they allow people to smoke on the balcony with the door closed. As a result we were treated to flicked ashes and the smell of cigarettes on several occasions.\n",

      "Text: My husband surprised me for our anniversary this past weekend by taking me to Hotel ZaZa in Houston. He kept telling me that the hotel was a surprise. I couldn't imagine a hotel being any better than the many thousands of hotels we've already stayed in. I was a flight attendant for over 8 years and felt that if you stayed in one, you stayed in them all. Boy was I surprised. From the moment we pulled up to the hotel, I could tell things we were different. Once we stepped into the lobby, I noticed how upscale the atmosphere was. Surprisingly though, the staff and service was very warm. When I walked into our room, \"That's Entertainment\" concept suite, my mouth dropped. Our room was gorgeous and I loved the theme. The Monarch restaurant was outstanding. The chef came out and spoke to me because I requested to alter a dish. He wanted to talk to me on how he could make my dish taste great with some other ideas on my request. My husband and I were supposed to go out to a club later that night, but we had such a good time at the restaurant, we stayed there all night and partied. We were treated like royalty our entire stay, all the way to the last moment of our stay when a staff member opened my car door for me and gave me a bottle of water. This hotel surpassed all other 4 star hotels I've ever stayed in. We will come back for every anniversary for the rest of our lives. Can't wait 'till next year!\n",

      "Text: If you book a reservation with the Driskill, forget about popular chain hotel experiences. Its not flashy and shiny. Its more - its beautiful, classy and magical. This is a historical experience within a hotel setting. Nice artwork all through the hotel and hallways. We booked the Queen/Queen with window because of the small room factor. Yes, its small but it was clean, cozy and quiet. The beds are so comfortable so much so the middle rod supporting it popped out while we were asleep. The sound woke us up. We laughed, thought about the ghost stories,rolled over and went back to sleep. The bed was still comfortable. 82yr old Mom said \"I had the best sleep\" and she has a pillowtop at home. Our bathroom was large enough to accomodate a wheelchair if necessary, had good lighting, upscale natural products, extra soft towels and they provided a makeup mirror in the bedroom if you needed it. We could adjust the temp of the room. We were in Rm 909 facing out 7th street because we were traveling with my elderly Mom and needed a quiet place. The size of the room helped us out, she didn't feel scared or intimidated when we left her for the concert that evening The staff was great very professional not snobbish. They didn't make me feel out of place and I appreciate that as I was worried about this. I've traveled in and out of country and that has been a sad issue at some hotels that think snobbishness = class. We felt welcomed from the moment we got out of the car to go into the hotel. I was happy to see people of all races/ages enjoying themselves in the piano bar and lobbies for the holidays.They had the largest Christmas tree I've ever seen beautifully decorated. 6th street is youthful too cool. Had to ignore only 1 persistent young panhandler. Felt it wouldn't be a safe idea to show financial compassion so many down. I prayed instead. Music everywhere. After partying I stayed up and read sitting on this wonderful highback chair. State Capitol few blocks over. Good mix of youth and history. Delicious bakery and coffee. Didn't want to leave and going back to stay for a few days for the holidays 2012. It has flavor,character and its deserves all 4 stars. I booked through Expedia got a good price\n",

We called Relax & Rejuvenate spa services to our room for a mani-pedi for her and a massage for me. Jessie & Amy were great!

      "Cons:\n",
      "Have to pay for internet. You could go to 16 street mall to barnes and noble for free wifi, but that can be annoying. Although the worst part of all during my stay was how you can hear everything from your room. Now I understand the hotel can not help this issue, but be mindful when you book a room at this hotel. Request a room that is not connected, unless your staying with a group of people. The problem is you can basically hear everything in the room next door. Not fun when you are trying to sleep at 12:00 in the morning and it literally feels that the people next store are in your room. However, when I complained about the noise the staff was more than accomodating to help, which was really nice and appreciated. Also if you’re staying here it is not really a hotel to stay for leisure because whenever there is a convention going on those people (i.e. the shriners) take over the hotel, which can be annoying at times.\n",

We arrived there and a person helped us with our luggage from the trunk of the car--I gave him a tip but he didn't do much--I thought he would take us to the room--he just rolled the suitcases a few feet from the car to the front desk and left. We were going to a theater at Watertower but the concierge had no idea how to precisely direct us to the door of the theater since Watertower is a big complex. The hotel building is an older Holiday Inn style high rise with small elevators, halls and doorways. The standard room is tiny and there are no mirrors in the main room so if someone is in the bathroom there are no mirrors for the other person. The bathroom is remodelled but the original tub is there only repainted. The bathroom door slides back and forth but it was off the track and didn't slide smoothly. It turns out there was no spa--it was off site, a major disappointment, as we had hoped to book a massage and facial. The fitness facility stairs were closed off with plastic so you had to take the back receiving area, metal service stairs past the garbage smelling kitchen and enter it the back way into a dungeon-like basement area. There were foam cups and a pitcher of water, but the pitcher was empty except for ice. They offered passes for an outside club called Crunch, but this was several cold blocks away also in a basement. There was no supervision in the fitness room, and the one guest working out at the time was blaring one of the ceiling mounted TVs in the room with ESPN, even though his treadmill had its own TV with a headphone jack. The guest would not give the courtesy of turning it down, so you couldn't use your iPod becausee you coudn't hear it over the ceiling hung TV. We ate at the hotel's Primehouse which was excellent. Figure at least $75 per person. In conclusion we thought during that initial call to confirm the reservation they should have told us clearly about the lack of on-premise spa and the workout room construction. I mentioned this at checkout and received $50 off. Yes, the plasma TV was amazing, but all in all I would recommend the Omni for the same price range, and althought we like to try new things, this, like the W Chicago Lakeshore still has the bones of a 1960's Holiday/Day's Inn and you can't cover this up no matter how hard you try. This was not a luxury experience by any stretch.\n",

      "Text: Most of the basics are there, comfortable bed/bedding, good plumbing, acceptable service attitude, and rooms that have aged relatively well. The confirmed Gold Passport Diamond upgrade landed us a Park Executive Suite or at least that was what the front desk agent called it. The 1-BR suite was spacious and contained 1.5 baths, a long sofa, and a square living room table in lieu of a more traditional work desk (no work surface in the bedroom). We took advantage of the loaner bicycles at the concierge. For the cost conscious, the valet parking is $48 per night. Perhaps a way to describe the property location would be ‘near the center of everything, but close to nothing’, except for the independent cinemas on the back side of the hotel, but not a big deal if you are planning to drive everywhere as we were. While I would rate this property ahead of The Williard, in comparison to Park Hyatts in Asia, this location falls way short.\n",

      "For those who can't be bothered to read long reviews, my summary:\n",
      "- Great sleep (quiet and comfortable)\n",
      "- Characterful and friendly\n",
      "- Good price\n",
      "- Good location\n",
      "- Don't eat the carrots\n",
      "For those with more time on their hands:\n",
      "How very, very nice it was to stay in a hotel with some character, rather than the bland formula of an hotel like a Hya-lto-rriott. I found the general feel of the Omni very comforting - like they've been taking care of important people for years and I was in good hands. I might not be considered that important by many other people - but they appeared to find me so, and I enjoyed going along with it.\n",
      "A huge positive point for me was the fact that I slept like a baby. Like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room, in fact. This hotel is made out of good, solid materials, not the usual plasterboard and echo-ey corridors of an ant hotel. I wasn't once kept awake by frisky neighbours, or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms. Good sleep = good mood and good work.\n",
      "In comparison to other business district hotels I found it very reasonably priced. I loved the morning delivery of coffee and juice that was included as part of their rewards programme. Oh, how such small things make such a difference to the way you start your day.\n",
      "Other than that ... friendly, helpful staff and great location for the business district. Although it's a little way from the tourist hotspots, it's no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport ... or, (heaven forbid) use your legs!\n",
      "The one and only issue I stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant - so maybe it's not that fair to post here ... but since the restuarant is affiliated, and there's a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it, I will!\n",
      "The issue? The gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate, reclining in its self-satisfied way against my mightily over-priced and, presumably, very embarrassed steak.\n",
      "That long, lone carrot was, quite honestly, the most revolting vegetable I've ever eaten - and that includes the times I've accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery (food of the devil) in a salad. I can't believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere.\n",
      "If you're a beef aficionado - or even just someone who likes good food - just don't bother. Yes, the steak tasted good ... but not an eye-rolling, conversation-stopping, stress-sapping, umami-ridden explosion of great that I'd expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef.\n",

This was from recommendations by previous Trip Advisor Travellers. We were told by the hotel that they could not guarantee this as the hotel was fully booked. However on arrival we were taken to Room 2904 and we were not to be disappointed. We had one of the most spectacular views that i have ever seen The Chrysler Building and Midtown New York lit up in all its glory. A magnificent sight to go to bed to at night. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were professional and courteous. They even have a pillow menu 5 different types of pillow from soft to hard never had that in a hotel before. The hotel is only 4 blocks from The Empire State Building about 5 to 10 minute walk. About 15 minute walk to Macys and 20 minutes to Times Square/ Broadway. Contrary to reports before we went we found taxis to be clean quick and reasonably cheap. We used one from JFK to our hotel it was cheaper than the train (4 of us were travelling ) 45 dollars which is the standard rate to anywhere in Manhatten plus a 4 dollars 95 cents payment for a bridge toll. A deli that i can recommend for breakfast is Cafe Metro great value and everything cooked fresh and to order in front of you. It is on the corner of 370 Lexington 41st a great start to the day. And anybody wanting a great steak try Juniors at 1515 Broadway and 45th street a famous New York Steak house we had a 20 oz Sirloin with all the trimmings.\n",

I think that the noise would be most noticeable on the north and east sides of the hotel (we faced east), and you might be better on the south or west sides of the hotel if it bothers you.

In fact, it turned out to be probably the most dog friendly of many hotels where we've stayed with the little fella, not in terms of amenities (no dog bowels, blankets, etc., but who really needs them) but insofar as how the staff acted toward him. Which gives rise to the next highpoint-outstanding service. We decided we didn't need /want full housekeeping service on the second day of our stay but did want the garbage emptied. The staff was on the scene within two minutes of our request. Front desk staff politely greeted us by name upon entering and exiting. \n",
      "The decor of the hotel is just as subtly classy as the service. Complimentary juice and coffee are served in the morning and sherry and tea in the afternoon. Some light snacks with the latter-nuts, etc., would be a nice touch. Room service is from a deli (La Taza) two doors down and stops at 7 with what is basically a lunch menu. We just went there and got take out for breakfast (opt for the fruit rather than the burned potatoes) to avoid the service charges. There's another deli (Cafe Encore) two doors down that's open until 8 and has a broader selection of sandwiches and salads that can suffice for dinner but a less appealing breakfast menu. The Farallon, a highly regarded restaurant, is part of the hotel, so it's hard to understand why they don't have room service from it at least for dinner.\n",
      "The room was fine (nice decor, great TV, comfortable beds) but quite cramped for two people and a dog, including a small bathroom. The low speed internet access was adequate for our purposes; higher speed connections are available for a fee. The room was supposed to be one class up from the base (it was about fifteen bucks more per night), but in fact the only difference is you're on a higher floor \"with a view of Nob Hill or Union Square.\" Our \"view\" of the latter was the side of the new tower of the St. Francis. There is a well functioning ceiling fan but no a/c and the window lacked a screen. It was in the low 70s the day we left and you could tell by 11:30 that with the sun coming in through the window (unless you drew the shades) there was going to come a point when the room would get stuffy. As a native northern Californian, I can attest, it can and does get into the 80s several times a year in SF and even the 90s an handful of times. I would suggest checking the 10 day forecast if planning to stay there any time from April through October and if there's a chance of such temps, changing to a hotel with a/c. Noise from Post St. was a real problem; up to 1:30 am on Sunday morning, partiers literally screaming and many sirens. I would imagine that's a problem anywhere you stay in the Union Sq. area. \n",

The pools were great, the bike rentals on sight, the restaurants, quick room service, other activities, ducks and fish all around the property, but most importantly the fire pit on the beach 10 feet from our door and water another 10 feet, this place provided such a wonderful time for us and our 2 year old, that it quickly became one of the best places we have ever visited, and we travel extensively. \n",

We were upgraded all the way to the Presidential Suite, and they saved our vacation which had so been nearly ruined by the Hilton. I can not say enough about this place, and with all that they have done for us, and how we were treated both times, this is my FAVORITE place to stay in San Diego, and should not be missed. We are going back in September. My only mistake in June was not going with Paradise Point to begin with. Don't second guess this place. Find a good rate, go with AAA or Destination Delivers, or call them, but choose this place for a real great vacation.\n",

We had read the reviews and figured for the price and location, we would give it a chance. I am so glad we did. The staff was very friendly, the room was huge with a kithenette and king sized bed. We were minutes from Central Park and Times Square. We didn't use the subway much, instead opted to walk (alot) and also bought a 3 day tour bus pass, the hop on hop off type. So woth the money and it stopped minutes from the hotel door. I would definately stay here again and will recommend it to anyone I know!\n",

So when I had to come to Baltimore for some untidy family business (and my teenage daughter came with me), I tried to mix the situation with at least a nice place to stay near some sights. After doing my homework I chose the Hilton Garden Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor. Not only is it an excellent value with a lovely restaurant that offers a great breakfast, it's a great and safe location that is connected to a SUPERIOR GYM. The rooms are very comfortable with coffee machines, brand new bathrooms, great flat screen and FREE internet connection which no other hotel in the area offers. The staff is up to par with any 4 star hotel. Friendly, courteous, helpful and very professional. I wasn't thrilled that i had to pay twenty some dollars a night for parking but i was thrilled that the parking garage is connected to the hotel so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. The area is surrounded by boutiques, a movie theater, restaurants, little Italy and in walking distance to the shops at the Harbor. \n",

Other than the usual things that the housekeeping staff overlook like the tops of lamps that are layered in dust - I did like the white bed spreads. Usually hotels have some awful pattern to hide the over use. - but these crispy white bed spreads made me feel that they were clean and not hiding anything. The bathroom is brand new and really nice and the shampoo and creams were all Neutrogena which was fantastic. You have a choice of eco friendly pillows and there is coffee maker in the room (LOVE). \n",

This property is lacking in many ways- and sadly a lot of it is common sense. The staff is young and clueless (you should know that the loop of the business park you are in is just a tad more than 0.5 miles, and you shouldn’t be giving out handouts claiming it’s 1.29). Your staff should know how long travel time to attractions (Bank of America Stadium, etc) should be distance and time wise. It’s just sad that they didn’t. There is no exercise room/facility on site, but they do offer day passes to a local gym, but they can’t tell you how close it is. The pool area is only accessible from outside?!?! It’s a nice pool, but nothing special. The breakfast area is small, but I left too early to comment on the amenities. The room is fine and is pretty standard. The sink area indeed is a touch small, but not a problem. The Wifi is a little slow, but not achingly so. The problem with this property is two fold; A.) its new(ish) so the expectation level is higher, B.) the Fairfield brand has undergone major upgrades over the past few years so here again the expectation level is raised. This location looks good, but doesn’t deliver. Too many other choices in the Charlotte area for me to consider coming back.\n",

I emailed the hotel after leaving telling them I was unhappy with this service but not even an apology was received!!\n",

There was a mini bar, microwave and a safe. Soft and comfortable beds with clean and fresh linen. All in all the rooms were good. Unfortunately we decided to have breakfast downstairs one morning.

The Diner/Cafe (sorry can't remember the name) had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also.

The location is prime - there is a subway station just one block north from the hotel. We stayed in a room with a double bed and a private bathroom. It was small but manageable. It was decorated nicely, something you'd expect a suffragette to stay in during the early 1900s. There was a TV, a very efficient heater, and A/C. The rooms were cleaned each day very nicely. The hotel itself was quiet the entire time. Only on Saturday night did some street noise filter in, but we turned on the air to low and it was blocked out. Be sure to book your room through the internet or with the internet price on hand over the phone - it's much cheaper. The staff was friendly and the iron and ironing board I borrowed from them worked well. My only quip is that the man who checked us in gave us an uncomfortable and bothersome stare and remark about my boyfriend and I sharing a double bed. He wasn't hostile, but you sure don't expect it less than a mile from where the Stonewall riots took place. Also, the elevator is small but quaint with its archaic gated door. All in all, a great, great, great place for those people who don't need to be pampered and overcharged but enjoy sleeping in comfortable and quiet hotels.\n",

The meeting room had floor to ceiling windows and a view of the water, which added to our experience (since we spent the majority of our time in the room). We had meals catered in the room and ate one meal at Miel (one of the restaurants onsite) and the food was delicious. We used the concierge quite a bit for reservations and the business center for some copying needs - both services were excellent.

The staff were nice, the decor was great, the room was clean. I really have no complaints. We requested a higher up floor (which by the way, makes NO difference in outside sounds!) and they accommodated us with no issue. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. It seems as though they added lighting to the rooms, they weren't dark like the other reviews said. The lobby is dark and the hallways are dark, but we never found it to be an issue. It's in an amazing location, half a block to the 59st/Columbus Circle subway and just as close to Central Park. There are 2 parking garages on the street, Central and Icon, print out a coupon online and it's $15-20 cheaper than their $55 valet at the hotel!\n",

We explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on 3rd day to Jersey City and would this change? No, SORRY, that is the reply! I found this VERY DISCRIMATING as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay, otherwise, once your stay is over, SORRY, you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem! In my prior stay of hotel like Sheraton Vancouver, they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding . This is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at Penn Station. So, apart from this issue of not able to hold our 1 piece luggage since we have no pending reservation, which I found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an UNHELPFUL hotel meeting guest needs.\n",

      "Text: Almost 5 years ago, I gave this place two huge thumbs up. I decided to return to see if my experience could be replicated. It was not, it was exceeded!!! As usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do. I booked late and through a third party site, during a very busy time in NY. While I was prepared for a broom closet with a bed, I was upgraded without request upon arrival. Later in my stay I met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in NY. I had to come back to the city the following week, and mentioned this to the manager as I was checking out. I had checked the 3rd party site, but the City Club wasn't showing any availability. Not only did the manager secure a room for me, but also at an extremely competitive price. He also gave me his card. I shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and BOOM. Another upgrade, this time to the two story suite. All I can say is don't die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach, boast two story windows, and a spiral staircase that is ultra hip....amazing, and would be well worth the standard suite price. Let me give 2 more quick asides about this place. 1. I was running late when i realized that I had forgotten a toiletry item. A call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes - this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel. Larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time. 2. The front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived. Then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and I should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room. The City Club is still in a great central location, with great design, and amenities, but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom. My wife wants to see the Yankee's in the playoff's for our Anniversary. Anybody wanna guess where we'll be staying? \n",

      "We were in Vegas, and the extreme weather on the East Coast cost us (and thousands others) their flights, initenerary's, schedules, time and money. We finally decided that if we could go across to the East Coast only 5 days later, we were not going to spend another 4 in Vegas, so we decided on a last minute trip to San Fran. And everyone who has been there will vouch for this decision.\n",
      "So, we had to finalize everything double quick, or risk getting stuck when we reached San Fran (or hang around the San Fran airport till (and if) we got something decent in our budget). There were too many variables and too little time and even less money after the weather tossed all plans up.\n",
      "So we accessed trip advisor at McClarren's and looked for the best rated in value for money propositions after fixing a budget of 50 bucks a day. My hubby saw the Opal, the review and the price, decided to go up by 10 bucks more a day, and booked it.\n",
      "And it was beautiful.\n",
      "The service at the reception and in the rooms, was courteous and thoughtful, and the 3 or 4 people rotating at the front desk all looked like old and experienced hands (which, at times, may come at the expense of courtesy). \n",

      "The breakfast was a basic fare, but the room and location was brilliant. Amenities were pretty basic, but way more than what we expected, considering what we were ready to pay at that time.\n",
      "All in all, we got really lucky with this one. The location, price, look and feel and the service were worth quite a bit more than we paid. And we had just come in from Circus Circus in Vegas, so it felt even better.\n",

Needless to say I asked to see the \"suite\" we booked before presenting our credit card. The friendly desk clerk obliged with no problem. The rooms were small as advertised, but clean. The bathroom was miniscule, but adequate, and spotlessly clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows were of high quality. There was no sign of any bugs, either cockroaches or bedbugs. Our rooms were freshly painted and there was no sight of peeling paint anywhere. I slept like a baby with the window open. The second night I asked the desk for another blanket and it was on my bed upon my return. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The subway is two short blocks away, and cabs were easily caught on West End Avenue, a block away. If your plan is to find inexpensive accomodations and are travelling with a friend or with children, the suite at $109/night is unbeatable. The two rooms connected by the bath gave us privacy we could have never had in a standard double room. I will stay here again.\n",

We arrived Thursday and attended the free evening buffet with drinks (you don't usually get that in NY) which was great as we had just arrived, after that we went to the nearby Duanne Reade for some milk and nibbles. Our room was amazing two double beds, kitchen area with full size fridge/freezer and everything you could possibly need, the bathroom was plenty big enough with a shower in the corner and the water was always hot. We always had clean towels and our cups and coffee maker were always cleaned while we were out. Breakfast was fine and we always found a table to eat it, didn't need to take it to the room although some people chose to do so, we found it an opportunity to chat to other guests. I had noticed before leaving the UK there were comments about the street the hotel was in, as two females on our own we felt very safe and never once felt threatened or uncomfortable, the shop selling sexy lingerie and sex toys made us laugh, not that we went in, just what we saw from the door as we passed and in the window! The parole office was just another place no shady characters around that I saw, but then I wasn't looking to find anything wrong with the area!! We didn't find it noisy at all and were on the 12th floor overlooking the Port Authority bus station.

The grounds were beautiful and so peaceful. We had a room in the Fountain building. There were at least 1/2 dozen fountains or so in this area with running water that was very soothing. The pools were very nice. Restaurant was pretty good. I believe it was called the Verandah but not sure. My daughter liked the children's menu. I had the buffet one night which was pretty good but could have been a lot better for the price. The paella was probably the worst I've ever eaten with sticky, sticky rice, and the puff pastery that the swordfish was cooked in was chewy. I had to pick it off just to get to the fish. My husband had one of the few chicken dishes which he thought was fair. Breakfast buffet was good which was included in our room rate otherwise it would have been $50.00 for the three of us. My only real complaint about this hotel is that the beds were as hard as a rock! I had the hardest time falling asleep the first night and that was after a few glasses of wine. I would hardly call the room that I stayed in a 4 star. The decor was a little boring though the bathroom was nice. To me it seemed the room needed updating...especially those beds.

I was nervous at first because I saw this whole huge story about some major GOP convention having been there in January and everyone having bedbug bites. Understandably I kind of freaked out and I contacted the management with my concerns. They replied promptly and courteously, gave me quite a bit of info on how they deal with those kinds of situations and apparently the story was rather unfounded. So we decided to give it a shot. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the extremely nice front desk staff and allowed to check in 2 hours early. Our room was neat and clean (with the exception of one old pillow which I removed from the bed). We inspected every inch of the room for bedbugs and found absolutely nothing. Everything was spotless. True, as many reviewers before have pointed out, there was no view from the room and the towels were scratchy but I wasn't there to gaze out the window and the towels were clean so I didn't care. I didn't observe any nasty attitudes from any of the hotel staff despite having read reviews about it before going. In fact, every person on staff that I dealt with was exceedingly nice and helpful.\n",

Check-in was a piece of pie, and they were able to get my entire family checked in early, which was a HUGE bonus. They have a very nice lobby/lounge where they have complimentary drinks all day (and wine in the evening). We were all upgraded to suites and the rooms were magnificent and the beds are probably THE most comfortable I've ever slept in! The decor is very modern and sleek. I have to say that one of the manager's (Iris) is so friendly and accommodating - you cannot go wrong if you are lucky enough to get to work with her on anything you might need. \n",

Whilst waiting, it was evident that the professionalism and level of service had not changed as the guests before us were being dealt with quickly by the very helpful front desk staff.\n",
      "I am happy to report that the hotel is still as excellent as it was a year ago. When our turn to check in arrived, we were welcomed back, this being our second stay at the hotel.

It had two queen beds that were extremely comfortable as well as a large pull out sofa and kitchenette. We requested a handicap room and the bathroom was wonderful. It was very large, with a roll-in shower. The pool was clean as well as the area surrounding the pool. Everything was well maintained at this property. The free breakfast was delicious with lots to choose from, including a fantastic waffle maker. You could eat indoors or outside. They were in the process of setting up a nice little \"bar\" area in the lobby while I was there. They have two computers in the lobby that you can use for free. Elevators were spacious and fast. The staff were outstanding. I'm sorry I didn't get the name of the lady who was extremely helpful in getting our handicap room keys so I could mention her here. There was a gentleman named Kevin who was also very nice and helpful (the shorter of the 2 Kevin's). The best part was the location. You walk out the door and right onto the $1.00 trolley downtown to Beale St. or you could walk (10 mins - I timed it twice). It was on a very lovely tree lined street with a park across the street as well as a Walgreen's and great restaurants. Sam's (on the corner) had a wonderful chicken breast sandwich & fries for $6.50! Another restaurant on the next corner called \"The Flight\" (I think) was also very nice - a little more elegant and a little more pricey but very good food - $11-$26 for chicken or steak dinner, depending on the size you order. Beale St. had a great bar called \"Wet Willie's\". I highly recommend this property!\n",

I booked five nights on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the bed. It's better than the one I have at home and mine is a very high quality mattress. The room was spotlessly clean and the bath area had been recently remodeled with very high quality tile (and a pattern even). It was a suite-sized space, with a love seat, king bed, fridge, microwave, CD player and DVD player. Now, for the fun of the place.... When I turned the lights off at night, stars glowed on the walls and the ceilings. There was a blacklight and some really neat murals on the walls. When I came the first time, I had asked for bedside lights to read by since the room didn't have any. I also could not get wireless, plus had a broken bathplug. When I came to my room later the same day as mentioning it to the manager, the tub was fixed, I had a hardwire cord in my room for internet and two bedside lamps. I was so impressed! Any property can have issues, but it's how quick they are addressed that makes such a difference. This was whiplash fast! Now for the really good part. I came back two weeks later for an overnight trip. When I arrived to check in, the same nice manager had the same room reserved for me. He greeted me warmly and said he had the room I liked, the lamps and the internet ready for me. I was so touched to see what a great memory he had and how helpful he was! You know, it's really great to have people care about what they do and to do it the best they can. I travel a lot for business and I must say that I really feel welcome here, like my business matters. You don't get that much these days, especially for a such a great value.\n",

It gave us time to walk around the hotel and have lunch in the resturarant. We found everything very pleasant. When I inquired again about our room 1.5 hours later we were told that it wasn't ready yet. Still way before the 3:00 check in time so we decided to take a walk outside just as we were about to leave the premises one of the desk staff ran outside ( in about 30 degree weather) to catch up with us to tell us that our room was indeed ready. That is what I call service. The entire staff from the doorman to the maids were always pleasant and accomandating. I would absolutely recommend the hotel. There are a number of resturants within walking distance and the zoo is a short 4 blocks up the street. It is a short cab ride away from the National Mall and monuments ( $15. each way) but nice because it is away from the hustle and bustle. The room was enormous and clean and as a Omni Select Choice member were given complimentary beverages each morning and for a few dollars extra able to order a bagel or muffin which was just enough to hold us over until lunch.

The staff make the hotel. They were friendly, courteous and very helpful especially Michael on the front desk. The door guys were really friendly and helpful too. \n",

As a plat member, was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin (which is more spacious, got an extra window balcony to sit on). However, was travelling with friends so I requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead, no problems.\n",
      "Lobby: The staffs were friendly and efficient, the lobby is very hip/chic just like what you would expect at the typical W hotel. I like the hotel ambience espcially at night, so pretty. You'll see many people hanging out at the lobby XYZ bars at night time (There's a DJ there too). There's an Acura MDX Experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an one-way ride to most of the places in SF area (except airport, of course) and we did take advantage of it during our stay. The drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus. But due to the popular demand, I recommend reserve your time spot early!\n",
      "The Gym: Very nice, with complete sets of eplical machines, weights, and the swim pool /jacuzzi is right outside of the gym (which is very hip looking too). The gym opens 24/7 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm. Bliss Spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their mani/pedicure and other services but I did not get to try it out so I am not going to commend on that.\n",
      "The Room: Some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation (so for those who hates siren at night, you should request a room away from the firestation). Good AC (very quiet), and the lights in the room are very nice too. The bed is the typical W bed, not as heavenly as the Westin Heavenly Bed but certainly better than Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and other competitor's bed. I actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after I stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep. That tells you how much I like their bedding. The room is towards the small size (~300 sq ft?) but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff. The shower pressure is good, not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean. Toiletries is the standard Bliss Sinkside 6 (lemon sage scent) which is one of my favorite hotel product. One thing, the bathroom door has no lock and its very clear/see thru!! so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it! This is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey, its W so you need to be more open minded about it. Turndown service available on request every evening.\n",
      "Parking: $42/night, 1/2 off if you drive a hybrid. Since its SF, I did not drive, its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isn't it? Also, internet (WiFi) are free at the lobby so you'll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day.\n",
      "Overall: This is a good, well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more \"freshier\" look instead of the dark depressing color. Some people liked it, some don't. Of course, the price can be high for most people (at least 200+/night) but if you want to have fun, meet people or just want to enjoy the W scene, you should give this property a try. Don't stay there if you want a QUIET weekend getaway. W is all about fun :D\n",

Though no rates are cheap for New York hotels, the above-mentioned amenities must be factored into the price, as their being included would add a hefty sum in a different hotel. The only small gripe I might mention is that, when serving breakfast in the large chafing dishes each morning, the eggs, bacon, etc. have gotten lukewarm or cool after a short while. This might be remedied by having a source of heat under each large chafing dish, similar to the stern that is put under fondue pots. Other than this small item.

The room was actually a 1 bedroom apartment, very clean, roomy, stocked with cooking utensils, pots/pans, dishes, even a full size stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Myke Syn, the chief engineer who helped us with our internet connection and helped us load our luggage when the shuttle bus picked us up. Just around the corner is a CVS where we purchased a few groceries and sodas, which saved us a bundle of money.\n",

      "Text: The Omni Shoreham is a welcome respite in a fast moving city, and I would definitely recommend it in the summer months, if you want a combination of a resort and a city hotel. It was really nice to come back to this beautiful hotel and relax at the pool - which was incredible - complete with drink and food service, and a 24 hour fitness center. We booked two rooms (one a suite), and the hotel accommodated us nicely, placing the rooms next to each other. We did enjoy our stay - even though we had the misfortune of being there two nights when fire alarms went off (the week prior to 4th of July). Being an Omni Select member, I expressed my dissatisfaction and insisted that I would only be happy if fully compensated for the nights that were interrupted by the alarms. I know others reviewed this hotel and were very unhappy with the fire alarm situation, but to tell you the truth, the hotel did deal with it well - in my situation - maybe becauseI was more assertive in expressing what I expected of them! Thus, I am still rating the Omni 5 stars, and I hope the they have corrected the faulty alarm system, so that no one has to experience being evacuated without just cause. In summary, I would give this advice to my fellow travelers: If you are at all dissatisfied with a stay, be professional and polite and express yourself. If you don't get the answer you are looking for, make sure you are dealing with the manager. If you still don't get the answer you are looking for, write to a manager in the corporate office. That usually works, especially if you are a frequent guest of that particular hotel chain.\n",

And, late in the afternoon, a staff member comes and offers lemonade and popsicles to the people in and around the pool - free of charge! Upon arrival to Magic Castle, the reception staff offer champagne flutes with lemonade in them.

I informed the front desk staff that we would have to check out a day early and they were very understanding. A few minutes after I had gone back to my room, one of the staff knocked on the door and gave us a little card they had made for us, saying they hoped our cat would be alright. They also gave us a little stuffed mouse for her to play with.\n",

      "Text: The great Broadway composer Alan Jay Lerner used to quote Sibelius – ‘in all the cities, in all the towns, in all the villages all over the world, no-one has ever erected a statue to a critic’. So whatever I write about the Doubletree Guest Suite on Times Square has to be personal and subjective. I happen to like New York. And am here several times a year. When I stay with more than one person I aim for the Doubletree. It really is very good value for two people who like each other a lot, but not too much. There is plenty of room; and surprisingly, not much sound leakage between the internal rooms in the suite. The check-in was smooth and friendly and the first room we offered seemed fine – away from elevators and ice machines as requested – but it had an adjoining door to the suite next door. Avoid. Two of God’s Little Ones decided 8.00pm was the time to scream. So having just checked in and unpacked, we asked to be moved. The Front Desk and then the Duty Manager could not have been less sympathetic. Yes, they changed the room without question, but we had to go to the new room with no question of a porter being offered to bring the new key and help to move bags. I later spoke with the Assistant Front Office Manager who was positively hostile, implying it was my fault the children were screaming in the room next door. She was a real let down to the Hilton chain. And then we moved rooms. It was fine and, phew!, quiet. Of course, the safe didn’t work but an engineer fixed it within minutes. Likewise a clock radio, ditto. When a good hotel fails, it responds well and promptly. The Doubletree did just this. And that night when we returned to our room, late, there was a bowl of fruit and chocolate with a hand-written apology from the Duty Manager. A classy solution to the earlier unhappiness. Would I recommend this Doubletree Guest Suite? Absolutely, quiet, roomy, friendly and at the crossroads of one of the most exciting destinations in the world.\n",

They were soooo nice and accomodating from my boy D money at the door, to the ladies at reception, to my new friend Greg in housekeeping and my other friend Ricky. Any questions or request we had were answered and fulfilled. They had us smiling and laughing the whole time. We really appreciated all the information they provided us with about where to go and what to do. When I come back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Palomar again.

While we were still pulling in looking lost at 11p trying to make sure we were in the right spot, two valets appeared, one on each side of the car and gently whisked away the car keys and our luggage and took care of everything!

      "Amazing location - The hotel is located at the entrance of the Windsor/USA. tunnel - this provides easy access for Canadians. Being on the waterfront afforded nice views. Lastly, the property is directly linked to the People Mover -- we were able to get to Joe Louis Arena quickly and safely for $0.50/ person (note: also got to Comerica Park using the People Mover -- for more info: visit thepeoplemover.com )\n",
      "Amazing property - The inside of the hotel is quite nice. The facility is modern, clean and architectually stunning.\n",
      "Great access to restaurants and shops - All without leaving the building -- there is a Starbucks on the concourse level and a small convenient store located in the lobby. This is in addition to the restaurants/bar located on the property.\n",
      "Great room - very clean and modern with great bedding and a nice shower.\n",

      "The heating system for the room was unusally loud. It might have been a problem for light sleepers. It was not really an issue for us.\n",
      "While the Renaissance Center is quite beautiful, it is also very complex... it might take a while for a visitor to figure out how to get around the facility.\n",
      "In-room high speed internet seemed pricey at $9.95 per day.\n",
      "Advice:\n",
      "If visiting this hotel from from Toronto (or SW Ontario) -- Take the 401 thru Windsor instead of going thru Sarnia. The trip is much more straightforward (and as mentioned before, the hotel is located right at the entrance to the tunnel).\n",
      "Take the People Mover everywhere. It is significantly cheaper than taking a cab.\n",

They pool was only open until 10pm and for the parents who wanted a drink it was so crowded, but the time we got up there and got one drink we were being kicked out.

The Ace Hotel is moderately priced (by NYC standards), recently remodeled, clean, and features excellent service by a friendly staff.\n",
      "I liked the offbeat motif of the hotel. As it could be described as “stark,” it will not be everyone’s cup of tea. One person’s “starkness,” however, is another person’s “bold statement”; and in any case the industrial appearance is only a style; the hotel does not lack comfort or amenities (although at the time of my visit it did not have its own restaurant; they do, however, provide room service using the resources of nearby restaurants; and they serve a breakfast of croissants and coffee). All this fits in with a corporate sense of humor that includes its motto, “Thank you for sleeping with us.”\n",
      "One disclaimer about this review: I received a free upgrade due to the unavailability of the class of room I had booked. I don’t know what my cheaper room would have been like; but the room I got had a refrigerator, coffee-making supplies, a manual pencil sharpener (more of that sense of humor!), a guitar (I didn’t check to see if it was functional), and some op-art-ish wallpaper to offset the mostly black-and-white décor. There was a flat-panel TV and a feature-packed but austere-looking clock radio into which one could plug personal audio devices.\n",

Well, let me qualify that by saying that the couple of massages we got were actually not that great, but then we discovered Sascha and Eida and we were hooked. Be sure to ask for them or you may be as disappointed as we were at first. Prices range as do the rooms, but there's something there for everyone.

      "Text: Corny but accurate. We visit SA frequently as we only live 80 miles north. We've stayed at many Riverwalk hotels and while there's some worthy competitors the Westin is our favorite. The staff is well trained and friendly (unlike a competitor one block east). The spa while under promoted and hidden down a hallway was fantastic.Two thumbs way up to Dora for the wonderful massages! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and of course the heavenly bedding is wonderful. The only negative is that both the pool area and health club are in need of a face lift if not a makeover. The gym has far too much equipment jambed into a small room off the pool. If you use the treadmills (which we both do) you'll feel like a sardine with the stranger next to you being only inches away. I'm a retired pool builder so a little hypersensitive about pool areas but this is a residential size pool serving a large hotel so managing families with guests who like a quieter pool scene is difficult. Perhaps management can come up with a creative solution because if you like to lay around the pool, have a beer and read a magazine then you'll find the half a dozen screaming kids (the parents of which do nothing to control) just a little irritating. The pool area itself is overdue for a serious cleaning. The concrete decking was filthy, some sling chairs need replacement and there were only enough terry cloth covers for about 6 of the chaise lounge chairs. The bartender and bar were nice but Westin needs to give this area some attention because while the hotel is 4 stars the pool area comes in around a 2.5. Unless you spend 100 percent of your stay around the pool you won't be disappointed at the Westin.\n",

Location is good--it's halfway between the F/V (6th and 23rd) and 1 (7th and 28th) subway stops, although the 1 is slightly closer. There are convenience stores, drugstores and restaurants just steps away: CVS and Duane Reade on 6th, Chipotle and BRGR on 7th. I recommend Supermac on 7th just south of 29th: multiple varieties of macaroni and cheese. \n",
      "Received an \"upgrade\" on arrival to a king bed on 14. Small, NY style room, and really tiny bathroom (bathroom even tinier than the ones at the Radisson Lexington). But everything was clean and comfortable. Flat-screen TV with many stations, about 1/3 of which didn't come in. FREE INTERNET! (Wired or wireless--I went with wired--but be sure all the ethernet cables are connected properly.) I had no noise problems--I could only hear people if they were in the hall outside my door. It was super cold during my stay, and it was kind of hard to keep the room warm because the cold kept radiating from the window, but it was better the last day when it got up to freezing. Staff was pretty friendly for a NY hotel, greeting all the guests as they got off the elevators (no long elevator waits, either). The bartender even changed a $100 for me. The only problem I had was one day when I left my room at noon, it was not cleaned when I got back. I called down and someone came right up and changed the towels and made the bed. I appreciated that; I've had hotels tell me I was out of luck before when that happened.\n",
      "All in all, I would recommend this place to a single traveler especially--but probably not families due to the size of the rooms. Maybe a couple. I don't know what the two-bedded rooms were like.\n",

The staff was great, they knew exactly how to explain where to go, and the rooms were spotless. The AC was cold, the rooms were big, the beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were clean and the location was perfect. You are 1 block away from some outstanding bars and restaurants in the area. The parking garage was connected and the blocks are short...not like the long NYC blocks. The hotel is about 5 miles from Citizens Bank Park and in the Arts district where it is clean and safe. As an added bonus, Doubletree is only 1 mile from two of the most famous Philly Cheesesteak places (Pat's and Geno's). Next time I go to Philly I am going to go right for the Doubletree!!! Very impressive and very reasonably prices. You will not go wrong staying here.\n",

Over all im happy to recommend it, though, especially if you get a deal on the room. Pros: No. 1 decor and ambience. This was the overriding factor in my view. Paul S. picked up here where he left off at the royalton and paramount. Trendy chic ultra-modern. The lobby, library and main bar are amazing. A lot of the hotel is dark wood with brick in the lobby, but the bar is a riot of color, with an illuminated floor. The entire package makes u feel that staying there is an experience, not like marking time in the generic, dated, boring hyatts, sheratons and marriotts. The people who hang out there are amazing, btw, its all you woud exect from a hip NY hangout. \n",

ConsNo.1 THe room really was tiny. Laughable, really. I was travelling solo, so It was ok, and the amenities were fine. Had an iron and board, CD player, safe etc. \n",

I thought that the window was open, the street noise was so loud. And I heard noise from neighboring rooms at times, but it wasnt terrible.No. 4 not enough plug sockets in the room. No. 5 There was an exercise room, but I would have prefered a far better health club.

I am actually a bit overwhelmed by what I refer to as the \"Alice in Wonderland\" decor - gold and purple walls, green and purple carpet, green doors, high-backed abstractly shaped chairs, etc. It is a bit like something out of Wonderland, although one of my colleagues swears it reminds him of South Beach...The bathroom is non-exceptional - combination shower/tub, nice long counter, and typical lousy hairdryer (I SO wish hotels would give consideration to their female clientele). There are no refrigerators in the rooms, but when I requested one it was promptly brought up for me. The king size bed is comfortable and includes a multitude of pillows of varying firmness and fill. My HVAC unit is on the noisy side (with no option for continuous fan) but this is also not uncommon in older rooms.The breakfast buffet is typically overpriced ($12 for fruit, cereal, pastry, etc.); however, the fresh berries are a nice touch (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries - all available). Again, the service was very attentive. Lastly, on week nights there is Crabby Happy Hour that consists of homemade crab dip and free beer/wine.

      "Text: After a few not so great experiences at the hotel I normally stay at while in NYC, I took advantage of Jetsetter's sale to obtain a room at the Surrey for an unbeatable rate to see if I should make the Surrey my new business hotel. The first thing that raised my eyebrows about the Surrey was that it doesn't have the same buzz as some of the other hotels in its category such as the Park Plaza, St. Regis or Athenee. However, as I came to find, the Surrey was every bit as luxurious as some of the other boutique hotels but without the crowds and traffic.\n",
      "I will say that I probably won't be booking the Surrey when using Jetsetter again because it was a total logistical nightmare. Normally, with my busy schedule it is very hard to follow up on a hotel booking but it seemed that the Surrey was having some major issues with the Jetsetter site because it took at least 7 emails back and forth with the very helpful GM, Spencer to lock down the day I needed as Jetsetter kept saying it was unavailable and would not show the reservation. I was told there were some issues with the hotel's reservation computer system which might have accounted for the glitch.\n",
      "However, once I actually got to the Surrey, all the hassle I went through making the reservation was worth it. I was upgraded to a fantastic room with a small sitting area and plenty of space. The hotel staff couldn't have been any nicer or friendlier. One of the ways I always judge a hotel is by how the staff treats the guests. From the desk clerks to the doormen to the GM himself, you will be treated as a valued guest here and the staff will go out of the way for you if you make a request.\n",
      "The thing that stood out the most to me was the bed. It was amazing ... without a doubt the best bed I've had at any hotel in NYC. It had extremely nice bedding, including one of the nicest down comforters I've seen ... I forgot to ask where I could buy one when I was checking out of the hotel. I was only there for one night during a worldwind schedule, so its too bad I did not get to use it more. There are plenty of pillows as well, which are not too firm or soft.\n",
      "The room is very tastefully decorated. Normally, I do not love grey, white and black color schemes because I feel they are not very warm and semi-depressing however, the Surrey did it right. The room felt classy and comfortable without feeling too blah. The bathroom was also one of the biggest I've had in NYC with a nice shower that had a great double head and awesome water pressure. The marble and mosaic made it feel very classy. The toiletries were nice and plentiful.\n",
      "One thing I did not use that I thought was cool was instead of the nip-sized bottles in the typical mini-bar ... the Surrey offers bottle service in the room. For $45 - $55 you can buy a 350 ml bottle of liquor (enough for 3-4 drinks) and a bartender will come to your room with the mixers, etc. and mix your first round and leave you the accoutramonts for the other drinks you will make. There are about 15 different drinks you can choose to go with depending on the bottle you choose.\n",
      "The location is great. Those who want to be closer to Broadway/Times Square would not want to walk there and back as it took 30 minutes at a fairly brisk pace to make it to Broadway. It is a short cab-ride to that area and they are pretty good about calling you a cab because this hotel is fairly removed from the action, so cabs aren't plentiful. The location is in a residential part of Central Park. 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue are only a 10 minute walk and because it is so close to Central Park, the walk is not bad. I prefer staying here as opposed to staying more in the 'action' because it is very quiet and laid back ... not at all hustle and bustle. It almost feels like being in a residential neighborhood, which is probably why the price is a bit higher than some comparable hotels.\n",
      "I found the rates to be reasonable ... mid-April seemed to be in the $400 - $500 range for a standard room. You could stay at the W for much less, but I wouldn't say the two are comparable in terms of the luxury bedding/service, however the vibe is similar. One thing I didn't like as much is that if you are traveling with a business partner, they do not have many rooms available at the entry level price range with two beds. I was told upon checking in, the only room they had available with two beds was a junior suite, which would cost $795 per night. The regular rate for an entry level room was $495 at the time.\n",
      "I did not use the restaurant or bar at the hotel. The lobby isn't as spacious as it looks on the website, however it isn't as busy as a lot of other hotels, so that isn't really a problem. I did notice that the staff at this hotel do not beg for tips as they do at a lot of the other full service hotels in the area. At many hotels I stay at for business, it seems like one person takes your bags out of the car, one person wheels them into the hotel, one person parks the car and another person takes the bags to the room. I didn't really find that at the Surrey. I was at the Barclay during this trip as well and was literally chased down into the street by a bellman who moved my bags from my room a few hours earlier who wanted to let me know that it was him that moved my bags earlier that morning.\n",
      "If you have some money to spend and enjoy being outside of the action in a more laid back area, the Surrey is for you. I will say that after several years of staying at their nearby rival hotel, I am making the Surrey my new home for business travel in NYC. I would describe my stay here as luxurious and relaxing and thank the staff and GM for making my business/personal trip so enjoyable.\n",

      "Second, since the shower was a walk-in, glass enclosure that meant there was no tub ledge to sit things on. There was one tiny ledge that would hold a bar of soap, but otherwise you have to put all your toiletries on the shower floor which means a lot of bending over to pick up bottles. Again, normally not a big deal but the neck injury made it very annoying.\n",

      "Text: Just celebrated my birthday in Austin at the W in late March. From the moment I walked in I felt like a celebrity. Their customer service was second to none. The \"icing on the cake\" was coming back to my room the night before my birthday to a great piece of cake and a bottle of champagne! I would recommend this place if you want to feel what luxury feels like! Awesome place!\n",

      "Title: “First trip to New York”\n",
      "Text: My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on December 19-23, 2011. We arrived at the hotel before 10:00am and was able to check in at this time. When we arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was that the room was small. The queen sized bed took up much of the room. The bathroom was even smaller. The bathroom door could not open all the way because the toilet was in the way. Since this was our first trip to NYC, we were not in our room much. Generally, we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner. The hotel is a very nice hotel. The concierge was great. Meg, was the person we dealt with and she is VERY knowledgeable about everything NYC. The doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi. The room service people were never seen yet every time we came back to our room, everything was cleaned and straightened up. They say, whomever they are, the best way to tell if the hotel was good, is if the people who stayed at the hotel would so again. I would not hesitate to stay there again. It was a great experience.\n",

      "Text: Definitely one of the nicest hotels I've ever set foot in! Very new, very impressive! The beds were comfortable, the room was comfortable (although a little tight for four women who don't pack light!), everything was great!\n",
      "I don't know how long this hotel has been open, but the rate we had for one night (on a Saturday!) was pretty fantastic. Therefore, there was a bachelorette party in the room across from us, and two rooms full of boys celebrating someone's birthday about 10 rooms down from us. We didn't hear anything from the bachelorette group (they had only decorated the door with ribbon and that's how we knew) but the boys decided to throw out one of the guys for a little streaking. Even though it was 11PM, probably still a bad idea!\n",
      "I would definitely stay here again and I definitely recommend this hotel to others!\n",

      "Text: The view from my room looks out over the bay and I see all the key sights. Very comfy beds with great linens and pillows, also very clean. It's fantastic if you have to work a bit because the desk looks out over the amazing view. Hotel staff is very helpful and nice. Only problem is the key card to the room is super sensitive and I have to try it several times to get it to open. Great location for China town... and I do love Chinese food! I totally recommend staying here.\n",

      "Text: I made my reservation online at the Bijou because it said that the last person who'd reserved lived in France. Turned out to be an excellent choice, and it is mostly Europeans who seem to stay there. They know bargains, comfort and chic, obviously. The hotel is very well kept up and the staff is friendly, PLUS you get a free breakfast buffet thrown in with your $60 a night double! They also show old movies in a charming little theater, though you won't have time to watch them--the hotel is conveniently located near everything in downtown San Francisco--two blocks to Market Street, three to Powell for a cable car, about the same for Union Square, not to mention many restaurants and all kinds of transportation. Amazing at these prices for a major American city.\n",
