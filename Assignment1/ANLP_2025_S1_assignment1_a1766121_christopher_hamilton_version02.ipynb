      "Text: My husband and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. We normally stay at very high class hotels but that night we wanted to try something new without spending a fortune. (St. Regis, Ritz, etc are our norms) We wanted the Tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel (unassuming front) The Bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away. While checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say Happy Anniversary. Being Starwood platinum, we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade. We gave 12,000 points which was the minimum. They told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view. Then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever! They gave us the top floor. They brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room. It was the best ever!! The room was simple but beautiful. The view was amazing! The bed was soooo comfortable and I slept like a baby. I can't say enough about the bathroom. It was sooo nice. I would give the bathroom a 5 star. I'm not kidding! For a sheraton, it was very impressive. I don't know why I haven't been to this hotel before. Now that I know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us, I will go back soon. We go into the city a lot and I will for sure go back!! Thank you so much Sheraton! You wowed us!!\n",

      "Text: For the past year and a half, my daughter has been fighting cancer. We have had to travel to both Dallas and Houston for treatment, and the Crowne Plaza has always been there to offer a clean, inexpensive, convienent, and hospitable place for us to stay. Our last stay was at the River Oaks Crowne Plaza in Houston, Texas, and as always, the hotel was there when we needed them. Everything from the help at the front desk to help finding a place to eat was taken care of. Mandy, the concierge, was extremely knowledgable concerning local restaurants, shuttles, and even a taxi with comfortable seats and a non smoking atmosphere to take my wife and daughter to the airport only 3 days out of major surgery. We will always seek out a Crowne Plaza to stay at when available, and will always recommend them to friends and family when needing a place to stay. The Crowne Plaza is one of the unsung heros in our fight to rid our daughter of cancer.\n",

      "Text: Great Value for a King, Queen, and Princesses. We stayed at the Pacific Terrace with our two daughters (3.5 and 8 months old) for five nights in early March. The hotel was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It looked even better in person than on the hotel website. Everyone was friendly. We really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our \"partial-oceanview.\" The room was roomy. I wish the beds weren't so high off the ground since I have two young children, but the rooms were beautiful. There was a big flat screen T.V. The sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready. There was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel. The included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, juice, coffee, water, and yogurt. The afternoon wine reception was very relaxing. We sipped our wine by the pool. The pool area was beautiful and comfortable. Our 3.5 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night! I enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby. We walked to dinner many nights. The hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots. We really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above. The area is difficult to pinpoint exactly. It is a 50s beach bungalow type location. There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk. That being said, we were never uncomfortable. Right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at $750,000!!! The hotel was really convenient to La Jolla and to Seaworld. We loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean. We paid $15 day to park in their garage under the hotel. They even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing.

Space, comfort, well equipped rooms, a choice of pools, an impressive spa and a well-equipped gym with a consistently high quality standard of service throughout. Details have been looked after and lessons learned from the sometimes antiseptic feel of the high-end chains. The food is excellent with the Addison worth a visit in itself. The golf course is fantastically maintained and tuition is hands-on and effective. An instant favourite\n",

Not the least expensive spot in town, but I defy you to find a hotel of this caliber that offers suites of this size at lower prices. You won't. Since the hotel is freshly renovated, every inch of the property is spotless & fresh. We had a London Suite on the 17th floor which was silent when the windows were closed. Our suite had a parlor which was separated from the bedroom by a small entryway & a very well-lit bathroom, which was enormous. The huge mirrors on the bathroom wall were separated by fabulous light panels that made makeup application a breeze. In addition, the shower area was ~9' x 4' with a \"rain shower\" type fixture on one end, and a \"shower massage\" fixture on the other. There was also a Euro hand-held fixture, so the bases were covered regarding your showering options. The bed offered super deluxe pillow-top comfort, and the pillows were fab. The linens were very high thread-count sateen. The ambiance is minimalist/elegant in the suites & throughout the hotel. Didn't try the restaurant/bar. Loved every moment that we were there & look forward to returning. Hopefully their discounted rate will continue forever.\n",

When checking in remember to asked for the bar key so you can store beverages in the refrigerator. Room 402, was the suite, large bathrooom, no closet space, nice room, fireplace, but the sofa bed was terrible. In addition, the heater did not work, so I had to order additional blankets to get warm...even received a slight cold upon return. Room 402 did have a view, they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night. Did not asked for a discount; they told me to contact Manager who was unable at the time each time I inquired. The Corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not (may be the government rate). The coffee in the morning was great; did not attend the wine party. Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great. If you book a room, asked for the courtyard view if possibe. Location is everything at this site; everything you need is right in the area. Pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance. Do you go the aquarium; not worth the price.\n",

Overall I was extremely happy with the newly branded Holiday Inn Express and the value we received for just under $130/nt incl tax. The hotel is 100% located parallel to the freeway so I requested a room facing away from the freeway and Jose was very happy to oblige when we checked in just after 8pm. In fact Jose was friendly, attentive and helpful....which is not the usual response when you check into a property so late in the day. We had rm #347 and you could not hear a peep from the freeway! The one complaint my husband had was that the airconditioner was very noisy. To make matters worse it kept turning itself on/off all night which was noisy and frustrating. We couldnt seem to figure out how to keep it constantly on...if management could somehow fix this I think it would certainly help. I would suggest bringing ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. We had a rental car from Enterprise and it was literally down the road so it was very convenient so early in the morning. The Holiday Inn Express also had a little convenience store in the lobby which was open 24 hours so you could easily grab some water or some snacks to tide you over. The renovation was really well done - new carpet, furniture, microwave, kettle, tv, duvet set etc...even the bathroom had been preened (still keeping in with some of the retro outfit though). All in all I was very happy with the Holiday Inn Express...\n",

We were in town for a school interview with our son, we arrived at the Hotel early before the check in time. The staff was so wonderful and accommodating that they checked us in and held our bags, we were so appreciative Courtney at the front desk was absolutely wonderful and just a lovely person. We told her why we were there and she was so excited for our son, she told hime not to be nervous that he would do great. We then asked her if there was a way to have our bags held while we were at the interview and she told us not to worry about anything that they would take care of everything. This was our son's first trip to New York and you made it such a wonderful trip. Our stay was a bit short but Tyler{son} loves NY. so we will be back before he goes back to school.

      "Text: This hotel has a lot of potential. Cosmetically it looked pretty good. Bathrooms were great but the rooms could use a better upgrade. When we checked in we asked for a king with a sofa bed. Was told they were completely sold out. She even checked with the manager and she said the same thing. We are platinum members so we are supposed to be abe to get upgraded rooms if available. We were fine with her answer so we got our key and went to our room. After a few hours the A/C unit in our room started making a horribly loud noise. We couldn't hear anything over it. Maintenance couldn't fix it so they moved us to a different room. Surprisingly, it was a king room with a sofa bed. Pretty sure that's what I asked for in the first place, but whatever. It was a corner room with views of the river and it was literally the most amazing view. That view was almost worth the troubles. Except at 2:00 am this A/C unit started making the very same noise. Really?? So irritating. There was no way we were dragging all of luggage to a different room in the middle of the night. I turned the A/C completely off and tried to sleep. Not the best when it's been 100 degrees outside all day. I called the manager the next morning and he refunded the points we used for the room I feel he could've done more than that but at that point we just wanted out of the hotel. When we were leaving our room I heard over the maintenance radio that someone else was also having problems with a noisy A/C unit. I'm thinking it's time to replace the A/C units.\n",

Milk arrived 30 minutes later, which we had to ask for. I spoke to the person at Lockwoods. She quickly vanished and was not seen again. When sandwiches arrived the waitress wondered where she would put them so my wife had to hold them while she got a small table to put beside her, so she could dish them out.

We had a corner 'family suite' in the front older part of the hotel which had plenty of room for us and all of our luggage. The smaller room held a double (or queen?) bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed. With the sofa away, we had a large lounge area with coffee table - perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of San Franciso.\n",

Nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food, including a Walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies (there was a fridge in the kids room). The Irish pub next door has a fantastic dinner buffet, and the bar around the corner has a champagne happy hour and live music (for Mum & Dad's time out).\n",

We easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us (yes 7) to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean BART train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus. More money to spend in the wonderful shops in Chinatown!\n",

We were not disappointed. Paying only a little above $200 per night, we got a very spacious suite - a corner one at that - and the experience was impressive in every aspect. The service was friendly, professional, and efficient. The valet parking (which cost us a mere $30 total) meant that our car was ready at the door when we wanted it, and upon arriving back at the hotel, we could just get out of the car and go back to our room. Very convenient. The decoration and styling of the hotel is not as \"gaudy\" and \"florid\" as some other high-end brands, but the look is very elegant, modern, and artistic no less. You might call it luxury without ostentation. The suite was most accomodating in every way, from the numerous spacious closets, to the heavenly comofortable bed, to the well-stocked refrigerator bar, and the wall finishings and all the furniture. Oh, and the bathroom - extremely impressive. It was tremendous, with two sinks, a comfortable bath, and a spacious shower. If I had to find anything to quibble about, I could say that the wireless internet should have been free rather than $10/day (though I was able to get a free signal from a nearby hotel....), and it would be nice if the bathroom would have a jacuzzi rather than a plain bathtub (though strictly speaking, it was actually a \"Jacuzzi\" brand bathtub, but anyway....). Can't speak for the bar/restaurant as we did not partake. Don't forget to bring cash to tip the valets, room service, and bellhops! All in all you can't go wrong with this hotel, certainly at the price we paid. Strongly recommended. We would easily stay there again.\n",

We stayed in a queen suite with a fold out couch. The room was beautiful, and the whole hotel was immaculate. I can't comment on service, since we didn't order any, but the location was great. It was within walking distance of the pier and many other Chicago attractions. There was also an awesome pizza place right next door. It's more of a business-type hotel, so I wouldn't recommend it to people who want to have entertainment at the hotel for their kids.\n",

Room: 1115 grand deluxe 2 queen beds, good size room and large bathroom with separate bath and shower and plentiful toiletries. Excellent maid service. On arrival we found the bath did not hold water, hair dryer did not work, shower head loose and electric socks loose on walls. But to be fair these matters were resolved within an hour of us contacting reception. We requested a room in a quiet position, and were given a room facing the staff floor entrance, which meant constant banging of door. Was disappointed that there was not drink making facilities in the room, considering the cost. We also found that the room was not well sound proofed. When our credit card was swiped on arrival, they put it on 'hold' so we were unable to use it in shops. Be aware and bring a second card. We also found it inconvenient that you had to take a lift from the ground floor which was excessively slow to the lobby/reception area. Compared to other hotels the number of floors are limited rooms up to the 18th floor only, next time we would try taller hotel more than likely Trump Towers due to its position and scale. Overall, found more bad points than good points.\n",

The hotel is right in the concourse and even has its own security personnel, so you can clear security without having to face the long lines elsewhere. The rooms are great with the super \"heavenly bed\" that Westin offers. The food is excellent and the meeting rooms are very good. The downside is that the staff (especially the front desk) tend to be brisk, and borderline rude. The other negative is that the hotel nickle and dimes the customer to death. $16 for internet access - a bit high, plus $2.50 for a local phone call! Ridiculous. As well, after a certain period of time you start getting dinged .10/minute, even after paying $2.50 for a local phone call. I ended up going downstairs and using a payphone rather than pay what they wanted for a local call. The hotel unfortunately is using their convenience to squeeze more money out of its patrons in the form of local calls and internet access, etc. While the food is good, it certainly is overpriced (as is everything at the hotel).\n",

It was great to walk out the hotel door and be right where you wanted to be. We found the hotel to be clean, and all the staff we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. We did have an issue with the television, we called the front desk and they sent an engineer to our room, and it was fixed within 15 minutes. The room service breakfast was very good. However, I can't say the same for the burger i had ordered. The burger was a very thick one, and that is okay, but it was way over cooked and very dry; it was a total waste of money. We were on the 11th floor across from the elevators. We could hear the subway, but could not feel it, it really didn't bother us all that much. Another reviewer mentioned that Little Italy was disappointing. Well, it is only two blocks these days as China Town is taking over. The two blocks of Little Italy are great, the only disappointment is that there is not more of it. The taxi ride, with tip, to Time Square ranged from $16-$20 if you are wondering. Well, we had a great time, loved the hotel, staff, and location. Yes, the room was a bit small, but I understand this is normal in NYC.

I'm estimating 300 to 400 people staying here for the jamboree on 10/19/12 & 10/20/12. May have been more or less but an estimated 400 people were expected for the jamboree. Some were probably fortunate to stay at other hotels!\n",
      "Let's start with checkin for these 300 people. Our first Jamboree activity started at 3:00 pm. Many people were told that hotel checkin would start at 1:00 pm. By 1:00 pm there were at least 40 people waiting at the registration desk ready to check-in. A little after 1:00, we were told that checkin would not be until 3:00. It was requested to speak with the manager. A man came out and I think he said he was the Assistant Manager but I could be mistaken. He told us that the rooms were not ready and checkin would not start until 3:00. MANY unhappy campers!! I suggested that since the checkin process takes a while, perhaps we could take care of that (you know - credit card, etc.) and pick up the room key later. Oh, no, that wouldn't work. Could we get key and not go to room until 3:00? No, couldn't do that. I guess he finally saw our \"mob mentality\" and, perhaps, fearing for his life, he relented and said ok, you can check in but if the room's not clean you'll have to wait. Ok, we agreed to that. Now - expecting this many people and that most would be checking in around the same time so that we didn't miss the first activity, wouldn't you think they'd have several people available for checkin?? Well, you'd be wrong!! There were 2 people checking us in. After about 30 minutes, 2 other ladies showed up to help. One of these was a young lady named Celine. Celine was wonderful. \n",
      "Ok, let me back up a little. We had 21 ladies in our group and when reservations were made months ago, we requested that we all be located on the same floor and that we have one hospitality suite. Well, they had us scattered on at least 3 different floors & maybe more. Celine took some of our names and somehow arranged that most of us were on the same floor; however, the hospitality suite on the second floor was not ready so in addition to being scattered everywhere, our hopitality suite ended up being on the 6th floor (no one ever asked for that floor!)\n",

I could go on and on.\n",

One elevator on Saturday, the doors just stayed open and it wouldn't move. Carpets were filthy and worn; walls and tiles, etc. were nasty looking. Ice machine on floor 2 (my floor) didn't work; finally found one vending machine with Pepsi in it that worked (don't remember which floor). OLD television set in my room so didn't even turn on. Someone said they turned theirs on but no reception! Geez!\n",

The room was simple (but did have a great flat screen and good size bathroom!) , squeaky clean, the staff professional and helpful, and we could walk just about everywhere. This location just above DuPont circle gave us walking or metro access to the sites. Starbucks is served in the hotel lobby/bistro, and there are an abundance of coffee spots, restaurants, etc. just down the hill. The pool is summer only, but there is a fitness center and convenient little coffee shop downstairs that is open day and evening. Great computers in lobby. Highly recommend if you are looking for a convenient, clean, bargain with easy access to the sites....and there was thay friendly staff too.

      "Let me give you a quick list of the things I loved: the room, bathroom, and shower were nice, clean, and very very roomy; I found the bed to be very comfy; there were a lot of good restaurants and 2 good grocery stores within walking distance; a fridge and a microwave I made good use of; every staff member I ran into was very polite and friendly; it was good to have free wifi and a flat screen tv that got HD channels.\n",
      "There were a few things that did not lessen my opinion of how awesome the hotel was, but could be a potential dealbreaker for others. You can really hear the people walk around and roll luggage on the floor above you pretty clearly. The nice big tvs in the rooms had a shelf near it that looked convenient if I had brought a video game console. However from what I could tell, there were only had composite video inputs and not the hdmi I would have preferred. Also, the hd channels on the tv weren't on the hotel provided channel listings, but were there way past of all the other sd channels and seemed to be a pretty random selection of what was there. The shower was designed to not need any sort of curtain or door, but it seemed to me that to make it work and not get water all over the bathroom the shower head was pointed towards a corner and was not adjustable at all. That made the very roomy shower seem kinda cramped as I had to huddle in the corner of the shower to stay in the water flow.\n",

Supposedly the steam radiator provides heat but it \"cycles\" on and off and no one seems to know whether it will cycle on during your stay (or even your lifetime) and it does get cold in Chicago during the winter.

When I called the front desk, they immediately upgraded my room to a lovely windowed suite. When I could not figure out how to work the shower, they sent engineering staff right away to help. All staff were very friendly and courteous, even the non-english speaking house keeper. The room had a sunrise to die for which was good because my course began at 7 AM. The conference also went very smoothly and the food for that was more than adequate. The restaurants in the hotel were very high quality.

The pool area is huge and easy to find a quiet place if that's your thing. Plenty of areas for families with kids too. Even the lazy river is cool.

One word about the hotel's location -- it's a little off the beaten path, but if you are reasonably fit you can easily walk from the hotel to Time Square in less than 10 minutes. The subway is also just three (long) crosstown blocks away. Cabs are everywhere; buses are just one block over. Over the years I have stayed in at least 25 NYC hotels.

You can't go wrong being literally next door to Grand Central and only 10-15 minutes away from all major attractions, not to mention the great food choices that won't break the bank found nearby on 3rd Ave. Try the Libretto Pizzeria on 3rd and you'll love the food as well as the homemade NY favorites- cannoli and tiramisu were the best I had! Just a side note. Anyhow, the hotel room itself was nothing special- room was very small but the bathroom I found designed for a little child and not for adults so this was the worst thing about the room. However, I knew going in that Manhattan hotels had tiny rooms so I wasn't expecting anything. Keep in mind that there is no way more than two people could be comfortable in one room so get two rooms if you are three or more in number. Hotel staff were friendly and attentive to all my questions and issues with the room. TV reception is horrible and I complained about it but was told nothing can be done- I assumed all the tall buildings cause reception problems so it didnt bother me much- was out all day anyways. I didn't appreciate all the nickel and diming they did with the costly WiFi charges, charges for using the hotel phone for toll free and even local charges, or the final surprising charge that I'd never encountered before which was for luggage storage upon check out. They charge per piece of luggage which I didn't appreciate. But I figured that this is NY so was expecting to be ripped off here and there. Overall, this was an excellent first time visit to NYC and we had a great time. Can't wait to go back again and will definitely stay at the Hyatt each time I visit because again, it's location can't be beat by any other major NYC hotel in the area.

The front desk staff changed my check out time at no charge in order to accommodate my schedule. The room came with a small fridge and microwave, fabulous! Given the heat and humidity this was a welcome amenity! There was plenty of space in the room, tons of pillows, and the beds were comfortable. I would have no problem staying here again. So what are those areas needing upgrades? As with most older hotels the elevators can be slow and crowded when the place is full. The elevator lobbies on each floor is very narrow. There really is no room to accommodate people with luggage waiting to get on and people coming off the elevator with luggage. I was on the fifth floor so I always took the stairs to go down and only used the elevator to go up. The stairs are definitely not pretty!!!!

Whoever wiped half the table did not wring out the rag very well. Not to mention they should not be doing this in the first place. Then the coffee mugs were set on the table upside down so the lip you drink from is sitting in the wet dirty solution. Needless to say I moved to the dry side of the table. Wait, what? Half the table was wet and half dry? I can only guess that only the side someone else sat was cleaned. I asked for just two eggs, once over, and toast. Well I got that plus fried potatoes, which I didn't want, nor did I eat. And I was of course charged an arm and a leg for it! She did not hear me, maybe it was my Midwestern accent! lol.

We had 5 in our large room with 4 double beds and a pull-out sofa. The bath was small and the tub would not drain properly. However, the staff quickly provided maintenance to unstop it every time. Given the location and the price, I would stay there again, even with the problems. The staff were so nice, and since we were travelling on foot or by Metro, the location was great! I didn't eat at Harry's, but the Blue Plate Diner offered a great breakfast buffet for those that enjoy that meal. You'll enjoy the location and the price if you're not looking for luxury and you want a good deal.\n",

We arrived in Phoenix rather late and had a very early flight on the return, so wanted to stay near the airport on either end of the trip. We selected the Fairfield because of its proximity to the airport, the complimentary shuttle and, of course(!), Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The hotel staff were all very nice (Jake and Jenny at the front desk, and Mark and Tim driving the shuttle). The room and the property were clean, the bed was very comfortable, and overall it was very quiet. However, if you're looking for a lively atmosphere, then Tempe, home of Arizona State University, is only 3 miles away. There were also plenty of restaurants there, as well. Unfortunately, if you don't have a car (as we didn't at the end of our trip since we'd turned it back in), your choices are limited, which could be a negative. However, the shuttle drivers, even though it's not advertised and I doubt you could demand this service, were kind enough to drive us the three miles, which worked out great. In short, for a clean, quiet and convenient place that's close to Sky Harbor International, I would recommend this hotel.\n",

There are no deadlocks on the doors to prevent little ones from exiting the room. Since the two sleeping areas are on opposite ends of the suite, separated by a bathroom and if parents are in sound sleep from a day of exploring, they might not hear if an early riser child should get inquisitive and head out! Since our 5 year old is on the Sprectrum, this created some anxiety about sleeping arrangements. The resort (hotel) is outstanding but this glitch could be fixed easily and without a lot of cost.\n",

      "The room wasn't large but was fine for the four of us. The bathroom is updated with marble and a double shower which was great. One complaint is that Westin tries to save money on amenities by only providing the basics (shampoo, conditioner, soap).

We also had an issue with the feather and down bedding (allergies) but they quickly fixed that for us.\n",

      "Text: We traveled to Boston for vacation this year. As we always do when we travel, we end up parking our car at one of the airport parking lots. However, this year we learned of a different way of doing it from a neighbor. We stayed the night before at the Renaissance Hotel on Airport Blvd. and did the Park and Fly. You stay at least one night at the hotel and you get 7 days of covered parking for free. It is then $11.00 a day after that. It's a beautiful hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We also ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was awesome. Our waiter, Sergio, was very professional and a great representative and spokesperson for the hotel. When it comes to traveling, I believe this might be one of the best deals in town.\n",

In our case we used the adjacent Italian restaurant-if you are staying at the Tuscan Inn you get 10% off your bill.\n",

      "Text: This is not a gripe but I have 4 issues with regards to my stay. First I booked thru Hotwire and I got a ridiculously low rate which is really great for me but for the first time i felt like a second class guest here. Why? First, the room they gave us was nice at first glance but upon closer scrutiny there were minor problems like the shower head was defective, the toilet had a leak, and the knob in one of the lampshades was missing. Second the location was right in front of the tracks so if you are a light sleeper then better bring some earplugs. Third we stayed for 6 days and upon checking in I requested for a fridge since I had my family with me. They told me that they will bring it to my room as soon as it becomes available. It never came although the rooms next to us received theirs even if I came earlier. I know what I am talking about because I saw the refrigerators out side the rooms near us. Lastly there were 3 occassions that I had to call the cleaning ladies attention with regards to our daily supply of toiletries which she forgot. I have been using Hotwire for the past couple of years and never has this happened to me. I was always treated as if I was a regular paying guest. Anyway as I've said, this is not a complaint just an observation. If someone asks me if I would like to stay again at the Hilton Gaslamp I would definitely say yes. The location is fantastic, the front desk staff were friendly, and the ambiance was terrific. I've stayed in 4-5 stars hotel in San Diego since 2003 and I have to admit this is the best. The issues I raised did not really bother us for we were always out enjoying San Diego. Lastly, will I still patronize Hotwire? You bet I will. I hope this becomes a wake up call for both Hotwire and the Hilton.\n",

They helped us on a number of occasions with answers to such questions as \"what bus do I get to go to Battery Park and where do I get it\" to helping with our online checkin and obtaining our boarding passes. The location of the Hotel is one of its biggest assets. Right opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden on 7th Ave, it is only a couple of blocks to most of the sites...Macy's, Empire State Building, Times Square and Broadway. There are plenty of fast food establishments around Penn Station but we found a great cafe down 31st street (Cafe R) which had salads and freshly cooked Asian food.

Times Square is an easy walk as well as 5th Avenue and FAO Schwartz. \n",

The TV was tiny, but nobody goes to NY to watch TV. The standard rooms consist of a bed and a tiny bathroom, but they were more than adequate for the two of us. They made good use of the small space with hooks and shelves in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathrooms – in pictures, the pane of glass in the shower I thought was a little revealing with no privacy, but they do actually have a curtain on each side of the glass which was a relief.\n",

Jatin took control for us and tried to contact Expedia on our behalf to see what alternative arrangements could be made. This is when things got difficult as the silence from expedia was deafening. Jatin explained that our only option was to stay that night and if the power did not come on then he would look at other options for us. Thankfully the power came on at 5am and we were good to go. Thereafter we could not have been in a better hotel, location and with excellent staff all round it ended up a fantastic holiday.

We had been advised by a friend to ask about the top floors; since we were there with a convention, we had a convention rate that my business would pay. It turned out that upgrading the rooms was only $40 more a night, and the view and amenities were really nice. It's probably more expensive to be on the very top floor, but since they were out of the medium upgrade rooms, they went ahead and put us up there at no extra charge--those rooms included breakfast anywhere in the hotel, use of the spa and a lounge with internet access, fresh flowers in the room, and a killer view. We were delighted.\n",

      "Text: I normally don't bother with reviews but this stay I felt needed one. I always check out trip advisor reviews before booking with a hotel and they have never steered me wrong. However, this hotel was a huge disappointment. I usually take the bad reviews with a grain of salt if there are numerous good reviews. Well, I should have listened to the bad this time. First off, all staff that I encountered (except for a young lady that had only been there 4 months) were rude. We booked through expedia which advertised \"free shuttle, free continental breakfast\" at a special rate (which was $3 less than the sign outside the hotel when we arrived). We were given a room on the ground floor on a saturday night at about 8pm. We were surprised at the amount of people out in the halls and outside but we figured it would calm down. No such luck...folks were making all kinds of noise all throughout the night. There were a lot of young couples making out in the parking lot and with the mirror over our bed and the extremely small room, it made me wonder if there aren't a lot of \"hourly\" stays here. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and with all the noise, we were not able to sleep one wink. the small uncomfortable room with the hard bed did look clean but there was something splattered all over the mirror headboard (like soda or food or something) that made me wonder if they really cleaned the rooms ever. We were only staying for one night so we could leave the next morning for a flight to disney world. When we checked in we told the girl that we had requested the shuttle service for 7am. She said ok and wrote our names on some sort of list- not a problem. Also asked what we would have to do to get the shuttle back to the hotel and she replied- just call the hotel and we'll take care of it. Ok. Well, the next morning no one was at the front desk...we later found out he was the one setting up breakfast. When I asked him about the shuttle, he did come out and call the driver to wake him up. I also asked him if we just called them or how the process worked to get picked up. He said to just call. He was very short with everyone he spoke to. He was very strange (can't describe him) Anyway, there were 5 of us already out there waiting for him (he was supposed to be out there at 7am). The driver finally showed up at 7:30 to give us a ride (pretty darn tired looking). He must have also not gotten any rest from all the partying going on in the halls the night before. Anyway, we got the ride to the airport and there were no lines so no problems getting to our 9:30 flight on time. The real problem was when we returned. I called the hotel to get the shuttle back to where my van was parked. All of a sudden they have no record of me even staying there. Then the lady on the phone finally finds it and says \"oh, you booked through expedia so you shouldn't have been allowed to park and shuttle without upgrading to our price\" She also called my price \"extremely discounted\" even though it was only $3 less than the advertised price on their signage and it was I am pretty sure the crappiest room they had available. After hearing I might have to pay double what I paid to get back to my van which was already parked at the hotel, you can imagine I was pretty irrate. So I did mention to her that I got a discounted rate for a crappy room. She insisted that I had to pay the fee that the 2 employees before should have mentioned to me and made me pay before I left my van there. She asked that I pay that fee when I got back to the hotel and since I finally agreed, she did go ahead and have the shuttle man pick me up since he was already there picking up another couple. But she was pretty rude about it. Also, if you have small children you should know that the shuttle is more of a small minivan. I didn't think to bring a car seat for my two year old son bc I didn' know this. Next time I will ask the hotel what kind of shuttle. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend staying here at all but if you still decide to...just know that you will probably pay way more money than advertised. I watched a couple check in that morning and the cost ended up being $70 without any kind of park and ride service. The sign outside advertised $49.99 but with taxes and fees the front desk guy told them it was $70. Anyway, this review may not sound too bad to some and I guess I should have known better than to try to save a little money. However, after these reviews I felt like it would be a good place to stay for one night. Boy was I wrong. Nothing was as advertised and how can it be a good place for one night when everyone is making noise all night? No consideration at all. It was a horrible way to start our vacation...I should have just waken up at my house at 3am and driven 3 hrs to the aiport myself...it would have been better than paying for this hotel and not even getting to sleep there. Just not good experiences...I just want to save others from having similar experiences. Oh and the lady that made me pay extra was dissing expedia like crazy and I have always booked through them with no problems whatsoever. On the positive side, since we were standing in the lobby for 30 minutes waiting for the driver of the shuttle bus...I did manage to get a bagel to eat and get some fruit loops and juice for my son. The breakfast didn't start until 7 (a little after) though on the weekends. I'm wondering if those folks with good reviews stayed during the weekday and if that makes a difference. Maybe an upper level larger room, I don't know. But I will say that when we got there I kind of felt like the lady who wrote she didn't feel safe in this hotel. It was just the people hanging out in the hallway and the sketchy people walking up and down the road around the hotels. I kinda wondered if my van would be safe but the front desk lady just said not to leave anything valuable in it and that they hadn't had to call the cops for any incidents in about 4 months....\n",

She also gave us some cocktail drink coupons for the lounge that came in handy for us . Thank you all for you hospitalty .\n",

The location is in the heart of Center City with restauarants, theaters and historic sights all within walking distance. Philly is a great city to explore on foot and the hotel is perfectly central to any place one would want to get to. The lobby was lovely and the front dest was very pleasant. When a charge for the hotel bar was erroneously put on my room tab, they immediately took care of it. The room was spacious and clean, and even the maids were very friendly. Great weekend in Philly\n",

I booked four nights at Le Meridien through hotels.com but could not make it to my first night due to a family emergency. My husband called to inform the hotel and make sure I would have a room when I arrived the next morning. After sleeping for a couple hours in the emergency room, I left town to drive to Dallas at 3:30AM so I could make it to the hotel to shower and change into my suit and attend my 8:30AM business meeting. Needless to say, it was a harrowing night.\n",
      "When I arrived, the hotel had sold my room, cancelled my reservation for all four nights that I had already PREPAID for, and was completely sold out. I was told that my reservation was not guaranteed because it was made through a third party booking company. I was told I could change in the lobby restroom and rebook my room for the next three nights and check in later in the afternoon. Although I told them I was in a time crunch due to my 8:30AM meeting, it still took the staff over half and hour to rebook my room for the remaining three nights. I was frustrated and so tired when I finally left for my meeting.\n",
      "I relunctantly returned to the hotel after I finally finished with my long day (after all, I had already paid for the rooms and was too exhausted to fight with hotels.com for a refund) and explained to the manager what happened. She apologized, explained what her staff should have told me--that they had had a serious plumbing incident the night before which greatly affected their booking schedule, refunded my first night's room charge, and upgraded me to a giant corner suite. She really went above beyond to make me feel welcome at this hotel (and even offered to send up some hot tea).\n",

We had a premier suite that was large and perfect for us. The living room was a perfect place to put our daughter in her\n",

Were able to close the french doors to our bedroom and watch a little tv without disturbing her. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated. Our room was in hues of blue and chocolate brown. The bathroom was restored, but still had beautiful old white marble and a seperate area to put on your makeup with good lighting. There is also a seperate wet bar area off of the living room that was a great space to keep our daughter supplies, food and bottles. The bed was very comfortable and my husband really enjoyed the wireless internet. The Eliot is also in a fabulous location and just a short walk to so many wonderful restaurants and shops. We were sad that we were only staying one night, but are delighted to have found a favorite hotel in Boston.\n",

There are softdrink and ice dispensers on each floor though so that was good. Pool was lovely and warm but as it was quite cool when we were there we didn't use it.

Just a great time was had by all. I will definitely stay here again\n",

      "Title: “Home base for a dream vacation”\n",
      "Text: We booked our New York vacation through Air MIles and after considering a couple of options decided on The New Yorker. We were not disappointed. This is a great hotel with small but comfortable rooms and great security. For $10 a night we upgraded to a room-with-a-view and it was worth every penny. We were in a corner room and out of one window had a view of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State building a few blocks away and Penn Station and Madison Square Garden just below. Out of the other window we had a partial view of the Hudson River and all the buildings north of the hotel. It seems like a small thing but there's something magical about being able to look out over the city at night. The lighting on the Empire State Building changes from time to time. It was green for St. Patrick's Day. The great thing about The New Yorker is that its within walking distance of many local attractions - Times Square, Broadway, St. Patrick's Cathedral, The Rockefeller Centre, MoMA, 5th Avenue. If you're ambitious you can even walk to the 9-11 Memorial (about 2 miles) and Central Park. There are many excellent restaurants in the area and it's an easy walk to local favourites like Grimaldi Pizza and Brooklyn Bagels. The Chinese restaurant just a block away, Chef Yu, was excellent. For a great lunch take the subway down to 369 Broome Street for a sub sandwich at Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich. One of the best meals all week was the Thai dinner we ate at Bangkok House, 360 West 46th, just a healthy walk from the hotel. The bed in our room was extremely comfortable and after walking miles every day we slept well. The housekeeping service was good - almost too good - as sheets and towels were changed even when they didn't need to be. The smallness of the room wasn't a factor most of the time, but the absence of a second chair meant that one of us had to sit on the bed while watching television (rare) or using the hotel's free internet. The free internet tended to be a little slow but we decided against the upgrade to premium internet for around $10 per day. The souvenir shop in the basement of the hotel was well stocked and reasonably priced. If you're considering taking a double-decker bus tour the consensus seemed to be that the Gray Line is more reliable than the City Sights competitor. We had pre-booked with City Sights and overall it was pretty good. However, one afternoon on the Uptown Tour, we hopped off at the Metropolitan Museum and never did hop back on. Every bus that came by was full with others who had hopped back on. There were about ten very tired and frustrated people still waiting when we decided to take a cab back to our hotel. Anyway, it was a fabulous week and having a great, comfortable hotel like The New Yorker as our home base had a lot to do with making this the vacation of a lifetime.\n",

The location was perfect for what we wanted to see and do, our nicely decorated rooms were spacious, and the shower stall in our modern bathroom was big enough for a mom to wash five kiddies at the same time. We got a newspaper outside our door and coffee was served in the lobby each morning. There was free WiFi in the lobby as well. However, most important to us was the genial hotel staff who offered service with a smile each and every time we requested it. When Journeywoman realized she had left her iphone power cord at home the assistant manager happily shared his with her and saved the day. Plus there were two female conscierge desks in the lobby and those girls knew their stuff. This hotel definitely earned a JW Gold Star rating from us.

Gorgeous quiet and clean corner room with plenty of views. The staff service was outstanding, from checkin to departure. High notes for housekeeping and room service. We tried the restaurant several times, and the food and service were outstanding - try the smoked salmon flatbread for a breakfast change (the buffet is great, too). Location cannot be beaten. The only thing to improve: Wireless internet connection on floor 24 war bad to nonexistent, we were never able to connect to the Omni router (extremly weak signal) and used our wireless broadband card instead without any problems. vWe`ll be back soon!

This time we were given a large suite of two room size and were then informed that there was no water on our floor due to maintenance. (actually we were told it was the whole of midtown without water, even though the water was working elsewhere in the hotel)I must say we were offered compensation for no water, a voucher for their own spa at a value that meant you had to spend more, unreal.\n",

Had I had to pay for that meal there I would have been very angry at the state of the food for the cost.\n",

We downgraded to a Double Double room and the porters transferred our luggage whilst we were out sight seeing, so all we needed to do was check out of one room and into the other.

      "The check-in was done by a friendly and attentive receptionist. Our room was available straight away. The check-in desk is on the first floor but there are lifts and these were working great and fast during the whole week.

The next morning, I found a big bowl with a cute goldfish (it is fed and cleaned by the staff).\n",
      "The room was a little bit on the small size but considering it is New York City it is reasonable (I have been in smaller rooms). It is elegantly decorated: sleek & modern with a retro feel to it (check the towel rack & sink in the bathroom, very Art Deco). There was a small walk-in closet (with mirrors, it reminded me of the Orient Express) and a sort of tall boy so there was plenty of room to put all our clothes and hide our suitcases in the \"closet\". \n",
      "The bed was not big but it was comfortable. I always find beds too small as I have a king size bed at home, it is hard to go smaller! There was an ipod alarm clock (it charged my ipod nano), a flat tv screen, a dvd player, a phone and an iron/ironing board. The bathroom was small as well but there was a decent bath/shower and space to put your toiletries.\n",

It's walking distance or a quick drive to some trendy bars, and about a 10 minute drive from the arts district in NoDa for some restaurants and live music at night. The rooms are gorgeously decorated and extremely clean. I stayed in a studio with my sister, and it had a double bed, pull-out couch, recliner, desk, dining table, refrigerator, kitchen and stove, vanity and of course a toilet and bath. And a flat-screen television and high-speed internet access (a cord, not wireless).\n",

The complimentary breakfast is pretty awesome, with everything from your typical collection of cereals, bagels and donuts to a waffle station, scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, coffee, tea, juice, muffins, yogurt parfait, you name it. They also have a full bar available for evening socialization. The staff is also pretty friendly.\n",

The lobby is small, there isn't alot of glitz and glam, but then again for the price you can't beat the location.\n",
      "The location as been said is between 6th Ave and 7th Ave just below Canal St. We were originally worried about the Holland Tunnel traffic, but it wasn't that bad until Saturday (const. in the tunnel). Most other days it was typical NYC. The location is so close to the SoHo shopping/restaurants and not to mention the trendy scene in Tribeca. If your not familar with the area, its not like Midtown/Times Square at all, there aren't throngs of people, there aren't big bus tours, its just geniune NYC. We were able to walk to the WTC Site; the Brooklyn Bridge and Greenwich Village all within 15 mins.\n",
      "As far as taking a cab to the hotel, that can be tricky, don't say its on York St (York St. is a one block long alley and no-one will know wher that is). Instead say its on 6th Ave between Walker and Canal in Tribeca. As you come up 6th Ave its on the left one block before Canal. Look for the red restaurant awnings that say Bar Artisenal.\n",
      "As for the hotel, when we checked in we were informed that no King size beds were available, they instead offerred us a room with a jacuzzi tub. Now that was an unexpected surprise and came in handy at the end of long days hiking around the city. The tub was huge, allowing two people to fit very comforatbly. The double bed rooms had full size beds (not queen) which was a bit cozy, but the room itself had plenty of space. The beds were comfortable and they were the air-adjustable variety so you could adjust the firmness. It was very clean throughout. There was a mini fridge and microwave as well as a coffee maker in the room. They have full Comcast digitial/HD cable TV, including HBO and HBO On Demand, nice for a chain hotel.\n",
      "There is no pool, so don't be mis-led by the website. There also aren't safe's in the room. There are plenty of cabs going uptown on 6th Ave and you'll never have a problem getting one. There is a Dunkin Donuts across the street (when you need a DD-fix in the morning).\n",

Nevertheless i decided to go ahead and book it for 4 nights.\n",

The lifts were ok, i don't feel we waited exceptionally long for one to arrive. The corridors are clean, neat and tidy. We were on floor 10 in an executive room which i believe is the same as a standard room just slightly bigger. \n",
      "No great view but i wasn't there to sit and look out of the window, there was a desk which i used as a dressing table, not a massive amount of space to put things in the bathroom but seriously we were there for 4 nights so there was enough room for what we needed. Just a shower, no bath but that was hot and good pressure.\n",
      "A safe in the wardrobe and about 20 hangers for the two of us, there were three drawers either side of the massive comfortable bed which again for 4 nights was perfectly adaquate for what we needed.\n",
      "The TV was large and had the usual channels, we managed to watch a film on ABC or something like that and you can pay extra for new films etc if you wanted too (not too sure how much they are). The mini bar is motion sensitive and that includes the things on top so i would recommend not touching any of it.\n",

      "If you turn right out of the hotel and walk two blocks you are on fifth ave, this is about a 3 - 4 minute stroll away. Central park is just passed Tiffany's and takes about a 15-20 minute stroll, empire state is about 10 -15 minute stroll with a pass by Macy's.\n",

To give you an idea i stay in 5 star hotels generally but in a city a 4 star as you don't spend any time there, we were out by 9am and not back until 12am or a quick pop i for shower and change.

For those with access to it the Concierge Lounge was excellent! A perfect place to unwind and get some work done with free refreshments and scrumptious appetizers. The location is perfect! Close to everything! The property is clean and warm and very cheerful. Every staff member that I encountered was authentically concerned about our comfort and enjoyment. They really want to make sure your experience is memorable. We took advantage of ordering some room service and were completely satisfied. The food arrived hot and tasty! In under 20 minutes!!! The hotel was immaculate and felt very cozy. The beds were a dream! (pun intended) The rooms were clean as a whistle and the bathroom was luxurious! \n",

The hotel is older but seemed to be kept up pretty well. Several nicks and scratches on the furniture but nothing terrible. The bathrooms were older but kept clean and updated the best that they could without a complete overhaul. Ask for a balcany room overlooking the pool for the best experience. If you don't ask, you probably won't get. Checked in early, around 12:30PM with no problem. On Saturday evening they set up a large movie screen by the pool and showed the movie \"Scooby Doo\". Several families were down at the pool sitting in lounge chairs enjoying the movie. It was kinda neat. The only thing is, is that if your room overlooked the pool, you could hear the movie with the sliding door open. But it was shown early enough in the evening that it wasn't an annoyance. The hotel circle area has many mid-range hotels to choose from and this one is pretty good size and probably my favorite right now. The only sad thing about the area is that, with all the hotels, there are few in any restaurants. I guess the hotels want you to eat at their hotels but haven't been lucky enough to eat at a good one there. All in all, not bad.\n",

All in all this hotel is a great value. Oh, and free beer and full alcohol bar each evening in the lobby for the managers reception. Parking is very expensive, and you should really just not bring your car here anyway. If you must park, the garage across the street is $10 cheaper per day.\n",

The staff from the spa did not know my name, but when I was in the lobby the receptionist came to me and said that I left my bracelet in the spa. So they could describe me and reception did know who I was. The spa reception excused because they did not know my name. I said that I liked the service a lot as they knew me. All the staff know you immediately. For example when we had breakfast on our second day the lady in the restaurant knew what we ordered the day before. Another lady in the restaurant (she served lunch the former day) knew us and came to us for a small talk. This is service we appreciate and like. \n",

Partly it was my fault as I gave two names, partly the concierge could contact me and asked which restaurant I was more interested for. The food in the other restaurant was good, but I expected another restaurant.\n",

Also a not to far to walk to Times Square. or many other attractions. Was nice to walk by Byrant Park looked so relaxing. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was very nice we changed our choice of room and was able to obtain one as soon as we arrived at 9:30 a.m. It ended up being a wheel chair accessable room which was fine we had a view of the ESB. The only down side is there were large fans on the roof of the building next door so would not want to open the window. But we did not want it open anyways. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The only comment I would say against the room is it was way too cold but they did come and fix that for us. The breakfast buffet was very nice way to start the day and ended up being the only meal of the day we did have everyday. \n",

We made our reservation a few weeks prior and got a reasonable rate. The Hotel is close to Times Square, but we decided to brave it and drive in.

She was very pleasant, suggesting that if we were driving to leave early- not something I would expect from a NYC \"boutique\" hotel. She even offered directions from New Jersey by train if we decided against taking the car! I must admit, this was a nice gesture. We arrived at City Club and were greeted by the bellman at the curb. The check in was quick and the staff offered assistance with dinner reservations and some suggestions on what was going on around town. We had already had made reservations, so declined their assistance. before we knew it we were upstairs in our room- which was wonderfully appointed, clean, and comfortable in size. The water pressure in the shower was amazing- the beds very comfortable and the service impressive. I felt like I was part of the family right away! Though our dinner reservations were not the best choice for us (maybe we should've taken the offer for help at check-in) our stay at City Club was great!

      "Text: This hotel is very conveniently located near Metro (Farrugot Station) only half a block! So it was very easy to hop on the train and be in all Museums in minutes! My husband and I spent a whole week at Room 776 (where Franklin D. Roosevelt stayed in 1933! -piece of history too ! Room was very nice and clean and the bathroom updated neatly and also super clean too. If you are picky about cleanness, this is a nice hotel for you. I particularly enjoy all Courtyard and Marriott’s new white comfortable beds to rest every day. The only thing about our room was the layout was set up with the TV on the side of the bed, but you may request TV to be in front of bed. We wanted to keep our historic room and did not care much about TV, you really won’t have much time with everything there is to do there in DC including sightings. Just make sure you don't get a room overlooking the back alley if you prefer a nicer view - Just ask and you’ll shall be served! On the brightest side, there are lots of restaurants nearby, California Pizza for Italian, Morton's for a very special and romantic dinner (expensive to impress your partner =) but avoid Bertucci’s (not so good Italian food). As for breakfast, we recommend walking to Luna or for a fast thing just go to any Au Bon Pain -delicious!!! There is a CV Pharmacy right on the block if you need your Epson salts. Also, there are banks, apparel stores, boutiques, etc… We have stayed several times in DC and in Silver Springs (we recommend the Courtyard Downtown Silver Springs if you want to be far from the city life). Overall, we would definitely consider the Mayflower Renaissance Hotel again for our next visit!\n",

The party scene is pretty hopping on weekends too.\n",

My friend got two free drinks of his choice, which he shared the deal with his GF! It can get loud, but anyone should be smart enough to know the theme ussually goes hand in hand with the atmosphere, it is called \"Hard Rock\" afterall. Only difference is, this isn't abunch of punks fighting the system and it's customers, or out-of-the-loop idiots giving different answers from everyone else. The staff treats you like rockstars, and seems to fit the part themselves, all the while being able to direct you to where you want to go, and the best of all the options after presenting them to you!\n",

It the grand scheme, most of the gas-lamp area isn't for tight wallet types, but this place does play a good hand at entertaining all.\n",

      "Text: I would agree with most of the comments here: nice brand new hotel, very nice rooms/decor, great location, staff at check in very friendly and welcoming. My problem occurred after checking out when I went to pick up my car at the recommended lot. Despite my reservation confirmation, which indicated a reduced parking fee of $30, and the website which says parking is $30, the garage charged me $40. They said my car was \"over-sized\". I went back to the hotel to question it and Alex at the desk said \"we have no control over what the garage does\". Although I might disagree with that notion, I did not argue, just asked that a manager call me the next day. It took a call to Holiday Inn Guest relations 2 days later before I received a call from the hotel management. I explained the situation, and received the same response that Alex gave: “we have no control over what the garage does\"; in addition, I was told that \"you would pay much more if we didn't negotiate a discounted rate\". No apology for any misunderstanding, no apology for the website being inaccurate. \n",
      "Honestly, not looking for $10, not looking for anything, but confirmation that the garage was not gouging, or acknowledgement that the hotel information should be more accurate. I simply said that the website and confirmation should be accurate; if you charge more for over size vehicles, just have the website say it. The manager did not say \"we'll address that\", he said \"we'll look into it\" \n",
      "On Sunday upon check out, I didn't know if the garage was ripping me off for $10; the good news is, they were not. The bad news is, as a well located hotel in NYC, I was left with the feeling that this hotel doesn't care about loyal Holiday Inn guests (I am a Gold Priority Club member).\n",

First of all, there is breakfast every morning. Not granola, no no, you get hot courses, you get oatmeal, you get eggs, you get sausage, you get waffles, it's great! Then, Mon - Thurs, you get a cocktail hour of beer and wine and snacks, and mini-dinner in case you don't want to go out. But way more better than all of that is, dumb me, I forgot stuff in the room, and I called, and it was there, they found it, and they sent it to me! The staff is great, so helpful, and so un-uptight! Oh, and be sure to note that they have a shopping service, and it is free! All you pay for is the product you want. They leave the receipts on the table and the stuff in your fridge. If I was running a hotel business this is the way I would run it. I'd really like to hide this place so that I can stay there next year, but people that travel to Denver a lot should really take note!

The restaurant was nice but way overpriced for this everyday traveler ($2.50 for just a cup of coffee). The only thing this hotel has is a good location. However, within two blocks is the Adam's Mark Hotel. For about the same price, you can stay at this first class hotel instead of the run down Omni. Like I said, my past experiences with Omni have been superb... this hotel just doesn't live up to the Omni name.\n",

      "Pros: (1) Location -- We had never been to Boston and wanted a central location to explore the city with kids. There is no better location than this. Just a few dozen feet from the Old State House and the subway station that is located underneath. From that station we could go anywhere we needed to go with minimal hassles and delay. We were able to conveniently walk the Freedom Trail and take meals at Fanuil Hall which is just a block away. (2) Service -- The staff went out of its way to welcome us with young children. Disregard what you may have read elsewhere all comments about this being a kid unfriendly place. The staff was among the most friendly we have encountered anywhere in the world. (3) Style -- Ultra hip and super-contemporary. Not something we usually go for, but it was a great change fo pace. Pretty neat. (4) Immaculate.

Great potential, a lot of great music history but it is all going to get lost in the crime. We stayed at the Hampton Inn there on Peabody, around the corner from Beale st. Lesson learned, many say why get a room that is expensive, all you do is sleep there. The room can make or break the vacation. It was very noisy, some of it seemed under construction. Recommend you spend a few extra and stay at the Peabody Hotel beautiful place we had dinner there 2 nights. Visited Grace land. Very nice, but growing up with Elvis also very sad.

      "When I made the reservation, was offered a \"potential\" upgrade. You could choose from several that were offered on line. No guarantee, you find out at check-in or the day before if you call. You can also decline prior to check-in. Neat concept. Got a corner room upgrade for $9 - well worth it with four large windows. Great views, but a little noisy on the street side. Room nicely equipped - even had toothpaste and upscale bath toiletries.\n",
      "At check-in was told I had an automatic 2 pm check-out, which would work very well for me. Gave me a chance to go upstairs and change after the meeting and freshen up before starting to drive home 2+ hours. Well - not really... headed up to my room at 11:30 to use the restroom and my key would not work. Thought I had the wrong room... but another guest answered. Even though I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" insert in the key slot - the maids must have entered the room without consulting the late check-out list, saw the room was empty, reported it vacated, and cleaned it in record time. Glad I wasn't in the shower.... Really - there wasn't that long between my trips to the room to accomplish all that plus get another person check-in to the room... wow... When I told the front desk, they apologized and offered me another room. I declined the new room - thought it was a waste, but the whole thing irritated me. \n",
      "The other quirk is the the statement. Upon check-in - they ask if you would like your final bill emailed to you. This was a new to me. So, if you say yes, you do not get a bill under the door (not sure if they do this at all anyway), It has been more that 24 hours and I still do not have an invoice - which I need to file my expenses. I had to call - they instruct you to go on-line and through a series of \"clicks\" request a copy of your statement - says it can take up to 48 hours. Normally, I would not leave without a bill. I guess that was my fault for not getting that when I exited the hotel - was too POed about the room thing.\n",

They only had one person bartending and waitressing in the afternoon. No fault to this lonely employee who was trying to serve everyone to the best of their ability, but was not able to provide prompt service. Aside from the service, there was mold growing on the bathtub tiles. I was interested to see if they would clean it the next day (which they did not). The maid service also knocked on the door and asked if we we \"needed anything\". I thought daily cleaning was the norm for Marriott and it was not necessary to request this service. The computer area for business and customer use was at the junction of two hallways with alot of noise and traffic.

The staff was more than accomodating in helping me arrange a semi-private dinner at the restaurant on the property. I was very impressed with all of their efforts. The hotel is downtown - so it's very close and within walking distance to the Moscone Convention center and many other attractions and shopping areas. My one and only issue is that there is no free internet access (about $15 per day).

Our room was really nice. We stayed there three years ago, and I could tell that our room had been updated since then. I think the furniture was the same, but it appeared to have new carpet and the bathroom vanity area appeared newer. It was very clean too. Wore white socks around the room the first night and couldn't see anything on the bottoms. The tub/toilet area of the bathroom is not fancy. Just a simple tub and toilet. If you are expecting glass shower surrounds and seperate tub and shower area, you might want to look elsewhere. Our room was on the ground floor of a two-storied building and was SUPER quiet. We could only hear our neighbors when they were coming in their door from the outside. We could hear our upstairs neighbors walking around occassionally, but overall...probably one of the quietest we have ever stayed in. Room was a great size for our family of 5. Our littlest slept on a toddler cot we brought from home. We requested a microwave and with that and the refrigerator, we were able to make several light meals in our room.\n",

      "Text: We just returned from our first time staying at this hotel. We booked on Priceline and (I think) we got a really good deal. I was hoping to find a decent hotel that we could afford on a Saturday night, that was in a good downtown location. I couldn't have asked for more. After hearing so much about the Metro and how easy it is to use and the convenience, we figured we'd give it a try. And how perfect, this hotel is built on top of a Metro station. Not all stations have parking though, and since it costs $33/day to park at the hotel, we chose a nearby station that did offer free parking on weekends. We left the car there overnight Saturday to Sunday with no problems. And free! We arrived at the hotel around 1pm and inquired about check in. They said they don't start that until 4pm. It wasn't a problem, we just continued with our sightseeing and riding the Metro. We came back to the hotel around 4:30 and checked in with no problem. We had a room with two double beds overlooking the roads and also a nice view of the harbor. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. I personally loved the blackout shades they had on the windows. This is so important when trying to sleep in when I'm on vacation and not all hotels have them! A definite plus in my book. We didn't choose to eat at the restaurant at the hotel, because of hearing how pricey it is, but at least you have it as an option. We did use the hotel pool for a short period of time (it was pretty crowded) but a nice little refreshment after walking all day. Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hotel downtown so you don't have to drive everywhere, this is your place. It has character and may need some updating (which I guess they are working on based on the construction we saw going on), but it met all of our needs. If you are someone who needs complete peace and quiet during your stay, this might not be for you. You can definitely hear the trains going in and out. And from what I can see on their website, I think I saved almost half of a normal night's stay by booking through Priceline.\n",

      "Text: This is a lovely hotel. Our room, on the 14th floor, had one of the most comfortable king sized beds I've ever slept on. The pillows were amazing & the down comforter & sheets were excellent quality. Everything was spotless. Loved the Starbuck's coffee in the room. The staff was very helpful & accommodating even when we asked to change rooms. The first room, though it was removed from the elevators, received reverberating elevator noise. Be aware...Sheraton parking is expensive at $45 a night. We thought we would save $$ by parking in the City Centre garage lot directly across the street. The sign appeared to state $16 for overnight/all day parking. But, the charge was $49! The parking attendant said it was a change & written in the fine print on the sign. We couldn't see the fine print even after she told us. Just don't make the same mistake!\n",

Nonetheless, I continued to spend hours researching other hotels before finally deciding on Palomar. The reviews were great and now, having just returned from there today, I can definitely concur. The staff is inviting and accomodating, they will recommend restaurants, make reservations for you, print out directions, etc. The complimentary popsicles and ice water are a nice touch on a hot day. The complimentary wine reception in the lobby from 5-6 each evening was always bustling. Our room was enormous - an \"executive king\" - must have been 550 sq. feet with an entire wall of floor to ceiling windows. The restaurant was pricey for breakfast, I thought. We did have calamari there one night and it was excellent The bartender, Joe, was wonderful. Dupont CIrcle and the Metro are just up the street. Many have said, but the Metro is the best way to get around - fast, clean and safe. We had lunch at Front Page on New Hampshire St. off Dupone Circle, very good, dinner at James Hobans across the street, just ok. Crepes place across the street was great. A 20-30 minute walk down P street to Georgetown - and it's a great walk by historic homes. We had dinner at Agraria on the waterfront in Georgetown and it was fantastic!\n",

The hotel also allowed dogs, which was a plus for our Portuguese Water dog who was treated like royalty. The four of us, including our two teen-aged sons, loved the hotel. Aside from the amenities, including a great fitness center, outdoor pool, coffee/newspapers each morning, free wine/crackers each night, the staff was incredibly nice and accommodating. We had a superior suite, which permitted the parents to stay in the bedroom, and the boys in the adjacent living room with a pullout and second TV. For breakfast, there is a crepe place across the street, along with a bagel place and many other spots. You really can't go wrong with this place. Note that they charge for parking each night, which can add up, but unfortunately that is typical of most DC hotels.\n",

All major downtown sights are an easy walk. Also, the Bart trains are not far; if you don't mind walking 4 blocks and don't have a ton of luggage, I recommend using Bart to get to the Rex from the airport.\n",
      "Atmosphere - Polished and serene, with a european feel minus any \"attitude.\" My small, immaculate room on the second floor was completely silent - absolutely no view, but I really didn't care becase the decor was lovely and fun. Nice size bathroom too. Somehow, I lucked out and had a window air conditioner, but I am not sure if all rooms have this.\n",
      "Service - Front desk staff are attentive and hardworking. Cafe Andree has great food at surprisingly low prices. Even room service was inexpensive. The business center is convenient (no charge), and my room was promptly cleaned every day.\n",
      "Price - At $175 per night booked on the Rex website, I received a voucher for a full breakfast each morning and tickets to the Asian Art Museum. Well worth it, no regrets.\n",

      "Text: Stayed for 5 nights on our first trip to New York. Hotel is in an excellent location and we had no trouble finding our way around. The hotel was of a very high standard and efficiently run. Our room was a good size with two comfy (if high) double beds. We were on the back of the hotel with side views of the Hudson river.The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels, shampoo,shower gel and body lotion.I thought it was windy,as we were quite high up, but it was the sound of the lift. It didn't cause any inconvenience though. We could probably have found somewhere less expensive to stay but were warned that hotels in New York can leave a lot to be desired. The menu was rather expensive but it is more fun going out to eat, New York is such an atmosphoric place. The only downside was that internet access is expensive but then New York as a whole is expensive.\n",

      "Text: I had the untimely experience of getting stuck in San Antonio with my spouse after a business trip, San Antonio not being the first place that comes to mind when spending time with a spouse for me, but I have to say that we took a chance on this brand new property and had the most incredible time.\n",
      "A hotel stay is made of a few key elements and here is my opinion on them for this property:\n",
      "Cleanliness: Without a question these people know what it means to make a guest feel that they care about the upkeep on this place. There was someone on our floor cleaning everyday during working business hours. There was a friendly employee in the lobby that seemed to love her job and meeting guests. It was just refreshing to see that this was not an area taken for granted.\n",
      "Location: While not on what they locally refer to as “the loop”, this property is located on the Riverwalk and is just a step enough away to get some well needed peace and quiet from time to time.\n",
      "Rooms: Fantastic!!! Every room is, again clean, arranged as a two-room suite, which is nice if you want to leave a loved one sleeping quietly in the bedroom as well as spacious in comparison to other properties.\n",
      "Value: You will pay for parking $29, you will pay for internet $10, but you will not pay for breakfast (everyday) nor the evening reception (again everyday) and while there be cheaper locations in the area, the overall value is unmatched. Great room! Nice view. New property. Free food/drink.\n",
      "Last but certainly not least in my book:\n",
      "Service: Unmatched! The valets were polite, and speedy. The folks in breakfast were friendly and always looking to help. My true pleasure came in dealing with the front desk folk. I want to commend several of them; namely Katlyn who always greeted us with a smile, Tim who was both polite and professional, Madison who seemed to know more about San Antonio than I think anyone else on the property and then Ronnie who was introduced to us by Madison as her manager and I have to say this young man is a true professional. He was engaging, professional and personable. He took time to learn about us and the nature of our trip and sought out ways to make it better than it started. If this is the person who is training your team I commend his efforts, job well done. He made sure everyone knew our names and I felt that if we needed anything that he and his team would jump at the chance. The front desk served service like it was the blue plate special and they had to give out as much as they could before the day ended. I am sold.\n",

We were greeted with complimentary champagne in late afternoon and each time we have stayed in a different room or suite, all of them spacious, well-maintained, all of the amenities you would expect in a four star hotel, and, on the west side, you can enjoy a view of the Mississippi River lazily flowing by, a scene in late afternoon with a beautiful sunset in the background takes you back a century. General Manager Karl Friedrich and his excellent staff make each guest feel welcome, and the hotel overall has achieved the highest standards in our judgment, and we have been a few places. Paulette's Restaurant is the Inn's four-star restaurant that consistently earns its \"Most Romantic\" and \"Best Continental\" designation, clearly a Memphis favorite made even more memorable by our waitress, Donna, who knows the menus by heart and guided us to some delicious grouper and salmon dishes with lobster bisque, homemade raspberry sorbet (\"they make it every three hours!\") and a french crepe featuring locally grown plums (\" grown on a nearly farm on Highway 51\"). The cosy, welcoming atmosphere of the Inn and its superb restaurant and staff that aims to please at every turn will amaze you and keep you coming back. We have found our little escape!\n",

I got an email from the concierge a few days later with requests for personalizing the room (pillow type, toiletries, etc) and everything I requested was in the room when I arrived.\n",

      "One thing I didn't appreciate was that the Affinia charges for the use of their umbrellas. Considering how Chicago was having major rain and thunderstorms during my visit, I found the fee ridiculous. Why should I have to pay to use an umbrella that I'm going to return in one piece?

The Hotel is perfectly positioned in mid town manhattan. there are plenty of delis and restaurants near by. the subway is just 5 minutes away and it's within walking distance of the Chrysler building, Grand central station and 5th Avenue. What more could I add? I reserved the bunk room- which has no en suite. You could say it was an upmarket hostel... but it never felt like a hostel. It is truly a hotel. They have wonderful outdoor space for chilling around or eating food- around by the reception and upstairs on the roof top terrace! Our concierge was without a doubt one of the most helpful people ever. the staff are very friendly and will help you with any problems. the shared bathrooms are fantastic- clean and funky (thanks to the piped music!)

I asked about the rate and was told $329. When I asked if they could do any better, I was immediately given a rate of $249. Our room was on the 25th floor and was a corner room. We had amazing city views and two entire walls were windows. My only issue with this hotel was with the tv of all things. The cabinet holding it was in front of one of the windows and because of this I guess, it was not very tall. This made the tv at a weird low angle. Even though it was a flat screen, the picture was not very good. And surprisingly, there is no free tv. Everything is pay per view, and then not many choices. I thought this was odd since I can't remember staying hotel that didn't offer free tv channels. The bathroom was small, but it was very clean and since it was only one night it was fine.

Coming back to the Peninsula after 3 years was as it has to be: the \"welcome back\" greeting, the service, the summer special upgrade to an executive suite (awsome bathroom with a view on Michigan avenue), the environment and not to forget the service. Special mention for reception and concierge who had always a listing ear and ready to make your stay as confortable as you wish. So, for me it was good \"to be back\". If you want a hotel without negative surprises with a stable level of (very) good quality of service, do not hesitate. Try out also the food from the Shanghai Terrace or The Lobby (yes I skipped Avenues because I did not want to have dinner alone, but I tried it out previously and it was good). The Peninsula is may be not the cheapest around :), but price/quality it suits me perfect.\n",

Having decided \"what the hell, I'm a tourist, so don't be ashamed to do the touristy stuff\", I put my trust in the Tripadvisor reviews which rate this hotel so highly and was not disappointed in the slightest. I booked the \"A Discovery Awaits\" package which included Valet Parking, breakfast at the Blue Mermaid Chowder House, and Cable Car/Bus/Tram passes. I upgraded our room in advance to a \"King Bay View\" room on the grounds that several reviews complained the rooms were on the small size. So I can't comment on the standard room - however I can highly recommend this kind of room, although it is pricey. Be aware that the view is partial and certainly not uninterrupted. However the room is large, spotlessly clean and full of quirky touches, colours and furniture. Staff were absolutely delightful, made us feel so welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble. Breakfast was fine - of course you can get better, but it was included in our rate and was well cooked, with friendly service. Parking is expensive if not included in your rate. The Powell/Hyde cable car turnaround really is close - in fact it was under our window, less than a two minute walk from the front of the hotel.\n",
      "I'm sure there are many excellent hotels in SF. We took a chance with the Argonaut and it delivered on every level. It was so refreshing to stay somewhere where you didn't feel the interior designers had borrowed the Holdiday Inn decor guide (even the \"themed\" Vegas hotels can be formulaic in their layout and decor). Some may find it a bit OTT - we thought it was cool and we'll be back.\n",

The hotel is due for a makeover - it's not that it's old, it's just a little lacking in style, but I was told that would happen in the low-season. I liked how unpretentious it was and how friendly people were. Bed was firm; sheets were fine (not excellent cotton but not terrible), and the TV moved on the wall to adjust to my viewing needs. Room was spacious. I would go again - the price point is right on for the level of hotel - it felt like it was priced right in the middle to low end of the kind of hotel it is. Only downside?

They have two flat screen TVs, settee, armchair, coffee table, work desk, free internet (wifi & wire), table lamp, ergonomic chair (very few hotels have these and it really helps when you're working). There is also a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board. The beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet. The bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror, good water pressure, and plenty of towels. \n",
      "You can request a room exercise kit if you don't want to go to the gym, and an exercise video. A great idea (I keep promising myself that I'll get around to asking for one... one day!). The swimming pool is out the front of the hotel, it is a good size and has a jacuzzi. It overlooks the carpark, but you're not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is.

They take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when you're ready to be collected. It's like having a personal chauffeur. They will drop / collect you at restaurants, shops (Memorial Mall), wherever within the radius. \n",

I've travelled all over the world and in an average year, spend 150-180 nights in hotels. I can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams I've ever encountered. I won't name them all because I'm bound to miss someone, but when you have Nancy or La-La starting to worry about whether you've returned to the hotel at your regular time, or when the breakfast team give you a hug, then you know that the team really do care. They all take a great pride in their work, in looking after their guests, and they really do work as a team. Hilton - take note, your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team.\n",

      "- Room safe - plenty of space to put one, so would be good to have.\n",
      "- In-room coffee facilities are good for coffee - but not good for tea. Tea needs boiling water and it shouldn't be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste (you can tell I'm from the UK). An in-room kettle would be great.

We got a rate of $187 per night through the hotels website - and when you factor in the complimentary breakfast - that's a pretty good deal. There is plenty to eat - not just danish & coffee. They had hot cinnamon rolls, cold cereal, carton milk, eggs (scrambled or omelet depending on the day), bacon or sausage (depending on the day) biscuits and gravy (daily), and then breads, english muffins and bagels. If this doesn't work for you, there is a Denny's literally right around the corner - as well as a Walgreen in case you need pop/water, medicine, sunscreen, snacks, toothpaste, film developing, socks - or anything else you forgot or think you might need. \n",

Manhattan is great for clothing and shoes because there is no sales tax on an item if it is under $110.. so what you see on the tag is what you pay.. unlike other American states.\n",

It is a treck to the metro station (about 3 long blocks), so if your children are younger than 6-7 I would probably choose something with a closer stop. Otherwise, we parked our car & forgot it for 2 days. . . public transport was very efficient and the hotel is close enough to the White House to walk there. A cab to Georgetown for dinner was less than $10. The breakfast was plentiful (both hot & cold items) & delicious - much appreciated by the mother of 3 hungry kids. The staff was very pleasant & the children loved our maid's creative handiwork with their stuffed animals/bedspreads. The beds were comfortable, pillows & linens were good quality. After walking/sightseeing all day, it was nice to come home to a large suite that was big enough for 3 adults & 3 children. The lobby area was very nice also- I don't think it needs updating as some other reviewers noted. We enjoyed our stay & would recommend to both families or business travellers. My only complaint would be the cost of valet parking, but I did see a public parking garage across the street that might be less expensive.\n",

It has a great location right on the northbound lanes of Rt. 6, and right next to I-10. The room was clean, comfortable, quiet. There are a lot of choices for TV viewing, though I didn't have much time for that. I LIKE the fact that you can program the AC unit so that the fan keeps running, even if the compressor shuts off. I'm one of those who needs \"white noise\" to sleep.\n",
      "Drurys provide breakfast and supper. In my opinion, breakfast is better because all of the normal breakfast foods are available - fruit, cereals (including hot oatmeal), eggs, pastries, waffles, pancakes, etc. etc. Supper is a little less exciting in that it's mainly hot dogs, chips, etc. They do provide a basic salad of mainly lettuce. Hot baked potatoes and tortilla chips are available, too. Free soda is also offered. After supper, popcorn is offered. So, at least there is something available for supper if you don't have alternate plans.\n",

In the mad rush to be \"green\" about everything, many hotels have opted for whacko toilets that use less water. The problem is that they often don't flush everything! --- and you wind up flushing 3 or 4 times to get everything down and use even more water, and certainly more time. \n",
      "One note of caution - This hotel is very easy to get to EXCEPT if you're coming toward it on Rt. 6 from the north. In that case, follow these directions: Get off Rt. 6 on the two right lanes marked for I-10. The exit ramp will crest a hill and then come down to the first light. MAKE SURE you are in the third lane (NOT in either of the left two lanes since BOTH of them are left turn ONLY. I watched three people get tickets for going straight from lane #2!). As soon as you go through this light, get into the FAR left lane. Go through the next light. At the third light, make a left from the far left lane (as though entering the ramp for I-10), but make a u-turn back onto the northbound lanes of Rt. 6. Get into the far right lane, since the Drury will be just ahead past the first light. Confused? Sorry. :-) Hopefully not.\n",

      "Two things that I would like to point out as to why this hotel was excellent. #1- I loved the fact that the hotel made a true effort to highlight its rich history with beautiful photographs and pieces presented like a museum display. I really enjoyed taking my time reading about some of the pieces, and looking at the Ansel Adams photographs. The Clock is still in prominent display, and the annual Christmas sugar castle at the entrance is every child's dream. Lovely!\n",
      "#2- The hotel provided a choice and true incentive for people to be green. For the days that you don't request a sheet change (they still make your bed), you have a choice to add Westin points or a coupon to use at the Coffee stand in the lobby. I felt that this was a good idea to give the customer something back for helping them and also the environment.\n",

      "Text: I bought a deal off of LivingSocial.com. I travelled with my dad to Chicago so we could watch my sister compete in the MIC gymnastics championships. The Raffaello hotel is in a great location. A little off a side street so all the main traffic isn't in front of the hotel. All you have to do is walk a block and you are in front of the John Hancock Center and a big intersection of Michigan Avenue. We arrived early around 12:00pm ish and nothing was ready as I did request a higher floor. So the front desk staff was amazing and held our bags for us as we walked around for a few hours. We came back around 3 and our room still wasn't going to be available until 4:30-5:00. However, they did say they had a handicap room available immediately on lower floor. To be honest I was exhausted and so I said we would take it. GREAT IDEA! Our room had plenty of extra space to move around in. My dad fell asleep as soon as he laid down on the bed! I took a nap too. The beds are very comfy with the nice thick but soft pillows. Something I noticed was the fan/air conditioning. It was on my side of the room and I turned it up full blast and it hardly made any noise at all! This was a huge plus for me.There were plenty of outlets for me to charge up all my electronics after the flight and before the meet. I enjoyed playing with the iHome and my iPod touch. :) The bathroom was large! I don't know if it is like that in all the rooms or just because we had a handicap room. The shower was my absolute favorite. It is a rainfall shower head but it still had plenty of pressure unlike others I have experienced. \n",

The sitting area alone was 12' x 15', outfitted with a big L-shaped couch that folded out to a Queen bed, a big ottoman, business desk, wet bar and dresser. It was separated from the sleeping area by an attractive partial wall/room divider. The decor was modern but warm, not stark, and the room was immaculate. Everything--hallways, elevators, carpets--were spotless. The beds and pillow were comfy, and the air conditioner magically kept the room at the perfect temp noiselessly. There were marble countertops, a full length mirror. In-room Wi-Fi was painless to log onto, didn't need a passcode. A swiveling 42\" flat screen TV allowed us to watch from just about anywhere in the room. \n",
      "There was plenty of parking and a security guard was walking around the grounds at night. Late check-in was no problem as the desk is staffed 24 hours.

      "The downsides: Our room faced the freeway so there was ongoing traffic noise, not enough to keep us awake but if you are a light sleeper you may want to request a room on the other side. The bathroom light/fan was loud and the shower squealed, also the sink was outside of the shower area so it was hard to use it and not wake your hotel-mate. Our key cards didn't work well at the back door so we had to swipe and swipe several times before it would let us in. Not enough to prevent us from coming back though.\n",
      "It's a short drive to restaurants, fast food, and stores, and easy to find just off the freeway. After one night we were offered a special price at another hotel where the rest of the team was staying--we said \"NO\"--we were just so comfortable where we were! \n",

The bathroom had the usual sign about saving the world by not changing the linens every day, but there were NO towel racks upon which to hang said linens--on the one wall where there should have been a rack, there was a picture of a cactus. There was exactly one hook, next to the tub. I am a Hilton Honors member and as such, I get free bottled water just for being a member. I am also a Hyatt Gold Passport member, which got me a bottle of water in the room that was mine for only $6.00 (in Phoenix, in June). My membership was also supposed to get me a paper, which I never got. The service in the restaurant upstairs was pretty bad: we ordered at 7:00 but didn't get our dinner until 8:30, at which point I was ready to eat my napkin. But the worst was the temperature in the room. When we got there it was in the 80s, and we couldn't get the thermostat to work; we called and asked them to fix it. When we got back from our meetings later that evening, the temperature was in the low 60s and still going down, with the fan on high--it was like being in a meat locker. I called at 9 to ask them to fix it, then called at 9:30 and again at 10. Finally at 10:15 I lost it and called once again, asking for someone to come immediately. At 10:30 someone finally came to fix the thermostat. The only thing good I can say about the hotel is that it is convenient to the conference center. Period.\n",

It has those in abundance, but it has something else that truly sets it above and apart from even what most would otherwise consider the best. The Management and Staff of the Iroquois New York genuinely care about the pleasure you take from your stay with them. No, it is not overt or even subtly obsequious treatment that lacks sincerity and substances. It is exclusively about how you, the guest, perceives the physical characteristics of the hotel, the merits of its collective efforts, and the overall attitude and manner the entire package is delivered. They could not do it better. Moreover, no hotel my wife and I have ever stayed in forty-two plus years of traveling in Asia, Europe, Canada, The Caribbean, and the United States has come even close.\n",

The room and amenities were all top notch, and the location was perfect for exploring Beale Street (a half block away). In fact the location here is actually more convenient than the Peabody, which is another block away. From our balcony we could listen to the great band playing in Handy Park, and enjoy the sights of downtown Memphis including Peabody Place. For the price, this hotel can't be beat! (As an aside, if you're looking for great ribs, hit the Blues City Cafe on Beale Street. They were incredible. Also, for some real Delta Blues check out \"Dr. Feelgood\" Potts. He was playing at the Blues Hall in the Rum Boogie Cafe. A great harp player and showman!)\n",

      "Text: We just returned from a 4 night stay. When we arrived rather late on Saturday night, June 11, we asked if we could have a room with a view. We were told there were only two rooms left and they had parking lot views. Upon arriving in our room, it reeked of sewage. Our bellman noticed the smell and offered to have the maids come and spray. They arrived promptly, but we knew spraying the room would not eliminate the odor. We contacted the front desk and were told the only other available room had wet carpet. We were tired from our trip from the East Coast and asked the front desk to find us another hotel. Then, after much discussing among themselves, they found another room. Our very kind bellman, Dick, then drove us up the cliffs and carried our bags again in the heat to a suite with a beautiful view. Hilton certainly has a fantastic employee in Dick. He knew we were ready to leave the Tapatio Cliffs and find something else, but he was so kind pointing out all the good features of the hotel. We were so happy with our suite with the view, all our bad thoughts about the resort quickly disappeared. Dick then called us when he got back down to the front desk to assure us that we could have the suite for our 4 nights and not have to move to less expensive room the next day. \n",
      " When we return to Phoenix, we will definitely want to stay at the Cliffs, and will probably pay the extra money for the view. It was so wonderful to sit on the patio and drink coffee early in the morning and enjoy that view.\n",

      "Text: The room was tiny and dark; lamp light was necessary in the daytime, as my room's window looked out onto a dingy air shaft. The furniture was significantly chipped, scarred, and mismatched, the mattress hard. I wish I had taken pictures of this room. I concur with the reviewer who mentioned allergies, I found my eyes itching and watering etc. due to something in the air. I had returned to New York to take a college comprehensive exam for my masters degree, booking the Warwick via Expedia. I was excited to stay at this historical and elegant (as pictured on the website) hotel. For what I paid ($260+ per night) it was definitely a let down. I asked for a room change at the front desk but was told I had paid for the \"deluxe\" and would need to pay more to \"upgrade\" to a non-air shaft view. I'm sure such an illustrious hotel would have higher quality accommodations; Cary Grant lived there for goodness sake! But either they have quite a disparity in room offerings (and thus prices?) and/or the management has changed and it is not what it used to be. I felt as though the hotel cared less about my satisfaction. That is not the way to impress clientel, in my humble opinion. I could deal with all this for just two nights, since I wanted to study for my exam, but most memorable and disheartening was the rudeness of the staff! According to the hotel description, a coffee pot was included in the room rate and would be there upon arrival. As it was not, I requested one. The man who delivered it practically threw it at me. On top of that, upon checkout, I was charged a per day EXTRA surcharge fee! It wasn't a lot, but I felt cheated even further. I will give the Warwick credit for being in a good (though not spectacular) location. Unless you can afford to spend buckets of money on a hotel, I would not recommend the Warwick, because you just don't know what you'll get.\n",

      "Text: First off, let me say that this is not a review of a Champaign tour or any of that stuff. This is a review of actually staying overnight (2 nights) at The Mansion on O. A friend of ours was in town and booked a room here. It was a suite so he asked us to stay. \n",
      "Parking here was an extra $30 per night and parking was behind one of the nearby buildings down an alleyway. Still, the car was fine even if parking was pretty pricey. Check in was pretty easy - entry was through a door at street level so you didn't have to climb the outside steps whilst schlepping your luggage. The husband of the husband/wife team who run the place took care of us and was friendly and helpful. He gave us a mini tour which was great. We were greeted in a room that looks like a library. Our room was on the 3rd. floor (I think) and it was a suite with a bedroom, livingroom, bathroom, kitchenette and an outside deck.\n",
      "Okay, here's where it gets hairy. The kitchenette was up some stairs and off of the bedroom area. It appeard to have seen better days and I'm not sure the appliances worked but there were no pots/pans. It wasn't any too clean, either so we avoided that area. Off the kitchen was a door to a deck. It looked pretty precarious - wires hanging nearby, etc. I was afraid of stepping out there for fear of falling through - seriously. The bathroom was laid out so that someone could be taking a shower and the sink area was accessable. It was fine but there was carpet throughout the bathroom (here's a ewww factor). The carpet was not real clean as none of the place was very clean - everything was very dusty. Some lint was on the carpet - it was there when we first got there and it was still there when we left - I was careful not to walk barefooted on the floors. We had the sitting room area with a pull out couch. The couch was very comfortable and done up really nicely. The pillows were comfortable and the mattress must have had a topper on it because it was not at all like any pull out couch I've slept on. I'll give them credit here. On the other hand, there was a faux fireplace in the sittingroom area. It was not quite against the wall because the entire wall was hung with art work - all for sale - even behind the fireplace!! There was no place to put your personal items such as a table, etc. because every inch was covered with \"stuff\". There was a huge walk in closet which stored some of \"stuff\" but plenty of room to hang cloths. There was a desk and after moving around the things all over the desk we used that to put our personal items on. As others have said, it's a little overdone with the kitch. There was stuff literally everywhere and everything (except the guitars) was for sale. It was like staying at an estate sale or at your eccentric great aunts old house with all kinds of crap laying around - except your aunt may have dusted from time to time. There is no central a/c so window units were around which wasn't a problem but then you got to looking at the windows and all the peeling paint outside. Maintenance is not one of the strong points of this property.\n",
      "Our room was situated behind a bookcase in the middle of a stairway. The door was a bookcase and the lock was a long spike that you put into the side of the bookcase which went into the wall to keep the door shut. From the inside there was a kind of lock at the top of the door to keep it closed. The spike, when you were gone, was just laid on the shelf behind a magazine or book to conceal it. At first, we put the spike on that shelf - but we were in the room with the inside latch set when some people who were attending a wedding attempted to get into our room. They found the spike, inserted it in the hole and we were locked in!! We had to call the front desk to have them open the room. There was no way to secure the room when you were gone. The sign on the door that said the room was occupied didn't do much good because we had several people tried to get in. When you were out for dinner, you had no choice but to leave the spike on the shelf so anyone could have access to the room. This did not give me a warm fuzzy as I had my laptop and other valuables in the room. \n",
      "I really wanted to like this place because it's the type of place that would grab one's fancy. The rooms were not cookie-cutter rooms like a regular hotel. They were unique and very interesting. The cabin room with a loft area next to ours was really nice as were many of the other rooms we saw. The kitchen was available on a kind of \"help yourself\" basis to fix your own breakfast I guess. We didn't go there because we went walking in the morning and found a place nearby for breakfast. I guess I'd have loved it had they weeded out the junk, cleaned it better by removing all or most of the \"for sale\" stuff from the rooms. Instead, it looks like they're not sure what they want this place to be - an estate sale where you can sleep or a bed and breakfast with interesting art pieces for sale. They need to go one way or another but at present, this isn't working well. \n",
      "I don't know what my friend paid for this room but from the pricing I saw online it's way over the top for what you get. I've traveled for work and stayed at some beautiful B & B's and top notch hotels that weren't near the published price of this place and were much nicer. Published rates for The Fireplace Suite - if you are not a \"member\" (whatever that means) is $900 per night - about $700 per night overpriced in my opinion - and I'm being generous here.\n",
      "I would rate this much higher if I were simply taking a tour rather than staying here because, for a tour the place is really amazing with all the antiques, artwork and collectibles. The diningroom and main floor where events are held was really nice. The intricate corridors and ways to get from place to place, hidden wine cellar and rooms were neat. All that is great - it's the staying and seeing how difficult it was that drove me to the rating I'm giving. Maybe the answer is to run this as a museum and forget about the B&B part?? There seems to be no focus to this place - is it a retreat for musicians? Is it a B&B? Is it an estate sale? I'm not sure but the Mansion on O St. is definitely unique!\n",

There is no door to the sink and the door to the toilet/shower is blurred glass. You can't see through clearly, but you can definitely see through! So if you are staying with your partner, no issue.

At $15-and-change per person, it seemed fairly reasonably priced for unlimited access to both hot and cold items.

In the evenings it's very busy (which is good if you want to meet people), but during the day and before 6:00 it's a quiet area to relax in. You could just sit there and look at the cosmopolitan modern decorations and furniture for hours and never get bored. It also has free internet acess, whereas in the room there's a fee. The lounge and lobby is on the second level; the first level is an entrance with water on the roof and walls (very worth seeing!)\n",

The room had a desk,an upholstered chair and ottoman for sitting, a comfortable king-sized bed, a flat screen TV, a stereo receiver and speakers, a DVD player, a mini bar, and an in-room safe. The tiled bathroom was very nice, with both a soaking tub and a separate shower and a large counter top surrounding the sink (plenty of room for toiletries, shaver, etc).

The hotel is within walking distance of almost everything you want to see in Boston. The staff is amazingly friendly and called me by my name everytime they saw me. The manager, Dan, even sent up a bottle of wine for me to consume after a long day walking the city. As others posters indicate, the hotel is not inexpensive but I snagged a pretty good rate online (off-season, of course). The only little criticism (not really, cause I like the hotel so much) is that there is no coffee/tea pot in the room. However, they sent up a pot of water for me at no charge. If you visit Boston, I would definitely go see the Boston Symphony (performance or open rehearsal) and spend time on Newbury and Hanover Streets (as well as all of the historical stuff Boston has to offer).

      "The first encounter with Lenox staff is the doormen, who are polite, helpful and friendly. They really do help create a fabulous first impression of this hotel! And the strong Boston accent is a real welcome when you are new to the city!\n",
      "The hotel Lobby is immaculate and greets you with a really warm and inviting atmosphere – especially during the cold month of February. The roaring fire, tasteful décor and mood lighting all help to set the tone for the hotel – welcoming, with a sense of luxury and charm. \n",
      "Before check in, you are greeted by the concierge staff and asked if you would like your bags taken to your room. Obviously, being in America, a tip is expected, but as you are politely asked if you would like this service, you feel under no pressure. We did take up this service and felt that it was well worth the tip.\n",
      "Upon check in, we were informed that we would be staying in a Junior Suite and within minutes, were presented with our key cards – check in at The Lenox is quick and easy! The front desk staff are more than polite; they did all they could to not only welcome us when we arrived, but also made us feel welcome throughout our whole stay, each morning asking how we were and if they could do anything to help, and each evening asking how our day had been. \n",
      "The corridors and communal areas do not let the hotel down; décor is fresh and tasteful, corridors clean and quiet and there are also services such as lifts, ice and water machines etc. We did not use the fitness centre, so cannot comment on this, but from what we saw of it, it look as though it was well equipped with all you would need for a work out.\n",
      "Our room was absolutely beautiful. The furniture and décor fits in with the old feel of the hotel, yet it offers luxury and comfort. Having emailed the hotel prior to our trip to inform them that it was one of our party member’s 30th Birthday, requesting a good view of the city from our room, I was overwhelmed to find that not only had the staff met the request of giving us a room with a lovely view of the city, but they had also left us a welcome note and basket, filled with American goodies – Hershey’s chocolate, bags of pretzels, Boston souvenirs etc. We really were touched by this and it just shows how the staff at The Lenox do go that extra mile!\n",
      "I slept superbly each of the 5 nights of my stay – in the room are two double beds – they are comfortable and you are offered plenty of spare pillows and blankets for the cold winter nights (although these were not needed as there was a very effective heating/air con system which allowed you to fully control the temperature of the room). \n",
      "In the spacious room, we also had a large walk in wardrobe with plenty of hanging space. This wardrobe also housed a very user friendly safe. There was plenty more storage space in the form of a chest of draws; There was also a very large, flatscreen TV which offered loads of entertainment channels. The fridge had complimentary bottled water, which was restocked everyday and the ice machine was conveniently right outside our room.\n",
      "The room offered many other comforts, such as an I-pod docking station, desk and business chair, sofa and coffee table and a beautiful fireplace (not working – just for effect). Oh, and the nightly turn-down service with chocolates on your pillow is a lovely extra touch!\n",
      "The bathroom was cleaned thoroughly everyday and every detail was thought of – hairdryer, phone in the bathroom, plenty of clean towels (if needed, although The Lenox are an environmentally friendly hotel and do encourage re-use), extractor fan, dressing gowns, complimentary toiletries and even ornate gold-effect taps! It really was lovely!\n",
      "When we holiday in America, we do like to get out and try the local food, so we did not eat breakfast in the hotel. Although, each morning, there are complimentary tea and coffee facilities set up in the lobby. Nor did we eat dinner at The City Table – but we have read excellent reviews about this restaurant. We did visit the Hotel’s Irish Bar on a couple of occasions – The Solas – and this was a lovely atmosphere, with TV screens for sports fans. We ate here on one evening and I can thoroughly recommend this place to eat – especially considering that food is served til late – 1am if I remember correctly - great after a long day of sightseeing. On this note, it is also worth mentioning that although we did not use room service, the menu was very reasonably priced. \n",
      "I have stayed in 5 star hotels in the Caribbean, been on 4/5* cruise liners, and I can honestly say that this is possibly the nicest hotel I have stayed in. The staff work so hard to make your stay special and it felt so great to return ‘home’ to The Lenox after a day of walking through the city.\n",
      "Practical info on the hotel – nearest T Station is Copley (green line) and this is about a 2 minute walk. You are located right by The Prudential Centre (Tower and Shopping Mall) and Copley Square, with Trinity Church and The John Hancock Tower just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. A Taxi from Logan cost us around $30, including tip. You must also try Whiskey’s Bar, just down the street!\n",

We were then greeted by a very friendly concierge and asked if we were in need of a complimentary towncar any time during our stay. We said yes and asked where we were heading. We told them a concert and a car would be waiting for us when we were ready. We headed up to the room, and our bags soon followed. Upon entering, you feel as though you are in a posh manhattan apartment and NOT a hotel room! the decor is fabulous and immediately we felt pampered. waiting for us was a plate of cheese, crackers, and chocolate covered strawberries (which was very fresh), along with a fully stocked fridge and snack draw with everything imaginable that you could want. As we were getting ready for the night, my cousin realized she forgot her heels in the car and went down to the lobby to retrieve her car to get them. the conceirge told us that there was no need and he would send someone to get the heels for her out of the car. Ten minutes later he showed up at our door with the shoes. we headed downstairs to take the towncar to the concert. the driver opened the door for us and said that he had jay z playing in the car for us!

Frankly, there was absolutely no deficiencies to overcome. This hotel is was excellent top to bottom. Check in was supremely efficient; as if they had been waiting for me to show up for some time. The room is the standard layout, which is not a criticism, just a comment to provide some bearings. The room, a queen bed, was a comfortable size. It was beautifully appointed and supremely clean. Proof that luxury can be done right without the need to garish opulence. Staff members were excellent. Obviously, Omni’s training of their staff is top notch and their expectations of service are nothing but first class. Other guests in the party were greeted by name and they also had stayed only one night—amazing. This is one of the few hotels that I was truly disappointed to leave without the opportunity to experience more—a rarity even in some of my favorite hotels.

The Drury Plaza is an absolute gem!! We stayed in the new tower building in a huge riverview suite. The room had a huge balcony that overlooked the riverwalk and downtown. It was very spacious with 2 chairs. The hotel is located at the beginning of the riverwalk, but it's location is excellent, because it is quiet at night, but it has quick and easy access to all that the riverwalk has to offer.\n",
      "Everything about this hotel is excellent. From the moment we checked in, the service was great, the people were so friendly and ready to help. Everyone that you walk by says \"hello\" and asks how your stay is going. The cleaning staff are very friendly and accomodating, and always smiling. The true bonus here is the incredible amount of food that the hotel offers at no extra charge. They have a huge buffet breakfast with hot items like eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy (yum!). They also have a \"5:30 Kickback\" cocktail hour which is amazing!!! Each person gets three free (alcoholic!) drinks and tons of yummy \"bar food\" snacks like nachos and chicken fingers. If you stay on the weekends though, get there early!!! The lines for food/drinks were very loooong, but worth it! You could absolutely stay at this hotel and never have to buy any food--although that would be a shame because San Antonio has some of the best! \n",

Some bums do hang out under the overpass that you walk through to get to/from the hotel to riverwalk, however, this has nothing to do with the hotel, and it not something that they can fix. The bums are nowhere near the hotel!! Plus, the hotel is only accessable with your hotel card, so there is no chance that random people can just wander in. It's a city, the bums are there-- ignore them and they ignore you. Plus, you can walk on the \"street side\" to get to the hotel as well, if that makes you more comfortable. \n",

There is free WiFi throughout the hotel and a couple of free computers available with a printer to print boarding passes. There is a small exercise room in the basement. They have free chilled purified water on every floor and bottles are available. The only annoyance was the construction work in the street, starting at 7 am, that definitely woke me up.\n",

There was plenty of shopping, dining and tourist attractions just a short walk away. The hotel offered outstanding amenities from the complimentary wine reception, well equipped fitness facility and knowledgable conceierge services. I was very pleased when we called the front desk late one evening to inquire about food delivery services in the area and we were promptly brought a packet of area restaurants that offered 24 hours delivery services. The staff at this hotel goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is exceptional. I would DEFINITELY recommend The Muse Hotel. You will not be disappointed with your choice!\n",

The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center. For the price, I don't think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle.\n",
      "The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young (nearly all under 40 years). The rooms are quite small, (although not all the same size for doubles), and the room was clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink (I thought it was malfunctioning), but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasn't hip enough to figure it out. One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew.\n",
      "Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor. The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests (internet service in rooms requires an extra fee). The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights.\n",
      "The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways (I was sharing a double room with two other people).\n",
      "My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it. It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.\n",

The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market.

Somehow they have managed, as a brand new establishment, to pull off the ambience of a venerable NYC institution (think the Algonquin) while still being contemporary. The rooms hold many nice touches. I am fussy about light, and I particularly appreciated the numerous lighting options and settings. Also loved the floor-to-ceiling window with a great view of the City and its lights. We kept saying that our room somehow reminded us of our former Manhattan apartment, but we didn't know how or why. Now I realize it probably was because we weren't in midtown, and the view of the neighborhood had that, well, neighborhood feel. The minibar held some unique choices (and definite firsts), as well. As others note, the Bowery staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. I don't know where else I have come across staff members -- reception, bellhops, housekeeping, waiters -- who seem so genuinely (as opposed to obsequiously) happy to greet you. The one downside (for us) is that the hotel is just a little too self-consciously \"hip\" at the moment.\n",

I ended up fighting with them for 2 months after my last stay, just to get them to do what they said they would do! I had to follow up with them several times, in order to get them to keep their promises. That is really sad, when you can't even expect them to keep their word. I wont go into any more details of that stay, because it's already in here somewhere. This time, however, we are again.....not happy at all! The ONLY thing this place has to offer is the location. You will find that they are experts at finding ways to get tip money from you by hijacking your luggage, etc. You will find that the drinks they make you in the bar will be TERRIBLE, and cost $15.00 each. They don't even have a blender and cannot make frozen type drinks. Why not? Can't Hilton afford a blender? You will find that the wireless internet service will not stay connected. The signal will go in and out and have to keep trying to re-connect. We had 2 different laptops with us and they both had the same problem. We ended up going accross the street to the Star Bucks to use the internet from there. We also ended up using the Applebees (located inside the Hilton) for drinks. There is NO pool or and NO spa! The gym is very small and poorly equipped. We also expected poliote/respectful/professional staff. And, sadly, this proved to not be true as well. They were less than helpful with us on several occassions and were downright rude as well. We understood that this would be expensive. After all, it's Times Square! But, we also expected things to work! And that the food and drinks would be good (for those prices), and we are sad to report that we cannot give the Hilton a good report. AND that this is the second time in a row! Once in Phoenix and once here in Times Square-New York city. We have been traveling now for over 2 weeks. We went to England, France, Germany, etc. And all of our accomadations at the other places where we stayed, were great!. None of them were Hilton! So we have stayed in different Hotels every night for the last couple of weeks, and everyone did a better job than Hilton. We are Hilton Honours members and have just about decided to give it all up and tell Hilton good-bye! We're also Marriot rewards members. Marriott....here we come!\n",

However, the breakfast left something to be desired. The food that was supposed to be warm was not, and several of the containers were empty or near. The attendant was near, but was engaged in a long conversation with another person, and paid little or no attention to the condition of the breakfast bar. The facility was as nice as I'd expected, and I would stay there again. But I would hope for an improved breakfast service!\n",

Our room was immaculate and much like my first efficiency apartment. For breakfast there was a full buffet with turkey sausage, veggie sausage, local scrambled eggs, whole wheat (delicious) pancakes, a wide variety of breads, coffee, juice, sweet fruits. The building was well maintained and landscaped. Additionally, the hotel utilizes many \"green\" practices. We originally booked for location, but will now add this place as a destination in itself.\n",

There was always something going on during the day and evening. The was music playing around the pool and it had a very family friendly feel. It was just a 2 minute drive to sea world and to mission beach which was lovely and clean. The only thing which was a slight issue was we were upgraded to a room in Bay 1 which include a balcony, when we arrived there was no balcony (we thought) so we went to the front desk and the staff didnt seem to understand what we were trying to get at. In the end they told us that the open air public walkway infront of the room was our balcony. (which wasnt a balcony in anyones books). so ask for a room in the tower or the suits.\n",

The tone was set when I made my reservation with the lovely correspondence from Rose Gonzalez who went above and beyond to insure that our stay was indeed special. In this day and age of impersonal computer generated replies when booking rooms..how refreshing that someone actually wanted to do everything possible to make sure we had a wonderful visit. \n",
      "This personal treatment continued throughout our stay, from the front desk to the valet parking staff. Everyone we encountered seemed to take personal pride in the history and charm of the famous Menger hotel. Every staff member was more than willing to share stories of the history of the Menger with us and their pride in the hotel was obvious and well deserved.\n",
      "The hotel itself is like taking a step back in time. You are literally in spitting distance of the Alamo. Every opportunity we had was spent wandering the hotel - the lobby, the landscaped courtyard, poolside, the various nooks and crannies...and everywhere had reminders of the wonderful history of this hotel. There are old photos, cases with memorabilia and antiques throughout the first floor so it's almost a museum in itself. To stroll where Oscar Wilde once sipped margaritas and to sit in the bar Teddy Roosevelt slammed a few whiskeys and recruited his rough riders was a real treat. We were just close enough to the River Walk to enjoy all of its amenities without all of the noise and late night revelry. A nice bonus was that the trolley stop in front of the Alamo made it a breeze to get around the main sights of the city. \n",
      " Our room was charming and in keeping with the style of the hotel. We were right next to the beautiful wrought iron balcony with the stain glass skylight over the Victorian lobby. The room style was in keeping with the age of the hotel (over 100 yrs.) furnished with Victorian furniture. Our bed could not have been more comfortable. It was in every way exactly what I hoped for. Before we departed, we enjoyed Sunday brunch in the hotel's Colonial Dining Room with its beautiful buffet and a complimentary mimosa.\n",
      "If you are looking for a shiny sparkly lobby, flat screen TVs, granite bathrooms with sleek furnishings, fast elevators and stairs that don't squeak... try any of the many chain hotels in the area.

It was clean and the staff were friendly and reasonably helpful. The room was large. We had a studio suite which had a full kitchen and sitting room. We didn't really use the kitchen as we were out so much but it was nice to have the refrigerator,etc. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom was ok and with no shortage of towels. The a/c - heating system was noisy and we had to turn the fan off in order to sleep. It was a definite plus having the complimentary breakfast each morning. It was quite good and with more variety than I expected. The staff in the a.m. were fantastic. The complimentary dinner/social was ok (served Mon,Tues,Wed). Again more food and variety than I expected...not gourmet for sure but ok and great for families. The hotel was close to the metro which was great but had no restaurants or pubs nearby which was a definite negative. It would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel. Able to walk to most attractions. Hot tub was nice...didn't use the pool. We had an issue with the fee at the hotel. I booked on-line at the Washington.org website. I thought that I was booking directly thru the Marroitt, however apparently it was thru a third party. I was given a price when I booked and then another price from the hotel. The price from the hotel was lower. I called the hotel twice (from Canada) and was told both times that the lower price was what I would pay. Not the case. I called 'the 3rd party' and was told by them that they would call the hotel to talk with the manager to straightened the price out. When we arrived at the hotel I tried to explain the situation to the manager but felt that he totally dismissed us with very little conversation at all. He barely listened to us and walked away while I was talking to him. Not a very nice welcome to the hotel. When I mentioned Marriott rewards he waved his hand and mumbled something about \"no Marriott rewards with this type of booking.\". Not sure what that was all about. Despite the unpleasant experience that we had with the manager we enjoyed the hotel, however I'm not sure that I would stay there again because of that!\n",

Last year when staying there, I was reminded that the hotel opened in the mid 1960s . A few months ago, I tried to get into the hotel and found that rates were nearly 500 per night, thanks to the Hilton Club concept which seems to have cut the available rooms to ordinary folk to about half of the total, resulting in twice the price.\n",
      "I took a chance and decided to stay in Soho, where a pal of mine owns a great jewelry store, and found the above sheraton. When I checked in, the desk staff acted as if I was a long time lost person who had come home for good. In a flash I was in my room, all new and nice, with internet that worked like a charm ( I seem to remember a german phrase - mit raazender geschwindekuit- or something like that- with great speed) and a very very nice room for a very very good price. Best of all, elevators that got you to your room on floor 14 with even more speed than ever in a hotel in new york. No waiting.\n",
      "Once I checked in, I found the staff eager to help me get around the city, and where to walk to. All kinds of flower shops, my pals store, and every imaginable kind of cool stores are available. plus, something you will never see in mid town, nice little bakeries, pizza places, and restaurants of every type. \n",
      "The rooms. like many at any four points sheraton, are modern design, and not the traditional heavy woods,and massive chairs, but very very comfortable and well appointed. There was even a power strip for those of us who think we are to be in touch with 2 phones, two laptops, and of course an ipod. So for the first time in years, my own power strip was deployed to remain in the suitcase. \n",
      "In walking around, I was able to visit my pals store in soho, visit art galleries, and frankly enjoy myself despite having heavy duty finance meetings ever day over 4 days. My worst fear- not being able to get a cab, or being forced to use the subway a lot- were never realised. Despite it being a small hotel at least by gotham city standards, there was always a cab waiting out front. Also the cab fare to LaGuardia was about 10 bucks less than the trip to midtown. \n",

We were in room 224 on the top floor -- the northeast corner -- and found it comfortable, spacious and quiet; we didn't encounter any of the mould issues reported in other reviews, nor were we troubled by noise from the street or elsewhere in the property. The bed was comfortable, the daily cleaning thoroughly adequate if not stellar (there were cobwebs in a couple corners of the room, but the bathroom was spotless every day), and the fridge and microwave were very convenient. One of the huge strengths of this property (note that the signage reads \"Nob Hill Motel\") is its location: it's extremely convenient to Van Ness Avenue and boutitque-y Polk Street, and to the California Street cable car terminus. It's situated in a primarily residential area -- we felt as though we were living in a neighbourhood rather than \"hotel row\" or a business district, which was a huge plus and gave us a much better feel for the city. We found plenty of nearby places to eat cheaply (check out Nick's Crispy Tacos, Polk @ Broadway, and The Crepe House, Polk @ Washington). No question, we'd stay here again.\n",

We have been traveling to Boston Children's for our son's complex heart condition for nearly 10 years now, but until recently we have not been fortunate enough to obtain reservations here during our stay. This hotel seemed to be very popular and availability limited. Once we experienced the Inn at Longwood, we began scheduling planned hospitalizations for our son around the hotel's room availability! We had found out first hand why it was so popular and didn't want to have to return to staying elsewhere. During our last two emergency hospital stays, the inn had no vacancies, but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room. The first time their desk clerk, Amy, (with the help of the manager, Bill Davies) managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim. Then just last week we were again faced with the \"no room at the inn\" situation and about to give up. The manager, Bill Davies, went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament. We were just about to give up late at night (after checking back frequently during the day for availability) when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us. It is so refreshing to find that there are still caring people out there who will help you when the chips are down.

As soon as you enter the hotel and make your way to the reception desk and see the vaulted ceilings and furnishings, you can feel yourself going back in time. The front desk staff is most attentive and often have people from all over the world working there. They are quick to help and guide you on any question or concern. The location is right in downtown San Diego. You can walk to most anything. Shopping, eating and site seeing can all start from this location. Restaurants abound at all prices, cuisine and ambiance. Shopping is nearby and again in different price ranges. When you step off the elevator and circle around to your room, you know you are in a very nice hotel. Each two rooms share a single \"keyed\" entrance to an anteroom. Then you enter your own room. Spacious is the word. The decor is beautiful. Everything in its right place. The bathroom is as big as you will see. Comfortable bed and heating/air-conditioning. I haven't used the hotel eating facility, because of the large number of choices nearby. I would recommend Maria's Mexican Restaurant at 1011 4th Avenue. It's a hole in the wall, but the people are very nice and the food is quite good.

No view, but the sound from the HVAC system in the courtyard provided a white-noise background and I slept like a top! Lots of towels, soap, shampoo, etc.--not the expensive spa brands, but they work just as well. The business centre in the basement has 3 working computers with web access and a monochrome laser printer, all at no charge! The fitness centre had 3 treadmills and 3 bikes in addition to a other equipment, also free. Complimentary continental breakfast has decent coffee, juice, toast and lots of other choices. Close to Penn Station, Macy's, 2 subway lines, and lots of reasonably priced Korean restaurants. If you are on a budget and/or luxury is not a must, this is the place for you!\n",

My friend and I arrived at the hotel around 8 am and the friendly woman at the counter quickly checked to see if any rooms were available for us, even though check in wasn't until much later. With a smile and enthusiasm she informed us they had a room available for us and she even called us after we got settled in to make sure we were happy with it. The staff also was very accommodating wen we asked if we could leave our luggage with them for the day after we checked out and they kindly allowed us to hang out in the \"rec\" area before we caught our bus back home.

The overall atmosphere of the hotel was much better than my prior experience of the Grant Plaza, and such a lucky deal!\n",

Luxurious cream marble baths, carpeted bedrooms, amazingly comfortable king beds. Solicitous and mannered staff, from greeters/valet at pullup in the rental car and thorough kind mannered and well trained front desk staff. Prompt service from room service, valet car pickup requests, and on premises restaurant, Ame. \" Is there anything else I can do for sir ?\" was a common question with each encounter with this hotel's staff. Stay here if you like contemporary furnishings, spectacular city views. Lobby bar and lounge is popular with locals and can get busy and noisy later in the evening. Well designed lobby and public areas, perhaps this property is not for you if you prefer traditional furnishings, though. I enjoy the complimentary coffee available in the mornings on the fourth floor by the casual restaurant and the large L shaped gym on 5. I did not use the 6th floor pool or spa, however. Prompt and thorough housekeeping staff and eager to please turn down service in the evenings, with every request met promptly and willingly. Museum of Modern Art is next door, and Metreon Center is across the street for films, Union Square and Market St. shopping just a few blocks away. My only negative observation is that the room/suite furnishings are looking slightly worn, some stains on the mohair sofa, and wood furniture looking very slightly scratched. Lovely thick towels, bathrobes, generous toiletries. Closet and drawer space is very limited however, a common design flaw among higher end contemporary hotels, I find. High speed elevators with rarely more than a few seconds wait. I love the motorized curtains and sun shades in the suite's bedrooms, although I must say the centralized touch screen telephone/command center can be frustrating and confusing to use unless you concentrate and look closely at the screen and it's functions.\n",

Shuttle leaves every 30 minutes and the hotel is about 5 minutes down the road from the hotel. Lastly there's a shopping center 5 minutes away if you need anything for your trip.\n",
      "The bad: truly hard to complain about anything regarding this fabulous hotel. The only thing I would change is the shower - there's a stationary glass wall rather than a curtain. Unfortunately you have to basically walk into the shower to turn it on... meaning even if you have lightning fast reflexes you're going to get hit with a second or two of cold water after turning the shower on. Not a deal breaker for an otherwise great hotel.\n",

We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a corner room so had a great view down the block towards Times Square - great for checking things out but far enough from the madness when you wanted quiet. Room was clean and kept that way throughout our stay by great housekeeping staff. We got great tips and \"insider information\" from the conceirges on staff during our visit. We had great times at all of their recommendations whether it be for a restaurant or sightseeing. The location was great to catch the Broadway shows we went to and to pick up the subway when we ventured further afield. \n",

I wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday with a trip to Philadelphia so that she could take in all the historic sites and great food that the city has to offer. I knew nothing about Penn’s View Inn prior to booking my reservations and knowing that my wife prefers quaint, historic, bed & breakfast lodging over four and five star any day – I wanted to give this establishment a try. Well – I am very pleased to say that not only was my wife surprised but I was very impressed also. The staff (Antonio – the Manager) personally escorted us to our room and you could tell he was very knowledge about the hotel and the surrounding area. The room was a small suite on the fifth floor (Room 508). It was perfect – from our balcony we could see the river and in the other direction we could see the steeple of Christ Church. Dinner in the hotel’s restaurant was first class – and the room service was quick and courteous. When you read this review you have to ask why should I believe this guy…well…I have stayed in numerous four and five star hotels in many major cities and in Hawaii and even as a Rewards Member of two of the major hotels I have not been this impressed with attention to service and detail. Also, the different driver’s from the limo company that I used daily for our three day get-away all had great things to say about the establishment – and they got nothing for saying it either. Nice walk to the historic sites and really great little shops only a few steps away on Market Street. Enjoy. ****One little thing extra - when we arrived at the hotel the first night my wife walked into the lobby with a bouquet that I had the driver bring to the airport...it was not in a vase...without asking...and this may seem to be a common sense thing...the lady checking us in brought a vase to my wife with a pair of scissors...little things like that is what I am talking about...when we left the beautiful bouquet was proudly displayed at the hotel's front desk...\n",

First of all, there were no normal size plates available. We had to use those little plates meant for toast. Cutlery and napkins were a luxury, and after a 10 minute wait my wife and I gave up and split the 1 set we were able to obtain. The food situation wasn't much better than the dishes, and we had to wait a good while to get sausages, eggs and potatoes. The selection of muffins was never restocked, nor was the yogurt, bread or oatmeal, so I cannot comment on these, but what little food we ate was not of good quality. \n",

The Crowne Plaza turned out to be a great hotel located on Broadway and 49th in the middle of Times Square. We stayed from May 29- June 1, 2005 and found it to be very nice. We had a king sized bed with the most comfortable mattress and the most luxuriously soft comforter (I would like to buy one for my own bed!). I was very impressed by the fact that security was always diligent about asking to see people's room keys before they allowed them to access the elevators to the rooms. The rooms were clean, we had a great view, and we were centrally located within walking distance to many attractions. I was suprised that even though we were smack in the middle of Times Square, we didn't hear a lot of outside noise (except for the occasional ambulance or police siren). I would give the hotel 4.5 stars if it weren't for the thin walls. Luckily, our next door neighbors weren't in their rooms often, but when they were, you could hear their voices clearly though the thin walls. Also, check-in was a little slow in trying to locate a room, even though we had advanced pre-paid reservations. Overall, we couldn't be more pleased for the price that we paid.

My first New York experience was staying at the Marriott Marquis, but that was when I did not have to foot the bill!! Prime location, especially when you are 19 and single (living off of mom and dad) was definately needed back then. And the Marquis was the best. But now travelling with children; security, cleanliness and budget comes first. We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We were in a great location! We could see the World Trade site from the hallway while awaiting the elevator. The HUGE discount department store 21 was very near the hotel as were the subway stations! It was very easy to catch a cab by the help of the bellman. The conceirge helped us with finding Bubby's restaurant in Tribeca. And even when it was pouring down rain, the front desk gave us nice umbrellas!! Location is everything and surprisingly the Marriott was the best location to suit our needs. We left the hotel early every morning and returned after 10 PM every evening. I felt very safe and secure. We shopped and dined all day and when it was time to retire, it was nice to return to a quiet uncrowded area to unwind. We ate the breakfast buffet in the morning, a bit pricey at $20 per person (children were half price). The spread was fantastic, though. Everything you would ever want, from fresh fruit to made to order omelets. The fitness center and pool were very nice also. The entire hotel was spotless. We stayed in the corner room with 2 queen beds and plenty of space to spread out.There was a nice bureau and a desk with a chair and a lounging chair. The beds were out of this world comfy!!! The bathroom was full sized and very euro chic. And most importantly, CLEAN!! All in all, I have not one bad thing to write about the Marriott Financial District!\n",

There did not seem to be as many choices and the food stations are way spread-out. The Asian cuisine was the highlight. Not much else that I found to be appetizing. I think the purposely lowered the prices, so people that want to spend a little more will go to one of the expensiv-o restaurants (Bourbon Steak House and Salt Water) which the entrees were around $35-$50 each. This is just my conjecture, but one FACT is the buffet quality went down from the old casino.\n",

Room service & the food delivered was all very delicious. It's expensive, but it's New York City so I expected it. I only have one bad thing to say and that is in regards to the pool attendant. She was SO lazy and would stand behind her podium reading/studying most of the time and would even let you know that's what she was up to. She had no regard for getting clean towels and two of the days I spent at the pool she ran out of towels. There was also a bit of a service issue at the pool even when it was slow.\n",

      "Text: Our family enjoyed a long weekend in Chicago and a comfortable stay at the Embassy Suites Downtown Lakefront - and appreciated being upgraded to a larger corner suite following inquiry upon arrival. Like many, we seek out Embassy Suites when traveling with the kids as you can't beat the suite rooms, free breakfasts, manager's receptions, and atrium space. There are 2 Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago very close to each other and I ultimately chose this one based on its 2008 remodel. Although nothing that follows spoiled our stay, here are my gripes having paid about $200/night: (1) The bathroom needed maintenance and housekeeping. The curved shower curtain rod was so loose that the curtain wouldn't stay closed on either end; grout along the top of the tub appeared mold-ready; floor tile never sparkled; tub faucet was loose; light bulb was out for days; toilet paper dispenser placement required you to be a contortionist to access it; and the absence of any venting fogged up the entire suite during showers leaving visible moisture everywhere. And, (2) despite the ES website touting new flatscreens in the living room areas, we had an old tube TV; (3) we waited over an hour for an extra blanket and pillow to be delivered for the kids sleeping on the pull-out sofa; (4) our food tray from room service (dirty dishes) sat out in the hall for 2 days; (5) the chlorine was too strong in the tiny pool; (6) the bar sink faucet was loose; (7) creamer packets for coffee weren't always replaced; (8) and there were never enough hand towels (there are 3 separate in-room sinks). Still, we rate ES Chicago Downtown Lakefront very good - and a little more \"attention to the details\" would have earned it excellent. (PS: Cheers to the hardworking bar staff during the nightly manager's reception!)\n",

      "Text: This is the first review I have ever written for something. And I have put this off for several months, but with enough consistent bad service, I feel it is time to share my experience with Crowne Plaza in Austin, TX. My husband has stayed at this hotel at least once a month for the past year and on many trips, I join him. Amazingly, this hotel has had some sort of problem each and every time we have stayed there. There has not been one visit that went without problems. Not one!! We are always here on business, therefore we do not get to choose the hotel. My husband's employer, through a local hospital, gets a business deal with this particular hotel and the arrangements are always made for us. Therefore, we do not get a say in where we stay, otherwise obviously we would not continue to return to this hotel. The problems we have faced have included reservation problems such as 1) not having the employer credit card info on file (reservation is always faxed in on a hotel form) and us being required to give a personal card in order to check-in, this has then caused a large freeze on our debit or credit accounts until they can get it worked out and we can have our CC company unfreeze our accounts (24-48 hrs later) 2) our reservation being for the wrong period of time (not enough nights), the wrong type of room (if we requested two beds as we did for the one trip when we brought along our son) 3) being locked out of our room because the reservation ended a day early, with all of our belongings in our room. There have also been times we have had actual room problems such as 1) ant infestation 2) no hot water 3) no air conditioning 4) no wifi....in fact there was one visit in which we moved rooms 3 times before we got into a room that had both hot water and AC, and that ended up being the room that had ants...\n",
      "We keep thinking surely this will get better but it has not. The staff generally wants to \"make things right\" and offer a key card into the executive lounge to get food or a free drink coupon for their bar. This is a nice gesture but honestly, it would be so much better if they just got it right the first time. \n",
      "I will say the staff in the executive lounge are FANTASTIC!!! And the housekeeping staff is also really great. The concierge who sometimes is in the lobby to greet guests is really nice as well. But I am not impressed at all with the front desk and reservations staff. I simply don't understand why it's so difficult to get a hotel reservation correct....at least once in 12-15 visits!!!!! I sure wish we could stay somewhere else and we have tried to get it changed. If you are coming to Austin/North Austin, go to the Embassy Suites...it's just down I-35 a bit and my husband has stayed there and loved it!\n",

We were so glad that we were able to eat in our room and not have to go out to another location and pay the same price for the same food. There always seemed to be some type of management in the entry of the hotel. They made sure that we didn't need anything and they were very friendly. They also came by and adjusted our clocks so we would be ready for the time change. The Sunday brunch at Hot Tuna was very good. It was about 16 dollars, but they had everything and that included your drink!! They also serve Starbucks in the coffee house. We called to get our luggage taken down and to check out of the room. They arrived within 3 minutes and got all of our bags. By the time we took the elevator down and turned in our room keys, our entire vehicle was packed! They put everything where it belonged!! We were so impressed. They even put our newspaper up front for us to read. They were very nice and made sure we had directions to where we were going. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a nice occasion, or everyday travel. They were very helpful when we were looking for things to do around the city too.

      "Text: I am a business traveler, so my opinion of hotels tends to be that of the most honest. We live in hotel and we are thier mostregular customers. We have high demands and we know what hotels accomodate our needs. This hotel, is one of them. I frequent NY and I have stayed at this hotel 15 times in the last 12 months. To give you an even better understanding of my loyalty I have stayed at Affinia-owned properties at least 25 times in the last 15 months. It has taken some time, but I now walk through the door, and am greeted by my name. (A nice perk) I can honestly say, that there are other hotels in othre locations that I have stayed at more friently that what I have professed at this hotel, and still, I recieve no recognition. That is how this hotel differs.\n",
      "I can honestly say, this hotel is more what you expect. If you want a hotel that is provides you with the basics, questionable cleanliness, and no flares, then this hotel is not for you. However, if you want individualized expedient service, spacious immaculate rooms ( moms: you'd feel comfortable bringing your baby here with littlefears of MRSA or E.Coli), hospitable staff, yum-a-licious room service, updated furniture, a comfortable & safe setting, ample outlets, and the coziest bed you have ever slumbered in (to the point where you even contemplate stuffing the whole bed in your luggage and running off with it)..... then this is where you belong. Their level of hospitality surmounts every other hotel you've stayed in and is notthing you would ever expect. The reason why thier motto is hospitality is because they are the best of the best. If ever you wanted to live and be treated like royalty, I would suggest you give this hotel a try. They are receptive to couples, older individuals, families, business travelers, everyone. \n",

      "There are truly no words to articulate the greatness that exists in staying at this hotel. I have stayed at places from the Hampton Inn to the 5 star hotels during my stays in New York City, and still....hands down, I’d choose here over any of those. So if you want to be treated like you deserve, I implore you to share in my affinity for Affinia.\n",

The first is the internet connection. While I did not use the room internet (for which the hotel charged $16 a day) there was a free wireless connection available (not provided by the hotel). Why some hotels don’t offer this for free while others do is just a silly nickel and dime dig. The other is plumbing noise from adjacent rooms. Although not too distracting, if you are a light sleeper you might be awakened if your neighbor has an early shower or visits the toilet during the evening.

Tub/Shower combination .There may be larger baths available in the hotel, but I have never had a room with a large bath. amenities are generously sized and are by Gilchrist and Soames.\n",

The bartender not only served it in it's traditional \"Russian copper mug\" but made their own ginger beer. It was truly impressive.

      "Text: My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $150 million renovation and the \"Chicago\" charm is being killed off in favor of \"New York-New York!!\" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. \n",
      "I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last 40 years. The last time prior to this visit was in 2004. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the 2004 visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the \"bellmen\" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.\n",
      "The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the \"We're completely sold out...\" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.\n",
      "The restaurant \"Lockwood\" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? \n",
      "For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.\n",
      "Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on 21 and then 15 is hideous! I describe at as the \"stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry\". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess!\n",
      "What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....\n",
      "Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.\n",
      "We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)\n",
      "There are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago. We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance last year and it was great. If we ever get up the nerve to come back to Chicago, that's where we'll be staying.\n",

The location was great (only a few blocks from Times Square one way, a couple blocks to Central Park the other way and easy subway access. The stay started out wonderfully. We had booked a room on the executive level (top floors) which was a great move. It only cost a little bit more, but it is well worth it. There is a separate check in on the top floor with absolutely no wait. We were able to get early check in which was very convienent. The physical hotel itself was nice, nothing outrageous but nice. In the evening they served complimentary appetizers/fresh fruit/etc which were very good and in the mornings you had continental breakfast. When we went to check out the staff kindly offered us a very late check out (5:00 PM rather than noon). This was OUTSTANDING because all I was asking for was to check our bags with the bell desk because our flight was not leaving until the afternoon and our original plan was to do some more sight seeing during the day. It was a very rainy day so without us even asking for it they offered us this late checkout at no extra charge since we would be pretty misarable walking around the city in the rain. The concierge was also EXTREMELY friendly and helpful. This was a perfect stay and would highly recommend and if you do stay here, I would also advise the upgrade to executive level.\n",

I asked about paying a fee for an upgrade, and he quickly accommodated my request with a reasonable fee. I told him that my girlfriends and I were meeting in Charlotte to enjoy life, spend time together, and watch the football game that night on TV (and mentioned we wanted to see Virginia Tech win). I had a spa appointment to get things started, so he suggested he have someone deliver my bags to the suite so I could start enjoying the spa. Excellent plan, Frankie. :)\n",

There is a full body shower, at least one regular shower, some quiet areas, a steam room and a sauna room. The whole area was spotless, and the attendants were available when needed but not intrusive. (They weren't hovering around the spa area all the time (which can be awkward if one is partially dressed and/or make one feel rushed to leave), but there was always help at available at the very close-by front desk.) When I booked the appointment, the attendant had mistakenly left me on hold for a really long time, so when I checked in, she gave me a small gift to apologize (which was not needed but very kind of her to do). My friends and I met in the spa and spent a lot of time just chilling out, which we sorely needed. One of my friends also had a massage and gave it a thumbs up.\n",

The bathroom was huge and featured rich marble decor with a shower with a glass door, a tub, and a toilet room. My friends and I felt like celebrities -- it was that VIP.

      "We ended up having drinks and some light food downstairs at the bar; it was a great scene for people watching and relaxing, and it was pretty hopping even for a weekday (it was Thursday night). The appetizer specials are reasonably priced. We watched the Hokies start the game on the TV at the bar, then went in the restaurant for dinner, where we could continue to watch the game and eat. The food there was quite good and service was excellent. \n",

The staff were never too busy to help us and always polite, there was no problems with the lifts, though I can see how there could be if its very busy and you can get to most places on foot or just a short Subway ride.The aircon unit was a little noisy, but worked well as a heater. so overall we have no compliants about our stay and can only assume that the negative feedback on this site, is by people who maybe expect too much for their money, in a major city. The restuarant attached to the hotel was good for breakfast and the owners, Al and his son Vinnie ,offered us a 20% discount on dinner, but we did not have time to take up the offer this trip. We will stay at this hotel again on our next trip and can only give it a thumbs up.\n",

We are always skeptical when we read reviews and so that is why I decided that I needed to provide input on this hotel because we had a very positive experience. First of all, the hotel is a price value considering it is within walking distance to the cruise ships, restaurants, the ocean, etc etc. The rooms are very nice and well maintained. The staff is excellent. Their shuttle service is VERY accommodating and the breakfast buffet is \"yummie\". Not only did the staff go out of their way for us during our stay but they allowed us to store our luggage on our return from the cruise week. Our flight didn't leave San Diego until 6PM. We got off the cruise ship around 9:30 am and the hotel picked us up, stored our luggage while we toured San Diego for the day, and then drove us to the airport. We were very impressed and will DEFINITELY stay there again when we return to San Diego. P.S. Yes the train does come through the area but it really isn't as bad as some have reported in the reviews. We were on vacation and a little noise from a train wasn't going to bother us. The positive to this is that you can go all over San Diego from the train shuttle.\n",

We didn't know what to expect of the room before we came, having read many reviews that the rooms were small, but ours was a great size for the two of us. If you want a bigger room, you can't expect to pay for a standard queen and get a large suite.\n",

When we got the room key and saw that the room was right there in the lobby area, facing the street, we asked for another room. I asked if there were other rooms for us to choose from; the flat answer was \"no, all the rooms are booked\" (but that wasn't true--as we later heard at 1:00 a.m. when a passerby was able to book a room on the spot.The room was located on the 2nd floor--very noisy, noisy, noisy---facing the street, listening to any and all conversations outside the hotel, as well as in the lobby.

Union Square, Market St. and the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market are within walking distance. The hotel deserves high praise for its location, design, style, technology, amenities and especially its service. \n",
      "The St. Regis and Luxury Collection are the Starwood group's high end chains. Having stayed 3 times at the wonderful St. Regis New York and having visited the St. Regis Monarch Beach CA and Washington DC, I was looking forward to my stay here, and at a convention group rate to boot.\n",
      "The hotel is about 2 years old and located on the corner of Mission and 3rd. Directly on the corner, the facade of a historic 8 story building was preserved and a high rise tower was integrated behind, beside and above it, on what once was a parking lot. The hotel occupies the first 20 floors of the tower; the top 20 or so floors are St. Regis residences. Within the older building are the hotel's 2 restaurants--Ame (dinner) on the first floor and Vitrine (breakfast and lunch) on the 4th--as well as the 2 level spa and offices. There is a landscaped terrace on the roof and another larger terrace on the 4th floor which was tented for an outdoor dinner party when I was there. The lobby in the newer building is compact but stylish and well-designed. A design feature of rose petals is echoed throughout the public areas.\n",
      "Our convention rate was for the superior room category on the lower floors (5-8), so I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded to a deluxe room--same size but on a higher floor (15). I also was able to check in early. My room looked similar to the photos posted on 1/1/06 by a TripAdvisor member from Sunnyvale CA. My room faced west with a view of Yerba Buena Gardens, Moscone and points beyond. The east facing rooms face the Bay, but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the Financial District.\n",
      "The room itself was not too large but contemporary and sleek. The entry foyer had a table, wooden floor sculpture and leather walls. There was another wood wall hanging in the bedroom. The bedside table held the St. Regis signature phone/computer that can control the thermostat, lights, window shades, alarm clock, etc. via a touch screen. There were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair, but no chaise lounge or \"fainting chair\" as seen on the hotel web site. There was a large marble window ledge--great for counter space. One wall held the 42\" flat screen TV (which did not swivel) and 3 recessed doors--one was a too small closet (only about 2 feet of space), another held a safe, fax machine (out of ink) and 3 drawers, the third held the minibar and fridge and DVD/CD player. The spacious bath had an enclosed WC, a tub that opened onto the bedroom, a separate shower stall with marble bench, rain head plus hand-held head. There was a 2nd flat screen TV, but only one sink. In the room and bath, there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels.\n",
      "Technological glitches included: 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired (batteries?). With the phone/computer, the party I was speaking to occasionally could not hear me, though I could hear them. The hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when I requested a wake-up call and the operator called twice but could not hear me, so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door. Alas, the phone still was acting up on check out day. \n",
      "Overall service was top notch--quick, courteous and professional--especially the front desk and housekeeping. The problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies. The doormen were not so attentive--often talking with the valets. No one helped me when I walked up with my luggage when first checking in. Some of the concierge staff, while helpful, were a bit aloof. I believe all the St. Regis' offer Butler Service. In New York this is quite formal, but seems less so here. One Butler I spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessional--when she couldn't answer my question, she yelled/asked another employee without putting me on hold, so I could hear every thing.\n",
      "The public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff, and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool, also open 24 hours. The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side. The \"Business Center\" consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators. This may be a temporary location.\n",
      "Regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviews--yes you can hear them, but I imagine the other nearby hotels--W, Four Seasons, Westin, Marriott--can as well.\n",
      "I have stayed at a few other high-end hotels here--the Ritz Carlton, Campton Place, the Palace. I would like to one day try the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental, but for now the St. Regis is my favourite San Francisco hotel.\n",

We had a room with Bay view, I believe almost all rooms do. The inside of the hotel, with it's open lobby and illuminated elevators, is particularly impressive. The staff is great in all respects. When a small package I had ordered hadn't come in with the mail in time before we left, Pepe from the mail room went out of his way to have it forwarded by mail to our next Hyatt stay in San Diego. We didn't even get charged for that allthough I had authorized a charge. We will be back for sure! \n",

The bathrooms are small, but how big does a bathroom need to be?

We settled for free parking and no charge for our roll-away which was less hassle, but not as much of a discount as we could have received. The kitchen was also not as well stocked as I expected.

      "Text: My husband and I just returned from six nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We asked for a quiet location and didn't care about a view, and were given room 701, a junior suite that faces the side of the McDonald's building next door. It was well protected from neighboring room noise (it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet) and fairly protected from street noise, but more about that in a minute. The room was very large and clean, the bed and chairs comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people (though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries). The bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan, as it has no vent or window, and a couple of days when I attempted to shower around noon I had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water (this didn't happen when showering earlier). The kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters, as we did not like the in-room Puck's filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee. The Azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar, including items such as stuffed tofu, sesame noodles, and seafood, a hot foods bar, and many essentials such as boxed cereal, baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks, so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner. A table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk, and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both, but we only had the desk.\n",
      "I had read some reviewers' comments about rooms being too hot, and they were right. In fact, the entire hotel is overheated, and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40-degree air at all times, including at night. Fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units, which created a nice white noise for sleeping. Unfortunately, though, the smell of McDonald's often wafted in. A fan-only setting on the heating/AC unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy, but the only option at this time of year was hot air, because the hotel hadn't yet switched over to AC. We're lucky that we didn't arrive later in spring, because I can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there! Also, there were no screens on the windows, so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open.\n",
      "I do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators: Stay on a lower floor and take the stairs! We were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time, though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing, especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats.\n",
      "The second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed, and has two computers with Internet access for guests. The trouble is, there's no regulation of usage, so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other like-minded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends. Her mother finally told her to get off--but then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email! The other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to Flickr, apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs. The staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area.\n",

The rooms were very large, bathroom average with shower but more than adequate, very quiet with lots of windows and 2 flat screen Tv's. The location only a few blocks from Grand Central Station was very convenient (unless you're adverse to walking a little bit). We took the express bus from JFK which drops you off at Grand Central but picked us up at the hotel on the way back for $24 RT each. We found walking the best way to really see the city but also used the subways a lot to go further distances. There's a really convenient grocery store (D'Agostinos) and wine store just a block away and the nice pantry came in handy for storing fruit & juice for a quick snack in the morning and wine/beer for the late evening after being out all day. We had one dinner at \"Rare\" and the food was well prepared, service was efficient and price was about what one would expect in that locale. The breakfast prices were a bit high so we ate at the Deli down the street and a really nice restaurant under the bridge near Grand Central Station. \"Duke's\" around the corner was also good for an inexpensive dinner. \"Veselka's' was recommended for an authentic Ukrainian meal and it didn't disappoint -------in the East Village and lots of local color, specialites were blintzes, goulash, beef strogonoff, etc. The housekeeping and front desk staff were very pleasant and efficient and we would stay there again in a hearbeat.\n",

It's just a few days before my birthday and when I entered the room I had 4 chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champagne and a birthday card signed by numerous staff members waiting for me.

      "Text: Just got back, this hotel was the worst place I have ever experienced, and I was prepared after booking that it was bad, but this really shocked me. Even the cockroaches were checking out!! It's such a shame, because this hotel is rich with history, but in desperate need of TLC. I was moved 3 times because I just could not stay in the allocated room, the first was on the 8th floor and it really was the most disgusting thing I have seen. I went back to reception and the manager who must have heard it all before so was most unhelpful did give me another room which I thought was something from a horror movie. The paint was chipping off the walls, the bathroom had urine stains on the toilet seat, the curtains were non-existant, and then I did the ultimate. I checked under the sheets and mattress, and yes, you guessed it BED BUGS....By now, it was 12am and I was exhausted, so I slept fully clothes, even with my shoes on on top of the bed, using my coat to buffer the contact with the duvet, and moved out the next morning. This room was on the 2nd floor, which resembled a youth hostel with all the college kids hanging around, although even they were complaining! The next morning, I went back to reception and they moved me to the Penn Club Executive room on 13th floor, which was marginally better, in terms of the room being painted and the furniture not looking like it was found in the garbage. The maid even gave my room an extra clean, and the benefits of this room was the complimentary breakfast, which was a bonus, but served in the smallest room ever, so it was a cramped and rushed experience in the morning. \n",
      "The reason why I do not believe this hotel will spend $$$ to refurb is because it was full the entire week, so why spend $$$ when people are staying. Yes, location is a +, but I suggest stay in Soho at a small boutique hotel and really get a comfortable enjoyable stay. THis hotel is a stain on NYC and it should be ashamed to be standing amongst the great city, and I wonder how much repeat business they get so my advice is do not stay, find somewhere else and hopefully the more bad reviews and reduced business they get, will encourage the management to sort this place out. \n",
      "If you do stay, do not accept the first room allocated, and make sure you check for bed bugs, because they are still there. But staying here will negatively impact your stay in NYC, and that is the real shame of this place.\n",

All the staff were very polite although I did find their accents quite hard to understand and I think they thought the same of me. We were escorted to the escalators and once we got to our room (which was on the 23rd floor) we found an amazing room with a bottle of champagne and a welcome card from all the staff. The bed was gorgeous, and just as comfortable as it looked. The bathroom was huge and it had a shower big enough for 2 (ooh errr!) and a separate bath, also loads of free goodies and fresh flowers.\n",

      "Text: I have stayed at this hotel several times, alone, with family, and with friends, and have mixed feelings. First of all the rooms are much prettier than the Blue Seas down the street but I wouldn't say the beds are more comfortable. It took me about 30 minutes just to find the closet behing the mirror. The rooms come with a desk with a dataport and microwave and frig. However, the Blue Seas also has these things not to mention free wireless internet. The main problem with this hotel for about the last year and a half is the construction of the new lifeguard tower right at the end of the street that the hotel is situated on. Since their parking is underneath the hotel, all the construction made it very difficult to get in and out of the parking garage. The one plus about their parking is that it is free whereas the BW Blue Sea Lodge right down the street in Mission Beach charges $6 or $7 a night for their parking and they have underground and outside parking. In Pacific Beach, however, it doesn't matter where you stay, all parking places are very tiny and now even more so with the rage for SUVs. Anyway, the pool is not as large as the one at the Pacific Terrace or the Blue Sea, but it is warm, and the jacuzzi is nice. However, their pool area closes at 10. Well, they say it closes at 10pm. The last time I stayed at this hotel, there were several of us in the jacuzzi having a pleasant conversation, enjoying the evening. At about 9pm/9:15, management shut off the jacuzzi. Then at around 9:30/9:45, they shut the lights off in the pool area. I couldn't believe it. We had been looking forward to using the pool area all day at a time when there would be less children, and they closed it early. When we complained, the security guard person became very rude and asked us to leave!! Now, this hotel admittedly has a beautiful view of the beach and the ocean, but just like every other property in Pacific Beach or Mission Beach you do have the problem of homeless people and once in a while a drunk causing trouble right outside your windown on the boardwalk. But that comes with the territory. This is a big city, and there are homeless people who live down on the beach, and it is a college party town so there will be drunks. But I think the sound of the ocean at night and the proximity to the beach makes up for most of it. I never feel unsafe in Pacific Beach. I just use good judgment. At any rate, I have had problems with this hotel with billing. I have never gotten a straight answer from the front desk on whether or not 800 number calls are free or charged. Sometimes they are free and sometimes not. Also, I had a problem with the hotel releasing the hold they had on my credit card after the charge had already come through. I had to make several calls to the hotel after I got home from my trip, and was sassed by an employee over the phone and told I should just wait. Well, I called again a few days later and complained, and miraculously the hold was finally released. The Blue Sea Lodge and the Ocean Park Inn charge about the same for their room rates and there are a lot of pros and cons of both properties, but after the incident at the pool, I don't think I'll stay there again. During one of my stays at this hotel, my friend, who walks with a cane, asked if she could have a room close to the elevators. They put her in the last room at the end of the hall in the wing on the other side of the pool, as far from the elevators as she could get. When she asked if they would move her, they told her there was nothing they could do about it. Well, it happened to me the next time I stayed there with family, and I immediately called the desk and insisted they move us, which they did. So sometimes they are accomodating and sometimes there are not. I have to admit this property is in much better repair that the Blue Sea, and I have been there many times, twice when the pool was shut down, and once when the elevator was broken. I have even considered staying at the Pacific Terrace, but for much the same situation, they charge about double, so I have put up with the situations at these two properties. Again, even though the rooms are nicer at the OPI than at the BSL, I probably will not stay at this hotel again and will return to the BSL where I am treated better and they have warm chocolate chip cookies waiting for me at my arrival!!!!! Also, at the BSL, if the room is not what you want, they will work with you until you find just the perfect room. One time, they gave me about 6 keys and told me to go check them out and pick the one I wanted. How's that for accomodating. Another reason why I would choose that hotel over the OPI. Just remember, none of these properties are the Ritz Carlton. They are in a tourist/resort town and get heavy traffic and heavy abuse!!!!!!!\n",

Our room was always cleaned beautifully, and the staff in the restaurant during breakfast was wonderful. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows.

Hailing a taxi from outside the hotel wasn't difficult and there's a subway station right beside it. \n",
      "My room on the 35th floor was quiet and had a view north up 6th Avenue and over Bryant Park. It had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in - no exaggeration. The bathroom was small but very clean and nicely appointed; shower was excellent and there was also a bath. The room had a safe, an ironing board and a \"proper\" iron. There's a laundry in the basement which costs a dollar per wash and per dry - washing powder's available free from the front desk. The dry cleaning service was good - same day delivery and the prices weren't bad. Broadband internet access was available by wireless but could be a bit slow. My only issue with the room would be that it was very stuffy; there was no way to open the window further than a few centimetres, so getting fresh air in was a bit difficult. \n",
      "There was a kitchenette with a huge fridge and a dishwasher; these were useful but I could have done with a \"hob\" or ring for saucepans - I hadn't been made aware that this was available on request. There's a 24-hour deli on the corner of the block next to the hotel. You can also get hot snacks at the hotel bar on the second floor; it's tiny but nice and has a pool table. There's a \"hospitality hour\" in the evenings from Mon-Thurs, where snacks, soup, salad and so on are served to guests. Breakfast is really rather good - selection of hot food like sausages, bacon, potatoes, French toast, waffles, pancakes, oatmeal and so on (skip the eggs as they were nasty!), as well as pastries, bread, cheese and fruit. I'd advise getting down to breakast as early as you can as it gets a bit hectic after 8.30, particularly on weekends. \n",
      "As other reviewers have pointed out, the single biggest problem the hotel has is its elevator system. Getting a lift in either direction between 8.30 and 10.30 was very difficult - I waited up to ten minutes on occasion. It appeared that some of the lifts weren't even in service as it seemed to be the same two that were always in use at breakfast time.\n",
      "Front desk service on arrival and during the stay was fine; however on departure I encountered some problems. There was absolutely no flexibility as regards check-out times; I requested checkout of 2pm but was told I had to be out by 11.30 at the latest or else I'd have to pay for another half-day. This despite the fact that we had paid for thirty nights already! Also, the manners of the male concierge left a lot to be desired; quite at odds with any other hotel concierge I've dealt with. The doormen/porters were pleasant and polite. \n",
      "All in all it was a nice stay - if the Residence Inn irons out those few wrinkles in its service I've no doubt it'll get more five-star ratings from those on prolonged stays.\n",

From the minute I arrived, the valet was ready to assist with my car, as was the bellman which was definitely needed when on the road for two weeks and with three girls traveling this time around - needless to say we had lots of luggage. I was impressed by the friendly and accomodating service right from the start. The lobby was beautiful and screamed relaxing! The check in was flawless and up to the room we went. Fast elevator with a british accent welcomed me to my floor. Opened the door to the room and wow was I and my travel mates impressed. Coffee is a must for me so the first I noticed was the upgraded coffee machine with real mugs and real creamer (not powdered)! The room was furnished lovely - fantastic for us ladies - bright, cheery and in the colour of the season - orange. The room was oversized, extremely clean and exactly what I had hoped for. Need I say, the beds were terrific and rather than enjoying the night out, we decided to stay in! Also loved waking up to the spacious bathroom and huge shower area. We checked out the 9th floor bar as everyone speaks of; enjoyed the view, service and fire box, which kept us warm which made us again think as to whether we should be going out. Wine selection was definitely enjoyed as was again the staff. We did eventually venture out, and found very popular hot spots all within walking distance to the car. Each day we throughly enjoyed mainly because of this fabulous hotel and outstanding service always with a smile and ready to please. Darren at the hotel provided us great tips for places to visit and see, which really made our visit and overall experience. He was as they say the icing on the cake! Sadly our visit had to come to an end, and Im ready to start packing for a new trip. I can only hope that I have the level of service and quality of standards that I experienced at this Indigo...and I can only hope! I wish I was going back to San Diego. What a lovely and fun city!

I decide to take a swim in the pool that was on the 27th floor, the view which is ranked as 1 of the top 5 pool views in New York, certainly lived up to it. It was totally amazing. We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot say if the food was good, but that was because there was so much to eat and drink locally.

      "Overall this is a generally good Hilton property. It is apparently a convention hotel with most travelers on business during the week. We got an unpublished fare for this hotel, so the value was good overall. However, the parking was expensive since the hotel isn't centrally located. The other hotels (like the one next door) have free parking, so paying nearly $20 per night for self-parking seemed absurd. Nothing is within walking distance, so a rental car is a must.\n",

The hotel was offering a credit (read: discount!) of $100 per night for guests who stayed a minimum of two nights. Because we planned to drive from Indianapolis after work on Friday anyway, it was perfect: the luxury of the Ritz-Carlton for a room rate of about $25 a night more than we would have spent on a much more modest hotel at the other end of the Magnificent Mile.\n",
      "The service was impeccable. From the bellman who greeted us and took our luggage to our room to the desk clerks, the concierge, and room service attendants, everything was top-flight. \n",

      "Our room, 2222, was a Deluxe room and included a king bed, easy chair, desk, big-screen TV, huge closet, and a minibar. The room faced south with what real estate agents would describe as a “peek view” of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier, but had shades and curtains that kept the morning sun at bay until we were ready to greet it.\n",

It was delivered within 1/2 hour of our call and was delicious!\n",

Chicago is also home to a number of wonderful dining spots, many are within easy walking distance of the Ritz-Carlton. While my wife and I thoroughly enjoy fine food and aren’t hesitant about paying for it, some of the trendier spots in the area seemed to smack of a “popularity premium,” so we asked one of the concierge staff for other recommendations. The concierge, a member of Les Clef d’Or, recommended a new Mexican restaurant that opened on Kinzie Street in September, just a short cab ride from the hotel. \n",
      "There’s a lot to do in Chicago, from shopping and sightseeing when the weather is good to a broad range of museums, theatres, and other indoor attractions when the weather is bad. I highly recommend considering The Ritz-Carlton as your base of operations, no matter what the weather!\n",

Prior to the visit I had emailed the hotel to ensure we were getting a king bed, as one of our goals was getting a good night sleep (we have a toddler at home and another coming soon). The concierge emailed me back to see if there was anything else they could do to make our stay special. The gesture was much appreciated, as was the upgrade to a suite when we checked in. The room was fantastic, with a large sitting and dining area adjacent to the bedroom and bathroom. The color scheme was white with modern décor, definitely a contrast from other hotels where we’ve stayed in Boston. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very chic. Note that if you are looking to take a bath, you may be out of luck, as our room only had a stand-up shower – not sure if any other rooms have a tub. The room was matched by the food from the restaurant, Woodward. Our quick lunch of squash flatbread and mixed nuts hit the spot, and I sampled some of their funky cocktails (the New Orleans Sazerac is addictive). But we were holding out for breakfast and the hash menu. We had the duck and sweet potato hash and the ham and cheese omelet delivered to the room and it did not disappoint.

      "The room had a wrap-around view as noted, and there was a nice Hudson view from the bathroom as well. Others have commented on the lack of shelf space but this was not a problem for me. There was a mobile etegere for additional storage, which should accommodate most guests' toiletries.\n",

      "Text: In town for a wedding and weary from a day of missed flights from the east coast, our first contact at the Huntington was the professional and friendly doorman and bell staff. Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the \"Big 4\" railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the \"Big Four\" Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a \"special occasion\" venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper. Even as we were leaving at 3:30 am to catch our flight back home!\n",

I find the SpringHill accommodations are really not suites, but large rooms and this property would be the same.

They were always replacing offerings and constantly cleaning. Even the manager got in the act when the place was busy. My benchmark is the cleanliness of the liquid waffle machine ( a gooey concoction found these days in most complimentary breakfast offerings) - normally a mess at most hotels.

While I did not pay for my stay, I'm writing this review with the mindest of how I would view this hotel if I had actually paid for the room based on the current prices listed on their website. (which is currently listed at $195 for a Superior King for the month of December 2010)\n",

      "My room was a Superior King and was very spacious and full of all kinds of unique and helpful items that set this hotel apart from other hotels I've stayed at in this class. For starters, it's stocked with a great selection of amazing Kiehls bath products. They also have a towel warmer, hair dryer, iron, safe, and an empty fridge, so you can go out and buy your own things and keep them cold. Many hotels overstock the mini bar, so you can't really use the fridge for anything you might want to buy on your own. In my opinion, this was better and if I really needed anything else they have 24 hour room service. \n",

(One thing that they didn't have in the room that I felt would be a nice addition is a DVD player, but perhaps that will come in the future.)\n",

Plenty of space for two guests to store clothes. \n",

But what makes this a GREAT hotel is; the staff! They are SO professional at what they do. Everyone from the concierge to the servers to the housekeepers went way above my expectations. We were treated like royalty and we will definately be back. The 27th floor houses the \"Roof\", a bar and restaraunt with retractable a roof and walls. This place is so much fun, with amazing views and ambiance.\n",

      "Text: My husband and I have stayed all over the city with our children and without (2 girls 7 & 9). Comparing the Marriott East side to the Hilton on 6th or the W in times square it's easy to give this hotel a rave review. We were just their from Oct 6-9. When we arrive we are always greeting with smiles and hello's. The hotel guest relations coordinator Kenda remembers us everytime we go (about 3 times a year). This particular stay we reserved a Jr Suite with a pull out sofa for our children. When we got to the 6th floor room it smelled of smoke (non-smoking hotel) and the tub was clogged. I called down to the at your service desk and requested a change of rooms due to the fact of an asthmatic child. We were not given the same room but instead the Ambabassador Suite on the 33rd floor. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. My profile with Marriott states that I have an asthmatic child, however I don't feel that this is why I was switched to such a large suite. I believe it is the relations that the staff tries to keep with it's guest. I have never experienced a rude employee at this hotel. Having stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 5 I find that quite amazing. Not sure if everyone knows this, but JW Marriott is the parent company for the Ritz Carlton. As a frequent guest of the Ritz in Boston as well as the Ritz Beach Resort in Naples FL. It is easy to compare this category 7 Marriott to the Ritz. For anyone who expects a LARGE hotel room in NYC should do somemore research, most that I've stayed in have been quite small. I'm sure do to the fact that the city is so populated. Paying over $500 a night was completely fine for what we got (even if our room hadn't changed) Location, just blocks from the best shopping and sites in NYC. The easy highway access and the fact that you are in such a large city and yet at this hotel you get the feel that you are in a neighborhood. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy New York!!!!\n",

Nina, the woman on duty, commented on a crown shaped pendant I was wearing. I told her it was a gift from my husband and that I am the queen of our home. She laughed and said that she is the queen of the Lenox. In fact they call her QB (queen bee) for short. We chatted a bit more and my husband and I headed for a quick lunch at her recommendation of Pappa Razzi for some carbo loading. (excellent) We went back to the room and Nina appeared with a basket of goodies (power bars, etc) and a giant helium balloon. It was a bumble bee of course! How special and unbelievable! I have never had such a thoughtful gesture made by a complete stranger. There is no need to look further in Boston than the Lenox.

      "I took the advice of a fellow Trip Advisor member to forego the hotel parkade & save ½ of the parking costs by utilizing the Westin Building parkade which is linked to the hotel by a walkway. As we unloaded the luggage from the car, my son & I went looking for a luggage cart in which to transport our bags to the hotel room. We found one at the end of the walkway on the 2nd floor of the hotel near the meeting rooms. We took the cart back to where our car was parked, where we loaded up our luggage & proceeded to the front desk to register. \n",
      "While I was checking into the hotel, my wife was approached by a bell attendant who told her that she could not use this cart. When she responded that it was left in the upstairs lobby near the walkway, the attendant then told her in front of other hotel guests the cart was his responsibility and that she should not have taken it and that he could get in trouble with his boss . My wife responded that maybe the hotel should have put a sign on it telling patrons to not use the luggage carts. The attendant then insisted that he bring our luggage up to the room. \n",
      "Unaware of the encounter that transpired, I proceeded to the hotel room along with my family, the bell attendant and our luggage. After he left, my wife then told me the story of what had happened. It reminded me of a scene from the English comedy “Faulty Towers”. \n",
      "Since we were on a bit of a schedule, I chose to wait until I returned home to comment on this experience rather than make a formal complaint. I felt sorry for the fellow, as he appeared \"stressed out\" during my brief encounter with him.\n",

We never had to wait and they were spotlessly clean, with plenty of hot water.\n",
      "A few reviews mention the noise in the pod hotel, so we went armed with ear plugs. I think you have to accept that New York is a noisy city, we were on the 9th floor and you can hear the street noise if you have your window open, with the window closed I had no problems sleeping and our room came with air con to keep us cool. Yes, the doors do slam if you let them, but I cant say that this is a reason not to stay here.\n",
      "The staff were friendly and very helpful, there are maps and tourist information/advice available from reception, they will also store your bags and arrange transport to the airport if needed. They have a lovely lobby and outside patio area in which they have just started to provide breakfast for guests. The general facilities are great, ipod doc, tv's and free internet access for every room, you couldnt really ask for much more - even the location is great, its close to the MoMa, Top of the Rock, 5th Ave shops and a subway.\n",

      "I highly expected the cold, \"Priceline\" treatment when I walked up to the desk at 11am on a Thursday to check-in. I am not sure if I just got a nice desk clerk or my Hilton Gold HHonors card did the trick, but I was given a room in Tower 1 on the 37th floor, access to the Executive Level, and free breakfast for both days. She even added my HHonors account # to the reservation (which they are not supposed to do for Priceline stays).\n",
      "The room was small, but had a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Everything was clean, but room service was spotty. The first night we received turn down service, but the second night we did not. We were given complimentary waters from the mini-bar, but they never replenished the stock. Everything else was fine with housekeeping.\n",
      "For breakfast we choose the restaurant on the lobby level rather than the continental on the Excecutive Level. The buffet which you may choose instead of a menu item was above-average and opens at 6am. The \"finger foods\" offering on the Executive Level from 5 - 7pm was not as good as the views from that level. Everything tasted like frozen food and the booze was cash bar. Waters and sodas were free and were great to take back to the room for later.\n",
      "I am not sure if access to the Execututive Level is actually controlled because there were a ton of people up there, no checks at the door, and a ton of children. Regardless, it was a nice place to fill up on snacks before heading out to dinner.\n",
      "We did not use the pool, but we checked it out and it was very small and basically sat in-between the towers...not a very appealing environment. The fitness center is small, but I used some of the equipment and was pleased.\n",
      "One disconcerning experience was with the Bell Desk. We needed to pickup our rental car, so we asked to leave our bags for an hour or so after we checked out to save time. We handed over the bags, got our claim tickets and you could tell this guy wanted a tip already. In my experience it is customary to tip after you retrieve your bags, not upon dropping them off. Perhaps the normal business clientel throws around money more than we do, but what did he do for a tip...Put a ticket on my bags?\n",
      "Anyway, after we got the car, we went inside to get the bags, gave our tickets and requested a cart. This same guy points to our bags, say get them yourself and told us to put them on the cart. At this point, another person at the Bell Desk offered to help; he took the bags to the car and put them in the trunk for us. He got the tip, not the grinch who told us to do it ourselves.\n",
      "As for homeless people being reported right outside the doors of the hotel: we did not experience this. However, if you walk around town you will encounter many. For those of you who have spent time in Manhattan, this is not an issue. For those of you from small towns, I guess it can be unpleasant. Although I was unphased by homeless, there appears to be a large population of mentally ill, homeless people evidenced by screaming, talking to themselves, and in one case, a nude woman all within walking distance of the Hotel (Right across from Hotel Adagio and Cortez restaurant).\n",
      "Every city has homeless, so if it really bothers you perhaps you should not walk around at night? One reviewer suggested giving the homeless money. I am not sure I agree with this and many expect more if you give a little. Again, that comes from growing up around Manhattan. To each their own I guess.\n",
      "One thing I am sure of is that you should not let a few homeless citizens take away from the otherwise great loaction of this hotel. A few blocks from BART, major bus stop hubs, streetcars and trolleys. I recommend this for your first stay in San Francisco since it really is at the center of it all.\n",

      "Text: I had a free night at any Hyatt from a promotion during the spring, so I used it for a one-night stay on a college visit to Chicago with my teenage son. We were able to confirm only a two twin bed room, but were advised to request two doubles at check-in. We arrived early around 9am, expecting to check our luggage. Despite being sold out on doubles, they checked for two rooms, both with doubles, and said we could check in soon. After about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby; when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready. We went to the room, which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan down the street. Two double beds, a huge bathroom with two sinks, a separate toilet room, an oversized bathtub with a hand-held shower head, and a separate shower room with a rain-type wall mounted shower about 8' up and a separate hand-held. The door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed. I couldn't believe that we had been given a two-room suite, so I called the front desk to check. I was put on hold but got no response so I called back after a few minutes. They first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room, but when I explained that I was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that I had reserved only one room. I locked the connecting doors myself.\n",
      "The room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting. Flat screen TV, i-pod dock, one robe (but two pairs of slippers) in the closet, two toothbrushes and toothpaste, iron, ironing board, shoeshine machine, hairdryer, safe, etc. Minibar, jars of nuts (3 kinds), bottles of imported sparking water, basket of apples. I assume that only the apples were complimentary though. (the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turn-down service -- I guess they really wanted us to buy them.) Extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each, a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman, glass desk with chair, and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate. Complimentary internet access -- wired and wireless, although the latter worked for my son, it didn't for me, There was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked \"internet cable\" in one of the drawers.\n",
      "We checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel. I asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure, no problem. We didn't need to keep our keys because there was open access. We returned around 4:30 pm and went to the pool. Locker room had full-sized lockers stocked with robes and slippers; towels were piles on a rack. Keys were in the unused lockers. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, shaving cream, razors, etc. all available. Two shower rooms, one equipped for handicapped. Large steam room. Three or four lane lap pool, with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters. Small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day. We went to the airport and arrived home late, tired and relaxed. Our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip.\n",
      "I didn't rate value because our room was complimentary. We really appreciated not being treated like second class citizens in any way -- the service was first rate from everyone we encountered. My only two admittedly minor suggestions would be to replace the towels with more fluffy ones -- the ones we had were somewhat thin -- and to add a mirror in the bedroom -- the only mirrors were in the bathroom.\n",
      "My son's telling me that I did a great job in selecting this hotel -- priceless.\n",

      "Text: We've now stayed at all 3 Embassy suites in DC and can recommend all of them. This one was the most recent. I was a little worried because this one is on the eastern side of town which is considered the \"edge\" by some people. We had no problems and this location is actually very close to the touristy stuff. The breakfast is excellent (which is typical for ES) and free drinks at happy hour are hard to beat. Seriously, those to things probably save you 25-35 bucks a day for each person staying (breakfast and cocktails are not cheap in cities). The breakfast selections were numerous...from hard-boiled eggs, yogurt and fruit to a full hot breakfast buffet along with made-to-order omelets. We also thought that every employee was polite and helpful. The valet parking was expensive but that's just kinda the way cities are, i guess. Can't figure a way around it. The room itself was spacious enough that when you hang out there for a while you don't have that trapped feeling. Also, they're all suites. So if one person wants to go to bed and the other wants to watch ESPN for a while, it's fine. Room was clean, had a fridge, microwave, couch, chairs, table and chairs, etc. Only downside was you could hear some noise from adjoining rooms such as running water, doors closing...wasn't terrible but the plumbing noises were pronounced. The only other thing I wish they had was some type of noisemaker; like a bathroom fan, wall fan, or something. It would help mask the noises of the city on the street below. i don't know why more hotels don't offer this feature. They need to realize that people use fans for things other than ventilation. And lastly, we've found that on weekends you can get a room at these embassy suites for two nights for about the same price as one night. Don't know why, but that's a hard deal to beat.\n",

Situated just outside of Union Square, the hotel is in a great spot for walking to many restaurants, bars, and shops. As well, the cable car is a short block away. Reception was friendly with home baked cookies and a bowl of fruit in the lobby. Complimentary water and soft drinks were also readily available. We arrived in time for the afternoon wine and hors d'oeuvre which were lovely. Our first room was acceptable, although tiny. We stayed the first night, but because we were carrying extra luggage to attend a wedding, we did not have enough space and requested a room change. \n",

The trolley stopped behind our hotel and we loved riding down to Beale St and sight seeing on the trolley. We were within walking distance to a great cafe recommended by the staff, the Blue Plate, and enjoyed breakfast there instead of the continental at the hotel. This hotel is newly renovated and is awesome. The staff was wonderful too. We got our room for $99 and it was comparable to the $149 room we stayed in at a new Hampton in Wisconsin last year. This was our first stay at a Sleep Inn but it won't be our last. We booked while we were there for the BBQ festival in May.

      "Text: We have stayed at Embassy Suites in other cities and have always been very happy, so when planning a trip to visit family in Philly, we decided to try this Embassy Suites. I have also never written a negative review, but felt that our experience warranted it. When we arrived, the two double beds that I had reserved were not available and we three adults were placed in a King room. My daughter slept on the sleep sofa, which is probably fine for children, but was very uncomfortable for her, resulting in complaints of back pain throughout the trip. \n",
      "The room itself was fairly clean, but lots of candy wrappers under the sleep sofa, plaster bits around on the rug in both rooms, and some kind of splatter on the walls and lampshade of the main sitting room. I discovered that the plaster was from series of large patches on the wall of the bedroom. That was the view from the bed. The lampshade next to the patched wall also had been crushed. Little things, but felt like I was in a slum. \n",
      " Although we had reserved and paid for three adults, the room was set up for two so we had to seek out glasses and towels each day. The breakfast hosts on all mornings were short tempered (and appeared to be overworked.) The buffet itself could have been ok, but the kitchen obviously had difficulty keeping up with the demand. We waited about 45 minutes for just some oatmeal one morning, and finally gave up and left to buy breakfast elsewhere. There was plenty of bread for toast, cold cereal, muffins, but hard to get healthier options like bagels, fresh fruit, or hot cereal. Coffee ran out 3/3 mornings also. On the mornings that we had a little extra time, we waited but were still not able to get our simple preferences. On the morning that we had to be out by a designated time, we settled for dry cereal and toast. \n",
      "The hotel was very busy and the staff was generally courteous, although if we mentioned any of our concerns, the response was \" We have a large group here today.\" Evidently it was so busy that we often waited 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator up and a couple of times chose to walk down rather than wait. Additionally, the air conditioner/heat unit was incredibly loud, so we had to turn it on for a while, shut it off to sleep, wake up hot, turn it on to cool, then off to sleep. At check out, we were charged for an extra night of parking and after waiting for breakfast, found it irritating to have to wait to resolve the overcharge. We did stop a the manager's reception one night where they served unlimited drinks, potato chips and bags of chex mix. It was nice, although a couple of free drinks and chips certainly does not make up for the inconveniences. The only saving grace for us for this facility was that the location is very good.\n",

We didn't have any problem at all with noise from the street. The first night, we heard sirens from an ambulance or firetruck, but other than that, no problems whatsoever. The windows are tightly sealed which helps to keep the sound from the street down. \n",

      "Text: Many older hotels are remodelling and upgrading their guest rooms, but not many are investing extra time and effort to give their rooms some style and personality. The designers at the Tomo in Japan Center went out of their way to create rooms that are comfortable and relaxing but also fun to be in, with big hand-painted murals on the walls and artwork suggesting various Japanese pop culture images: Godzilla, Hello Kitty, and various anime characters. Upon arrival I was greeted in the lobby by television monitors showing Japanese cartoons and old Godzilla movies, and I was immediately handed a free sample of cold flavored sake. Definitely the nicest greeting I've ever experienced. The desk clerk honored my request for a room at the back. The room on the 7th floor contained a king-size bed, flat-screen TV (which only got a few channels and even those were fuzzy), and all the stuff you expect these days in a mid-range hotel. The decor was basically modern Japan, with some unusual touches, like the mural depicting a monster (not Godzilla) attacking Tokyo, and a large photograph of a woman's eye. Even with the artwork the room was extremely comfortable, and I knew right away I would enjoy a good night's sleep. The location was so quiet I could have easily kept the window open all night, weather permitting. For a little over $100 this was an incredible bargain for a room of this quality in San Francisco. I parked overnight at the nearby Japan Center for $15, still a great deal. This neighborhood is packed with great restaurants. Between Japan Center and the restaurants along Fillmore you've easily got a week's worth of great dining, all within a five minute walk. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting SF: business travellers, families, honeymooners, anybody. The unique decor (and the low rates) should appeal to anyone.\n",

Unfortunately, it didn't even occur to me to ask why, but the suite was wonderful. Both the bedroom and living room had flat screen TVs and each room and the bathroom had windows overlooking Amsterdam Ave. The room was very comfortable and quit and had outstanding AC which was more than welcome during one of the hotter weeks in NY. At checkin, the staff was very friendly. We did arrive before check-in time and the room was not ready, but we were able to check our bags and begin our vacation. \n",

The location was fantastic, our room was 5 star (it was so big and plush) with stunning views and walking distance to city walk and Universal Studios. Every night we would walk to city walk and have dinner in one of their restaurants and then walk back to the hotel. The hop on hop off bus even comes to the door of the hotel I think every 30 mins and drops you right outside the Chinese Theatre and the metro is just a short walk down the road and one stop to the Walk of Fame. This was our first time to LA and we loved every minute of it. We would definitely be recommending the Hilton to friends and family.\n",

What sets them apart from all of the others is their service. We were greated very warmly at the valet. We were asked what brought us to the Omni and we let them know we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, to which we were told, \"Happy Anniversary\" several times. At check in, we were asked the same question and received the same pleasant anniversary wishes from several of those working in the area. After we returned from our evening out on Friday night, we returned to find our bed covered with rose petals, a bottle of wine and glasses, along with chocolate covered strawberries and a card signed by several of the staff. So impressive!!! We were also very impressed with those working in the Severin Bar. They were so nice and very friendly. We had some small hiccups - the shower on our last day was not exactly warm and a bit a wait to retrieve our car from valet. But those 2 things were absolutely minor in comparison to the whole experience. You can bet we'll be back!\n",

The location of the hotel is nice, at least in my opinion. It is a little bit away from Cherry Creek Shopping Center and all the bustle that goes with that, but not too far. It is a very easy drive to anything you want to do in Denver. I requested a late checkout the day before checkout, and the front desk was very accommodating, and upfront about the fact that if I wanted to check out later than 3:00pm it would be a half day, but up to there it is not.

      "ROOMS\n",
      "We were staying on the 33rd floor and the views were so fab. The celings were high and beds were so comfortable, but a little small for a double. The bathroom had black marble surfaces with a large shower/bath and loo! A giant plasma T.V was great! And the fact the room was so big was nice. The only thing that saddened me was the view of ground 0 at night, it was anawful view, but it was nice to see improvements.\n",
      "CONCIERGE\n",
      "During the day the staff were polite and extremly helpful, but at night they are very different. We asked for the nearest sit down pizza place and the lady said erm go down the street and make a left. So we did and found that it was shut! Then we walked about 100 yards further and found a really nice little place!\n",
      "POOL AND EXERCISE ROOM\n",
      "The pool was great, a big size and was nearly always empty, it had fab views out of the window and the changing rooms were very clean. The pool guy was very helpful with tips of where to go and what to do. And the exercise room looked really nice, clean and pretty average.\n",
      "OTHER TIPS\n",
      "Go up to the 55th floor and look out at the view- its so great, but just dont go into the suites! And if your not so adverturous go down onto the 54th floor and take a look from there. The pool is least busyiest at around 6:30 to 7 PM because closing time is 10 most people like to go for a late dip, and going just that bit earlier means that everyone else will be eating their dinner. Take a look at the flag next to the Concierge bit on the ground floor it has an interesting history to it!\n",

We stayed in a room on the 25th floor that had one bedroom, and a separate room that with a fireplace that led to the balcony. Chances are if you're looking at this place, you've done enough research, so just go already! Service is great, it's no tipping so even if you try to tip they won't take it, food is excellent and Ria is the same kitchen as Balsan, so quality in both. We had brunch there on a Sunday and the consistecny or service was the same . . . great. Brunch is two courses, one is a series of mini breads, scones, and muffin tops with different spread and dips, the other is your choice of a series of entrees. We went for a run one morning and were told to \"enjoy our run\", then when we got back, we were asked \"how was our run?\", and then when inside the lobby, we were greeted by a nice young lady who said she hoped we enjoyed our run and handed us each a bottle of ice cold water.

      "Text: The New York Palace\n",
      "I stayed at the NY Palace with my sister and parents for 6 nights in June 2010. While the hotel offers a good location and spacious, comfortable rooms, many among the staff there do their best to ruin the experience.\n",
      "To list a few of the problems we have encountered;\n",
      "- On our first day I spoke to the concierge about booking a restaurant and thought they were extremely polite and I was very pleased. Little did I know that, while he was being polite to me on the phone, he was making fun of my name to his colleagues at the concierge desk AND the person from the restaurant while making the booking. All this was witnessed by my sister who happened to be downstairs waiting at the concierge about something else.\n",
      "I told this to the restaurant manager who a couple of days later asked us about our stay and, to their credit, he passed on the message to the concierge manager who then sent me a hand written apology note with champagne and strawberries (also to my parents who were upset about the restaurant). This was a nice touch and at least an effort towards damage control.\n",
      "- My name and surname were switched by mistake during the booking. We tried to tell the hotel this from the first day however as they neglected to correct the mistake we had many problems;\n",
      " - We had forgotten some stuff in East Hampton where we stayed before arriving at NYC. Our host there was going to send them to us by mail. I gave him the hotel number and details, he called to confirm the address and was told by the receptionist that our reservation was cancelled! \n",
      " - He sent the package when I assured him that we were, in fact, still staying the NY Palace. Just to make sure, I called the reception and package deliveries and told them we would be expecting a package, trying to ensure that they knew what name to look out for and didn’t mess up. As you can imagine we had to ask after the package for a few days, constantly being told that it had not arrived. The hotel finally gave us our package it on Thursday after my contacting the cargo company and getting the tracking number (it had arrived on Tuesday morning on my name).\n",
      "- The service at the Istana restaurant (where we went for breakfast) was terrible and only after many complaints a few of the waiters started paying special attention to us. Before that, they were inattentive bordering on rude. We regretted our breakfast being included in the price.\n",
      "The NY Palace is a hotel that holds potential but they need to work on the service and staff behaviour. It seemed to us that the only people who smiled at guests were the housekeeping staff. Everyone else had an arrogant and indifferent attitude.\n",

The room was a bit small for my taste and the bathroom had limited privacy. My room had this pacific island theme and there was a window with shutters that separated the living area from the bathroom...weird!! But it was kinda cool. The \"heavenly\" beds were very comfy and the view was great looking out across Lake Michigan. I'd have to say the only downside to this hotel is the fact that they were in the middle of renovations during my stay and we had to \"pardon the dust\"....I understood. Hey, they have to upgrade at some point, right?? And the weirdest thing would have to be when we came back at about 2 AM after the wedding we attended was over, we pulled up and to find the lobby has been transformed into a nightclub. I thought this was very interesting except for the fact that there was about 10 people laying down outside and they were clearly inebriated and ready to puke. I mentioned to my brother that if we were just arriving for the first time right then, I would've been very turned off that such a high class hotel turns into a pukefest nightclub. Don't get me wrong, I think the whole nightclub thing in the lobby was cool...just not the puking guests laying all over the place outside the front entrance.

It's marble with a tub big enough to soak in and the normal Westin heavenly shower. We had a flat panel TV with plenty of channels. I really liked all the dark wood and beautiful crystal chandeliers in the lobby. It's very elegant.

      "Text: We check in to this hotel after having a bad experience at another hotel a few blocks away. The doormen were all very helpful and seemed very genuine. We arrived around 8 am because we could not stay in the previous hotel any longer and the front desk got us checked in and to our rooms in just a few moments. The room was also very comfortable and there was plenty or room for the four large pieces of luggage we brought. There were a few small issues 1. I requested another blanket and called several times but never received the blanket. The next morning I went to the front desk and let them know that I needed a blanket for that evening and it was taken care of. 2. My rate included a daily coffee card, subway card, movie and mini bar credit. I had to visit the desk three times to get this included value, including the morning I check out to remove the mini bar charges. 3. the afternoon before check out the next morning, we called about weighing our luggage and were told not a problem just bring it down to the business center. So at 5:30 pm we go down to the business center with four large bags wait inside the business center that appears to be closed until someone from the front desk finally comes over to ask if they can help. She offers to find us some help. In the meantime (5:45 pm) the gentleman that actually works in the business center appears and says he is closing at 6:00 pm and does not have time to weigh our luggage that will take all of 30 seconds. So we ask him to get us someone willing to help. He sighs and gets the scale. Overall this hotel is really a good hotel that could be great with just a little customer service and pride from the staff.\n",

      "Text: My husband surprised me for our anniversary this past weekend by taking me to Hotel ZaZa in Houston. He kept telling me that the hotel was a surprise. I couldn't imagine a hotel being any better than the many thousands of hotels we've already stayed in. I was a flight attendant for over 8 years and felt that if you stayed in one, you stayed in them all. Boy was I surprised. From the moment we pulled up to the hotel, I could tell things we were different. Once we stepped into the lobby, I noticed how upscale the atmosphere was. Surprisingly though, the staff and service was very warm. When I walked into our room, \"That's Entertainment\" concept suite, my mouth dropped. Our room was gorgeous and I loved the theme. The Monarch restaurant was outstanding. The chef came out and spoke to me because I requested to alter a dish. He wanted to talk to me on how he could make my dish taste great with some other ideas on my request. My husband and I were supposed to go out to a club later that night, but we had such a good time at the restaurant, we stayed there all night and partied. We were treated like royalty our entire stay, all the way to the last moment of our stay when a staff member opened my car door for me and gave me a bottle of water. This hotel surpassed all other 4 star hotels I've ever stayed in. We will come back for every anniversary for the rest of our lives. Can't wait 'till next year!\n",

      "Text: If you book a reservation with the Driskill, forget about popular chain hotel experiences. Its not flashy and shiny. Its more - its beautiful, classy and magical. This is a historical experience within a hotel setting. Nice artwork all through the hotel and hallways. We booked the Queen/Queen with window because of the small room factor. Yes, its small but it was clean, cozy and quiet. The beds are so comfortable so much so the middle rod supporting it popped out while we were asleep. The sound woke us up. We laughed, thought about the ghost stories,rolled over and went back to sleep. The bed was still comfortable. 82yr old Mom said \"I had the best sleep\" and she has a pillowtop at home. Our bathroom was large enough to accomodate a wheelchair if necessary, had good lighting, upscale natural products, extra soft towels and they provided a makeup mirror in the bedroom if you needed it. We could adjust the temp of the room. We were in Rm 909 facing out 7th street because we were traveling with my elderly Mom and needed a quiet place. The size of the room helped us out, she didn't feel scared or intimidated when we left her for the concert that evening The staff was great very professional not snobbish. They didn't make me feel out of place and I appreciate that as I was worried about this. I've traveled in and out of country and that has been a sad issue at some hotels that think snobbishness = class. We felt welcomed from the moment we got out of the car to go into the hotel. I was happy to see people of all races/ages enjoying themselves in the piano bar and lobbies for the holidays.They had the largest Christmas tree I've ever seen beautifully decorated. 6th street is youthful too cool. Had to ignore only 1 persistent young panhandler. Felt it wouldn't be a safe idea to show financial compassion so many down. I prayed instead. Music everywhere. After partying I stayed up and read sitting on this wonderful highback chair. State Capitol few blocks over. Good mix of youth and history. Delicious bakery and coffee. Didn't want to leave and going back to stay for a few days for the holidays 2012. It has flavor,character and its deserves all 4 stars. I booked through Expedia got a good price\n",

We called Relax & Rejuvenate spa services to our room for a mani-pedi for her and a massage for me. Jessie & Amy were great!

      "Cons:\n",
      "Have to pay for internet. You could go to 16 street mall to barnes and noble for free wifi, but that can be annoying. Although the worst part of all during my stay was how you can hear everything from your room. Now I understand the hotel can not help this issue, but be mindful when you book a room at this hotel. Request a room that is not connected, unless your staying with a group of people. The problem is you can basically hear everything in the room next door. Not fun when you are trying to sleep at 12:00 in the morning and it literally feels that the people next store are in your room. However, when I complained about the noise the staff was more than accomodating to help, which was really nice and appreciated. Also if you’re staying here it is not really a hotel to stay for leisure because whenever there is a convention going on those people (i.e. the shriners) take over the hotel, which can be annoying at times.\n",

A short walk to the North End. My husband and kids loved going up to the observatory level (I skipped as I am afraid of heights!). There are only about 4 rooms on each level, there are times when we thought we were the only people staying here it was so quiet! Loved it here and would absolutely come again.\n",

      "We didn't spend too much time in the room, but when we did we found it was very comfortable, quiet (even though near a lift) and the air-con did a great job. The staff were great, didn't have to deal with them much beyond check-in/out, but were very helpful and arranged a taxi for our flight back.\n",
      "We stayed in a superior queen room, which had a flat screen TV, a safe (free to use) and was able to access the free wireless connection. The shower was brilliant and the bed very comfortable. Several people on here have said the rooms are small - although they're not massive, they're more than enough for two people plus luggage etc.\n",

WOW. what a suite it was indeed. Location of hotel also excellent; lot's of stuff at walking distance. Parking indeed expensive, but it's expensive everywhere downtown chicago. Breakfast was - although the food itself was great - the only poor point of this hotel: it seemed disorganised and there was constantly a line of people \"wating to be seated\" although there were empty seats abundantly available; one person taking care of that and she did other things in between as well; also we had to wait like 20 minutes for our coffee and then it came twice; i.e. don't go for breakfast if you are in a hurry. \n",

      "Text: Most of the basics are there, comfortable bed/bedding, good plumbing, acceptable service attitude, and rooms that have aged relatively well. The confirmed Gold Passport Diamond upgrade landed us a Park Executive Suite or at least that was what the front desk agent called it. The 1-BR suite was spacious and contained 1.5 baths, a long sofa, and a square living room table in lieu of a more traditional work desk (no work surface in the bedroom). We took advantage of the loaner bicycles at the concierge. For the cost conscious, the valet parking is $48 per night. Perhaps a way to describe the property location would be ‘near the center of everything, but close to nothing’, except for the independent cinemas on the back side of the hotel, but not a big deal if you are planning to drive everywhere as we were. While I would rate this property ahead of The Williard, in comparison to Park Hyatts in Asia, this location falls way short.\n",

      "For those who can't be bothered to read long reviews, my summary:\n",
      "- Great sleep (quiet and comfortable)\n",
      "- Characterful and friendly\n",
      "- Good price\n",
      "- Good location\n",
      "- Don't eat the carrots\n",
      "For those with more time on their hands:\n",
      "How very, very nice it was to stay in a hotel with some character, rather than the bland formula of an hotel like a Hya-lto-rriott. I found the general feel of the Omni very comforting - like they've been taking care of important people for years and I was in good hands. I might not be considered that important by many other people - but they appeared to find me so, and I enjoyed going along with it.\n",
      "A huge positive point for me was the fact that I slept like a baby. Like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room, in fact. This hotel is made out of good, solid materials, not the usual plasterboard and echo-ey corridors of an ant hotel. I wasn't once kept awake by frisky neighbours, or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms. Good sleep = good mood and good work.\n",
      "In comparison to other business district hotels I found it very reasonably priced. I loved the morning delivery of coffee and juice that was included as part of their rewards programme. Oh, how such small things make such a difference to the way you start your day.\n",
      "Other than that ... friendly, helpful staff and great location for the business district. Although it's a little way from the tourist hotspots, it's no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport ... or, (heaven forbid) use your legs!\n",
      "The one and only issue I stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant - so maybe it's not that fair to post here ... but since the restuarant is affiliated, and there's a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it, I will!\n",
      "The issue? The gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate, reclining in its self-satisfied way against my mightily over-priced and, presumably, very embarrassed steak.\n",
      "That long, lone carrot was, quite honestly, the most revolting vegetable I've ever eaten - and that includes the times I've accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery (food of the devil) in a salad. I can't believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere.\n",
      "If you're a beef aficionado - or even just someone who likes good food - just don't bother. Yes, the steak tasted good ... but not an eye-rolling, conversation-stopping, stress-sapping, umami-ridden explosion of great that I'd expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef.\n",

Upon entering the hotel, marbled steps lead you down towards a sunken lobby, canopied by a crystal chandelier. Fresh fruit and lemonade are offered to guests. The desk staff are warm and helpful. Every hotel employee says hello. The first time I stayed at this hotel, I noticed the housekeeping staff greeted us on our way to our room! Not just a \"hello,\" but with a big smile! The spare roll of toilet paper was tied with a satin lacy ribbon. The end of the rolls are folded to make a double point and are embossed with the omni seal! Their toiletries are really nice.

This was from recommendations by previous Trip Advisor Travellers. We were told by the hotel that they could not guarantee this as the hotel was fully booked. However on arrival we were taken to Room 2904 and we were not to be disappointed. We had one of the most spectacular views that i have ever seen The Chrysler Building and Midtown New York lit up in all its glory. A magnificent sight to go to bed to at night. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were professional and courteous. They even have a pillow menu 5 different types of pillow from soft to hard never had that in a hotel before. The hotel is only 4 blocks from The Empire State Building about 5 to 10 minute walk. About 15 minute walk to Macys and 20 minutes to Times Square/ Broadway. Contrary to reports before we went we found taxis to be clean quick and reasonably cheap. We used one from JFK to our hotel it was cheaper than the train (4 of us were travelling ) 45 dollars which is the standard rate to anywhere in Manhatten plus a 4 dollars 95 cents payment for a bridge toll. A deli that i can recommend for breakfast is Cafe Metro great value and everything cooked fresh and to order in front of you. It is on the corner of 370 Lexington 41st a great start to the day.

And maybe this is standard procedure there but the bedsheets were tucked in so far at the bottom that the covers didn't even reach up to one's shoulders. And (almost forgot), the heating system was never able to take the chill out of the air; we only wanted to increase the temp by about 3F but even overnight it never rose.\n",

On arrival we were told that there were no studio suites available, so they would give us a one room suite on the understanding that we'd move out the next day into the studio suite we had booked. Later that evening we had a phonecall telling us that we could stay in the one room suite. We were very happy as it had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The suite was very comfortable, two decent sized rooms and a kitchenette also three phones, two televisions and two bathrooms. The bathroom in the bedroom was very small, as has been mentioned before, but it was more than adequate and very clean. There was a desk, chair, coffee table and sofa in the living area.\n",

There is a shop next door which sells drinks, snacks and sandwiches and there are a lot of restaurants in the area. 34th Street is excellent for shopping, and you are within walking distance of 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The only negative was the noise from the building site across the road (on 31st street.) We were on the 16th floor, but could still hear when the builders started (at 7am!). The building site was next to a church (which rang it's bells daily at 7am), and opposite that was the famous fire station which was on the go a lot of the time. I think that the noise would be most noticeable on the north and east sides of the hotel (we faced east), and you might be better on the south or west sides of the hotel if it bothers you. They are still refurbishing, and you enter the hotel via the 31st Street entrance, but this is not a problem as there are plenty of porters to move your bags for you. The refurbishing was not a problem at all. No noise or hassle.\n",

The day we checked out we were able to store our luggage in a storage room while we spent the day in the city. The parking is $20 a day, just across the street, that is a fantastic rate!

I instantly thought how it reminded me of our trip to Hawaii, and how perfect this place would be, being right on the bay and with a room feet away from the sand. It did not disappoint for a second. The pools were great, the bike rentals on sight, the restaurants, quick room service, other activities, ducks and fish all around the property, but most importantly the fire pit on the beach 10 feet from our door and water another 10 feet, this place provided such a wonderful time for us and our 2 year old, that it quickly became one of the best places we have ever visited, and we travel extensively. \n",

We were upgraded all the way to the Presidential Suite, and they saved our vacation which had so been nearly ruined by the Hilton. I can not say enough about this place, and with all that they have done for us, and how we were treated both times, this is my FAVORITE place to stay in San Diego, and should not be missed. We are going back in September. My only mistake in June was not going with Paradise Point to begin with. Don't second guess this place.

The staff is young and clueless (you should know that the loop of the business park you are in is just a tad more than 0.5 miles, and you shouldn’t be giving out handouts claiming it’s 1.29). Your staff should know how long travel time to attractions (Bank of America Stadium, etc) should be distance and time wise. It’s just sad that they didn’t. There is no exercise room/facility on site, but they do offer day passes to a local gym, but they can’t tell you how close it is. The pool area is only accessible from outside?!?! It’s a nice pool, but nothing special. The breakfast area is small, but I left too early to comment on the amenities. The room is fine and is pretty standard. The sink area indeed is a touch small, but not a problem. The Wifi is a little slow, but not achingly so. The problem with this property is two fold; A.) its new(ish) so the expectation level is higher, B.) the Fairfield brand has undergone major upgrades over the past few years so here again the expectation level is raised.

When we did check in it was the smallest room ever ,no floor space for cases and we were there for 5 nights , only room to walk around the bed so we went back to reception and free upgrade ? To a larger room all ok apart from had not been hoovered there was even some pills on carpet and other items that you could clearly see ! We are not complainers but the pills could be anything and I took them to reception along with other bits , we were apologised to and that while we were out the room would be given a deep clean ! But no the carpets were never hoovered the whole time we were there and behind furniture was discusting so take slippers , other than that the hotel was fine we were out site seeing day and night so it was ideal to crash and very good area, but paying the sort of money we did you expect the place to be cleaned. New York overall is brill but people don't do anything not even speak to you unless you tip , I only tip for good service not when people expect it which is what seems to go on in new York !\n",

The room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural. The bedding was very comfortable.

From here we tended to walk to other attractions such as Fishermans wharf which took about half an hour up and some steep hills but a good way to see SF. However, public transport from this area is excellent. Very friendly staff and they upgraded us for our honeymoon. Very good housekeeping with excellent bed, cleaning and free, good quality toiletries. Free wifi which is helpful and coffee making facilities on in room but on our floor.

      "At first I was apprehensive about having a room facing Columbus Avenue as I am a light sleeper and have read past reviews about the traffic noise but I was not kept awake by the street noises at all, however, as we were there from a Friday night to a Monday morning, the traffic noise may be different on a weekday.\n",

We then discovered a Cafe on Columbus Ave, heading 3 blocks towards Fishermans Wharf & across the road from The Holiday Inn. The Diner/Cafe (sorry can't remember the name) had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also. Located next to the Diner was an Internet Coffee Shop, we used the internet here to pre-checkin for our flight on Southwest Airlines and they also printed the Boarding passes for 50cents per page.\n",
      "The Columbus Inn was a fantastic find in a great location for a truely great price and we easily walked to Fishermans Wharf, Lombard Street and to the Pier which the ferry for Alcatraz tours leaves from and we caught the bus which leaves outside the hotel to Union Square and then caught the Cable Car back.\n",
      "I had originally booked a hotel in Union Square but then changed my mind and booked the Columbus Motor Inn mainly for the great price and for the additional bedroom and I was so glad that we didn't stay at Union Square as my husband and 2 teenage sons were not at all interested at shopping at all so I was glad we settled for a hotel that was close to Fishermans Wharf and the attractions that are in that area,.\n",

The location is prime - there is a subway station just one block north from the hotel. We stayed in a room with a double bed and a private bathroom. It was small but manageable. It was decorated nicely, something you'd expect a suffragette to stay in during the early 1900s. There was a TV, a very efficient heater, and A/C. The rooms were cleaned each day very nicely. The hotel itself was quiet the entire time. Only on Saturday night did some street noise filter in, but we turned on the air to low and it was blocked out. Be sure to book your room through the internet or with the internet price on hand over the phone - it's much cheaper. The staff was friendly and the iron and ironing board I borrowed from them worked well. My only quip is that the man who checked us in gave us an uncomfortable and bothersome stare and remark about my boyfriend and I sharing a double bed. He wasn't hostile, but you sure don't expect it less than a mile from where the Stonewall riots took place. Also, the elevator is small but quaint with its archaic gated door. All in all, a great, great, great place for those people who don't need to be pampered and overcharged but enjoy sleeping in comfortable and quiet hotels.\n",

The staff were nice, the decor was great, the room was clean. I really have no complaints. We requested a higher up floor (which by the way, makes NO difference in outside sounds!) and they accommodated us with no issue. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. It seems as though they added lighting to the rooms, they weren't dark like the other reviews said. The lobby is dark and the hallways are dark, but we never found it to be an issue. It's in an amazing location, half a block to the 59st/Columbus Circle subway and just as close to Central Park.

      "The only complaint that I have is that the hotel will not hold our luggage for 2 nights if we don't have a future reservation and quoted us due to liability and suggested that we stored our lugguage in Penn Station.

We explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on 3rd day to Jersey City and would this change? No, SORRY, that is the reply! I found this VERY DISCRIMATING as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay, otherwise, once your stay is over, SORRY, you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem! In my prior stay of hotel like Sheraton Vancouver, they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding . This is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at Penn Station. So, apart from this issue of not able to hold our 1 piece luggage since we have no pending reservation, which I found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an UNHELPFUL hotel meeting guest needs.\n",

The lobby was quaint and I loved all the dark wood trim throughout. We laughed about the fact that the only noise we heard in our room came from birds in the morning - no traffic noise. The room looked better than what we saw on the website. We'd stay there again for sure.\n",

I'm a Hilton Gold member so upon arrival to my room I received a hand written welcome note with a bag of complimentary snacks and water in lieu of a room upgrade (as no such upgrade was available). The rooms are spacious for NYC and seemed recently renovated, very clean and up to date. We opted for the Bed & Breakfast deal which got our day off to a good start. I was happy to see that breakfast was served in the adjoining restaurant Pigalle, as I have had numerous good dinners there before. I was very happy about the free internet, and the MP3 hook up to the alarm clock. It's pretty easy to pick up cabs from the hotel and there are great restaurants on the surrounding blocks. \n",

We rent a car from Budget (which is literally on the opposite corner of the hotel) and return it the night before our flight, walk back to the hotel and then take the shuttle to the airport. Included in the room rate is a delicious cooked to order breakfast each morning. The indoor pool is OK - a little cave-like but it does the job. They also have HBO and Cartoon Network - heaven! This hotel is clean and a good bargain. They are also close to attractions such as the LaBrea tar pits, Hollywood Blvd, Rodeo Drive and Sunset Ranch (great trail rides through the Hollywood Hills). Also, if you're into snowboarding/skiing check out Mt. Baldy - about 45 minutes from this hotel. My husband and son went snowboarding on our trip in April and were very impressed by the size of the mountain.\n",

      "Text: Almost 5 years ago, I gave this place two huge thumbs up. I decided to return to see if my experience could be replicated. It was not, it was exceeded!!! As usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do. I booked late and through a third party site, during a very busy time in NY. While I was prepared for a broom closet with a bed, I was upgraded without request upon arrival. Later in my stay I met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in NY. I had to come back to the city the following week, and mentioned this to the manager as I was checking out. I had checked the 3rd party site, but the City Club wasn't showing any availability. Not only did the manager secure a room for me, but also at an extremely competitive price. He also gave me his card. I shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and BOOM. Another upgrade, this time to the two story suite. All I can say is don't die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach, boast two story windows, and a spiral staircase that is ultra hip....amazing, and would be well worth the standard suite price. Let me give 2 more quick asides about this place. 1. I was running late when i realized that I had forgotten a toiletry item. A call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes - this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel. Larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time. 2. The front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived. Then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and I should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room. The City Club is still in a great central location, with great design, and amenities, but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom. My wife wants to see the Yankee's in the playoff's for our Anniversary. Anybody wanna guess where we'll be staying? \n",

      "We were in Vegas, and the extreme weather on the East Coast cost us (and thousands others) their flights, initenerary's, schedules, time and money.

      "So, we had to finalize everything double quick, or risk getting stuck when we reached San Fran (or hang around the San Fran airport till (and if) we got something decent in our budget).

Needless to say I asked to see the \"suite\" we booked before presenting our credit card. The friendly desk clerk obliged with no problem. The rooms were small as advertised, but clean. The bathroom was miniscule, but adequate, and spotlessly clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows were of high quality. There was no sign of any bugs, either cockroaches or bedbugs. Our rooms were freshly painted and there was no sight of peeling paint anywhere. I slept like a baby with the window open. The second night I asked the desk for another blanket and it was on my bed upon my return. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The subway is two short blocks away, and cabs were easily caught on West End Avenue, a block away. If your plan is to find inexpensive accomodations and are travelling with a friend or with children, the suite at $109/night is unbeatable. The two rooms connected by the bath gave us privacy we could have never had in a standard double room. I will stay here again.\n",

Also, the atmosphere in the lobby, restaurant, and bar area is cool and chic while being welcoming and relaxed at the same time. My only qualm was that the hotel automatically adds a tip to restaurant bills and I ended up double tipping on my bills during the first days of my stay until I asked a waiter what the \"sc\" charge on my bill stood for.

While the agent at the desk was welcoming me and asking for my credit card and ID, he stood there staring at me. Eventually, I realized that he had no intention of leaving without a tip. Nor did he intend to help me with the baggage to the room. 20 feet of unwanted assistance, and then he demands a tip?!

We were very pleased with the room – an extremely comfy bed, nice streamlined furnishings, a very European feel to the bath, and a separate closet/dressing table area. Very upscale. It was nice to have a docking station for our iPod, and there’s a cooler full of bagged ice in the hall near the elevator. Nice for coolers and chilling the wine! \n",

We love to walk, so the location was not an issue for us, but it is a good three blocks to the nearest Metro station and farther for some lines. Dinner at their restaurant, Print, was excellent. We also really enjoyed Stecchino Wine Bar on 9th, PJ Clarkes across from Lincoln Center – try the lobster BLT, Caffee Ciello on 8th, and picking up some take out from the Amish Market on 9th. Sunday morning, we took a walk along the river and then came back through Chelsea where we had a great breakfast at Le Grainne.

Complimentary drinks and snacks in the room and the lobby, including complimentary wine at 6pm every night. Amazing breakfast, definitely worth the 'B and B' option. Large, modern and sleek room with everything I could have wanted. No bath but what the hell, the shower was ace anyway. Even the toiletries were gorgeous!! One minor thing to mention: we had read that the bar was a really good place to go, but it wasn't that happening when we went. However, we had some good cocktails there. Go stay!!!\n",

The 7 nights stay was booked very quickly and I was given the choice to pay at the time of booking or at check in, this gave me the opportunity to keep an eye on the exchange rates secure the best rate I could when paying.\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel and through the front door, it was good to be back. We were immediately welcomed to the hotel. There were a few guests in front of us, so we had a little wait, but nothing too long. Our suitcases were taken to the side for us whilst we waited. Whilst waiting, it was evident that the professionalism and level of service had not changed as the guests before us were being dealt with quickly by the very helpful front desk staff.\n",
      "I am happy to report that the hotel is still as excellent as it was a year ago. When our turn to check in arrived, we were welcomed back, this being our second stay at the hotel. The staff member checking us in was very polite and processed us quickly asking if we needed anything, like a map of the city etc and was quite surprised when I said I still had a map from a trip some 3 years ago. \n",

I really like the rooms at this hotel, they are a decent size and very comfortable, with excellent amenities. The addition of the coffee/tea machines in the room is a plus, though I still prefer the fresh coffee in the lobby each morning.\n",

      "The staff seem to be very proud to be a part of what makes the Distrikt Hotel such a special place and welcome comments about what is good / bad about a guests experience. This can be seen when a guest last year commented about not having coffee / tea facilities in the rooms and within a day or two every room had a machine.\n",
      "Overall, I have had yet another excellent stay at the Distrikt and cannot recommend this hotel enough. I do not usually make return visits to hotels, but having had two excellent stays here, this is a hotel that I will not hesitate to return to, so much so that I am already planning next years trip.\n",

It had two queen beds that were extremely comfortable as well as a large pull out sofa and kitchenette. We requested a handicap room and the bathroom was wonderful. It was very large, with a roll-in shower. The pool was clean as well as the area surrounding the pool. Everything was well maintained at this property. The free breakfast was delicious with lots to choose from, including a fantastic waffle maker. You could eat indoors or outside. They were in the process of setting up a nice little \"bar\" area in the lobby while I was there. They have two computers in the lobby that you can use for free. Elevators were spacious and fast. The staff were outstanding. I'm sorry I didn't get the name of the lady who was extremely helpful in getting our handicap room keys so I could mention her here. There was a gentleman named Kevin who was also very nice and helpful (the shorter of the 2 Kevin's). The best part was the location. You walk out the door and right onto the $1.00 trolley downtown to Beale St. or you could walk (10 mins - I timed it twice). It was on a very lovely tree lined street with a park across the street as well as a Walgreen's and great restaurants. Sam's (on the corner) had a wonderful chicken breast sandwich & fries for $6.50! Another restaurant on the next corner called \"The Flight\" (I think) was also very nice - a little more elegant and a little more pricey but very good food - $11-$26 for chicken or steak dinner, depending on the size you order. Beale St. had a great bar called \"Wet Willie's\". I highly recommend this property!\n",

I booked five nights on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the bed. It's better than the one I have at home and mine is a very high quality mattress. The room was spotlessly clean and the bath area had been recently remodeled with very high quality tile (and a pattern even). It was a suite-sized space, with a love seat, king bed, fridge, microwave, CD player and DVD player. Now, for the fun of the place.... When I turned the lights off at night, stars glowed on the walls and the ceilings. There was a blacklight and some really neat murals on the walls. When I came the first time, I had asked for bedside lights to read by since the room didn't have any. I also could not get wireless, plus had a broken bathplug. When I came to my room later the same day as mentioning it to the manager, the tub was fixed, I had a hardwire cord in my room for internet and two bedside lamps. I was so impressed! Any property can have issues, but it's how quick they are addressed that makes such a difference. This was whiplash fast! Now for the really good part. I came back two weeks later for an overnight trip. When I arrived to check in, the same nice manager had the same room reserved for me. He greeted me warmly and said he had the room I liked, the lamps and the internet ready for me. I was so touched to see what a great memory he had and how helpful he was! You know, it's really great to have people care about what they do and to do it the best they can. I travel a lot for business and I must say that I really feel welcome here, like my business matters. You don't get that much these days, especially for a such a great value.\n",

      "Second, hotel re-habbing is ongoing. THe main lobby area has been closed off. One of the elevators wasn't working. Clearly some rooms were in the process of being re-done. They said they were looking at a copule of months work...then they would be raising their rates to about $375 per room per night (above the very reasonable for location and siize I paid). Still the accomodations were a better bargain than some other suite hotels in the area...but the potential price increase will move it out of the good deal catagory.\n",

Much perferred the old-style matress, this would cause us to reconsider staying there again as we never felt we got a great night sleep.\n",

      "My few complaints: our remote didn't work and even changing the chanel on the t.v itself didn't work most of the time, maintenance came up but only brought a new remote that didn't fix the problem, but they were very friendly. Also, room service went ahead and charged an 18% tip without telling us so we ended up tipping an extra $5 on top of it. The food was ok and kind of expensive, I would not really recommend it, but what can you expect from room service? They also had another guest with the same name as my husband and ended up mixing up our 2 reservations with caused some problems with the keys, but they tried to fix it right away.\n",

      "Text: Don't understand the complaints on this website about this hotel. We stayed here for two nights in late August and loved everything about it. First, the location was great. It was within walking distance of both the waterfront and Pike Place Market, and we could easily take the monorail to the Space Needle. (There are hills in Seattle, so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking, you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi.) Both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated, and the staff was very helpful. Being on Pioneer Square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and/or something to eat. Of course, we didn't walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there, but that's just common sense. We were never bothered by anyone, and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city. If you're worried about street noise, call the hotel directly and ask for an \"interior\" room. We had an \"interior king\" and it was very quiet. We plan to return to Seattle, and when we do, we'll stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel again.\n",

I found dried food on the wall paper, hairs on the bathroom floor and the desk in the room when we first entered was not cleaned. Furthermore we used the 2 glasses in the room to drink some water and they were not changed for the 4 days we stayed there, even after we left a sign on top of them requesting that they be taken away. The most annoying for me though was that we were flying out at 6:30 in the morning and the restaurant would obviously not be open for breakfast therefore we spoke to the front desk in the early evening if we could have breakfast sent to our room as room service at 4:00 a.m. They told us they would ask and let us know later in the evening. At 10 p.m. upon asking them they informed us that yes we could have breakfast and to order it from now through room service. We then called room service, they told us no problem and to put what we wanted and the time on the paper hanging outside our door. We did so and needless to say at 4 a.m. NO BREAKFAST. Upon checking out we asked the front desk why we were not sent breakfast and they told us that since we booked with expedia, and even though we paid for a room with breakfast, they do not honour the expedia bookings as we were leaving early!!!!!!!!!!!! Then we were told that we could have had room service if we had paid for it seperately. I then told her that we had ordered room service but no one had brought us anything. Anyways, I would not stay here again. They definately need to upgrade their customer service.\n",

Having arrived mid morning from an early flight our room was not ready but we were told that a rush would be put on preparing the room. It gave us time to walk around the hotel and have lunch in the resturarant. We found everything very pleasant. When I inquired again about our room 1.5 hours later we were told that it wasn't ready yet. Still way before the 3:00 check in time so we decided to take a walk outside just as we were about to leave the premises one of the desk staff ran outside ( in about 30 degree weather) to catch up with us to tell us that our room was indeed ready. That is what I call service. The entire staff from the doorman to the maids were always pleasant and accomandating. I would absolutely recommend the hotel. There are a number of resturants within walking distance and the zoo is a short 4 blocks up the street. It is a short cab ride away from the National Mall and monuments ( $15. each way) but nice because it is away from the hustle and bustle. The room was enormous and clean and as a Omni Select Choice member were given complimentary beverages each morning and for a few dollars extra able to order a bagel or muffin which was just enough to hold us over until lunch. We also enjoyed a late check out time as a Select Choice member and would highly recommend you join the service.\n",

This hotel is a home away from home and the only place I would consider staying in the city. Close to absolutely everything and with so much to do in the area.

Try Fado on Locust and 15th or McCrosson's on N20th past the Franklin Institute for some great places to chill). Also as my business trips usually include a weekend it is the perfect base from which to explore the city for the weekend. But on the nights when I still have work to do or when I just want to relax, the rooms are very well equiped with a large work desk and free wi-fi or the gym on the 4th floor, which while a little small is never too crowded and is just about right for my needs.

The larger ones in particular (Rm 701 in December) are well fitted out with plenty of space and would be my recommendation.\n",

We booked our room through Hotwire for $80 per night. We had to pay $20 to park there Thurs., Fri. and Sat. nights because we had not booked with Sheraton. (Learning experience). We requested a king NS room & were told that is what we had. We opened the door to our room and it was two double beds! We called down to the front desk & they offered to change it, but it was no big deal. The internet fee was $5.95 for TWENTY MINUTES! Forget it! The room itself was also dark; dark beige walls and ugly dark pictures on the wall. The carpeting was NASTY and in severe need of being replaced. In fact, when we opened the door from the hallway to the bedroom (Rm. 427), the carpeting in the hallway was different from the nasty room carpeting which didn't even MEET the hallway carpeting! A nice gaping line with no carpeting! The bathroom was okay.....lighting was better in there than the bedroom area. They are scrimping on their toiletries these days! Also, the blankets on our beds had seen better days! Worn and pilling! WORST BEDS WE HAD EVER TRIED TO SLEEP ON!! What happened to the 'heavenly mattresses' the Sheraton advertises?

The rooms are average, if anything they are outdated but overall pretty good - possibly could be a little cleaner but it is nit-picky stuff I noticed, so not bad overall. Rooms were cleaned everyday with plently of clean towels. As far as the pool - don't get excited. It is outside next to the highway. So if you don't mind being on display to every car on the highway then it's not a big deal. The continental breakfast is held in the lobby where you check in so there is very limited room. The food was good - your typical donuts, bagels, cereal juice, coffee and such. They advertised free wireless internet connection in the rooms, but we could not get a connection. \n",
      "The BAD is, we originally booked this trip and reserved the rooms with a credit card. Because my husband travels during the week and typically stays at Days Inn when traveling, he is enrolled in their Trip Reward program. After the inital reservation was made we decided to use his Trip Reward points to pay for the room, and save a little cash for all of the other activities in San Antonio. When he called to book the room he let them know I had already reserved the room we just needed to verify we were going to use the points to pay. I had also called to cancel the second room I reserved as my in-laws had made a seperate reservation on their own. We arrived, checked in and everything was fine with the points. However when I returned home and checked my account my card had been charged for the rooms (yep, tow of them). I called to explain the situation and I was told that they probably just ran the card for pre-authorization and it wouldn't be posted to my account and that I should give it a few days. Of course it posted and I was charged to I called back again to get my money refunded. I was told they are busy and would look into it. No return call so I called back and was notified I was charged because I was a no show, and that they know my husband checked in but had a seperate room for me and charged me since I did not \"cancel\". I explained the situation, and how my husband frequently stays there, I did cancel one room (I did not have my cancellation number to prove it) but of course not the other because that is the one we stayed in. Apparently when we called to use the trip reward points they made an ADDITIONAL reservation - not so sure about that but that is the only conclusion I can come to. After no cooperation what so ever my husband notified them we would be calling their corporate office. They kindly informed us they are not a affiliated with corporate and that they are independently owned and basically that we could take a hike. So sorry. \n",

Parking is expensive but we were advised by a staff member that parking is free on the weekends and holidays. This saved us $70 or more by parking on the street. The staff member actually walked down the block a little, found us a spot and held it til we pulled our car into the spot! Hotel is 3 blocks to the metro line, in quiet safe neighborhood.

As a plat member, was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin (which is more spacious, got an extra window balcony to sit on). However, was travelling with friends so I requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead, no problems.\n",
      "Lobby: The staffs were friendly and efficient, the lobby is very hip/chic just like what you would expect at the typical W hotel. I like the hotel ambience espcially at night, so pretty. You'll see many people hanging out at the lobby XYZ bars at night time (There's a DJ there too). There's an Acura MDX Experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an one-way ride to most of the places in SF area (except airport, of course) and we did take advantage of it during our stay. The drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus. But due to the popular demand, I recommend reserve your time spot early!\n",
      "The Gym: Very nice, with complete sets of eplical machines, weights, and the swim pool /jacuzzi is right outside of the gym (which is very hip looking too). The gym opens 24/7 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm. Bliss Spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their mani/pedicure and other services but I did not get to try it out so I am not going to commend on that.\n",
      "The Room: Some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation (so for those who hates siren at night, you should request a room away from the firestation). Good AC (very quiet), and the lights in the room are very nice too. The bed is the typical W bed, not as heavenly as the Westin Heavenly Bed but certainly better than Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and other competitor's bed. I actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after I stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep. That tells you how much I like their bedding. The room is towards the small size (~300 sq ft?) but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff. The shower pressure is good, not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean. Toiletries is the standard Bliss Sinkside 6 (lemon sage scent) which is one of my favorite hotel product. One thing, the bathroom door has no lock and its very clear/see thru!! so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it! This is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey, its W so you need to be more open minded about it. Turndown service available on request every evening.\n",
      "Parking: $42/night, 1/2 off if you drive a hybrid. Since its SF, I did not drive, its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isn't it? Also, internet (WiFi) are free at the lobby so you'll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day.\n",
      "Overall: This is a good, well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more \"freshier\" look instead of the dark depressing color. Some people liked it, some don't. Of course, the price can be high for most people (at least 200+/night) but if you want to have fun, meet people or just want to enjoy the W scene, you should give this property a try. Don't stay there if you want a QUIET weekend getaway. W is all about fun :D\n",

It was really nice to come back to this beautiful hotel and relax at the pool - which was incredible - complete with drink and food service, and a 24 hour fitness center. We booked two rooms (one a suite), and the hotel accommodated us nicely, placing the rooms next to each other. We did enjoy our stay - even though we had the misfortune of being there two nights when fire alarms went off (the week prior to 4th of July). Being an Omni Select member, I expressed my dissatisfaction and insisted that I would only be happy if fully compensated for the nights that were interrupted by the alarms. I know others reviewed this hotel and were very unhappy with the fire alarm situation, but to tell you the truth, the hotel did deal with it well - in my situation - maybe becauseI was more assertive in expressing what I expected of them! Thus, I am still rating the Omni 5 stars, and I hope the they have corrected the faulty alarm system, so that no one has to experience being evacuated without just cause. In summary, I would give this advice to my fellow travelers: If you are at all dissatisfied with a stay, be professional and polite and express yourself. If you don't get the answer you are looking for, make sure you are dealing with the manager. If you still don't get the answer you are looking for, write to a manager in the corporate office. That usually works, especially if you are a frequent guest of that particular hotel chain.\n",

The hotel has a \"family\" feel to it, although there were singles there as well. The pool was great, right in the middle of the courtyard. And, late in the afternoon, a staff member comes and offers lemonade and popsicles to the people in and around the pool - free of charge! Upon arrival to Magic Castle, the reception staff offer champagne flutes with lemonade in them. Breakfast is complimentary and quite adequate - cereals, fruit, pastries, bread, spreads, coffee, juice, etc. Soft drinks and snacks are available at the front desk, any time of day, and are also complimentary!\n",

      "What made the Magic Castle Hotel so special to us was the staff. On our second last day, we found out that our pet cat (we've had her 12 years) was very ill and would probably pass away at any moment. I informed the front desk staff that we would have to check out a day early and they were very understanding. A few minutes after I had gone back to my room, one of the staff knocked on the door and gave us a little card they had made for us, saying they hoped our cat would be alright. They also gave us a little stuffed mouse for her to play with.\n",

I had read some negative reviews on TripAdvisor, so was a bit apprehensive about our stay. From the moment we arrived, though, I saw there was no need for apprehension. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful from the beginning to the end of our stay. The location was fantastic. My husband had suggested we rent a car at the airport, but I told him from what I had read it didn't seem that there was a need for one. He admitted at the end of the weekend that there was not, plus we saved having to pay for parking at the hotel. (Of course we did have the taxi fare each way to and from the airport, also would have to rely on the free shuttle from Sun Studio to Graceland if you didn't have a car and wanted to go there.) The hotel location was perfect for downtown sightseeing - Mudd Island, riverboat cruise, Beale Street all a very easy walk. It was also an easy walk to great restaurants like Flight, and a two name restaurant, second name Suzanne, both of which we enjoyed during our visit. The trolley stops were at the back of the hotel, which made it convenient for transportation to the Civil Rights Museum, farmer's market, other parts of town. I did have a friend who drove me to Graceland, but otherwise there is the free shuttle from Sun Studio (think you can access the timetable online). We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel's complimentary breakfast and thought they had quite a bit to choose from. Wasn't Breakfast at Tiffany's, but still a very nice beginning to the day. Also appreciated computers in lobby with easy capability for printing boarding passes. Our room was also very comfortable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends who want to visit Memphis.\n",

We had our laptop and the internet connection worked great. We thought the pressure in the shower was awesome and the curtains kept the light from coming in so it was super dark in the morning, which we like. It's little things like that that make a big difference. We didn't hear any of our neighbors (we later traveled to 2 other locations and stayed in cheaper hotels where we could hear everything.) The breakfast was fine. The first day there weren't any eggs but everytime afterwards, there were hard boiled eggs. The coffee was delicious and the waffle maker was fun. They had the other usual things, bagels, danishes, yogurt, fruit and juice. We didn't rent a car and had to rely on the buses. The front desk couldn't provide too much assistance on the buses. The shuttle van is good for downtown locations only and the driver was very friendly. I would recommend this place to all my friends.\n",

Greg the door man was very helpful, we were checked in promptly and our room was immaculate. Loved the Gilchrist and Soames toiletries and the shower! Bed was super comfy and the room was spacious. And while there is not an abundance of shops and restaurants in the immediate area, they are not far away. We ate dinner at Hackney's Irish Pub (a recommendation from Greg) which had authentic pub grub and I've only had better fish & chips in England. Greg also suggested a great jazz club on Clark St. called Close Up 2, so we changed for the evening, drank cocktails in the Custom House restaurant and set off for a great night of live music.\n",

Lobby and public areas very nice, handy access to a lower level arcade of shops and restaurants including Wow Bao (Asian fast food, yummy) and a Starbucks (though beware, the Starbucks isn't open on Sunday). They also sell Starbucks coffee and a small selections of prepared foods (pastries and yogurt for breakfast, salads and sandwiches at lunch) in the lobby coffee shop. Hotel restaurant very good and not quite as outrageously expensive as at some higher end properties. Huge corne room had lots of space, great view, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. You get a little bit of noise from the el, even on the 19th floor where I stayed, but it is not loud enough to disturb you unless you are a really light sleeper. Charging $14.95 for wifi in the rooms is outrageous, though st least they provide free wifi in the lobby.\n",

We had a really good conference rate ($220/night) when I made the reservations, but they would not honor the rate for the weekend as well (conference ended on Friday). We got a room on the 33rd floor over-looking the lake and Navy Pier. We were celebrating our anniversary that weekend (they asked if we were celebrating anything) and when we arrived in the room, there was a special treat waiting for us (chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate treates, and some cold beverages for no extra charge). It was a great room with a great view (I'm pretty sure they upgraded us to this room based on our anniversary). It was very clean and well appointed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we slept great every night. The location is great. Right in the middle of everything, but off the beaten path just enough. The service and attitude of the staff was awesome! You could tell they wanted to please you and get you anything you needed. We liked it so much, I called down to try to extend our stay for the additional 2 nights. Not only did they extend it at the same rate, they made several adjustments so that we could stay in the same room! (our room was reserved the other 2 nights and so I at least expected that we would have to move to another room). That kind of hospitality will definitely bring us back to the Swissotel when we are in Chicago again. The conference I attended during the week was also very successful. Highly reccommended for business and pleasure!\n",

We normally go cheap and cheerful and book in to Milford Plaza when in NY but decided to change to the Edison a week before our stay as we had the option of taking a suite for a little more than what we were paying at the Milford. We were not disappointed with this decision. The Milford is currently a building site and would have meant for an awful stay in NY. In comparison, we found the Edison to be peaceful, relaxing, friendly, clean, and an ideal location. As one of our party has not been keeping great health recently, taking a suite was the ideal decision as it meant he was able to relax in much more comfort. Yes, the room was a little dated but you get what you pay for -if I wanted super luxurious, modern quality I would have gone elsewhere and paid three times the price. That said, the suite was clean, comfortable, the bed was soft, the bathroom well stocked and clean, and we really couldn't find fault. I have read reviews on here of construction work going on - I was not aware of any work going on in the hotel, maybe we were just lucky. Will we back? Oh yes. The Milford's loss is the Edison's gain and I look forward to our next stay with great anticipation.\n",

This is just what we wanted. If you want modern and cold this hotel is not for you. It is perfectly located right on the Freedom Trail and central to everything. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I was a little apprehensive having read previous reviews concerning the construction work and the small rooms. Our room was on 14th floor and I can honestly say that the construction work did not bother us at all. In fact, my husband found it very interesting watching the progress of the work from time to time. I really enjoyed the beautiful view of the Boston skyline at one point I could see as far as the river. Yes the work started early in the morning but who goes to Boston to stay in bed! Our room had 2 double beds and plenty of room for all 3 of us. It was a warm and cosy room and spotlessly clean. The complimentary (select guest) coffee and hot chocolate for my daughter left at the door each morning with a complimentary newspaper was a lovely touch. Our room was cleaned each day and towels, soaps etc were all replaced.\n",
      "We had breakfast (buffet $18 and $10 for child) each morning in the beautiful dining room. This was very good value especially when you convert to Euros. The staff were very helpful and welcoming even calling my daughter by her first name after first meeting. This was a wonderful way to start each day! We did not have dinner in the Hotel as there were so many places in Boston we wanted to try. I did see the Menu and it looked good! We had lunch in the Last Hurrah before we left for the Airport . My daughter had a lovely caesar Salad and I had the famous \"chowda\" which was to die for! Again the staff here were very effecient and very welcoming.\n",
      "I was a little concerned that this hotel might be a little dull for our daughter but this was not the case even though she seemed to be the only child around for the first couple of days. She enjoyed every minute of it and even received an Omni Kids Pack which contained all sorts of goodies.\n",

Tucked away off the main stretch of Westwood, the location is homey, but a very short walk to Westwood Village. The front desk and valet were all very friendly and welcoming. The elevators have this cool camera that makes a montage poster of you as you're riding up (although it may catch you slouching and looking like a schlub). \n",

I also got a really cool view of the pool.\n",

The place was clean and modern, food was good, and location is great because of the local malls and highways and only 1/2 hour from downtown with traffic! I've always like hampton inn better because of their breakfast but this place comes in at a close 2nd for the category of hotel class that it is in. \n",

      "BTW, despite it being a cheaper hotel right next to expensive hotels, the other guests were not obnoxious & noisy, and etc. which is what I always worry about. The guests were all different family sizes, races, ages, etc, and all nice! But we did notice the next morning a car's back window was busted out. I have no idea if it was from theft or vandalism, but I'm guessing most likely someone must have left valuables in their car rather than random violence because the area does not seem like that.\n",

      "Text: Corny but accurate. We visit SA frequently as we only live 80 miles north. We've stayed at many Riverwalk hotels and while there's some worthy competitors the Westin is our favorite. The staff is well trained and friendly (unlike a competitor one block east). The spa while under promoted and hidden down a hallway was fantastic.Two thumbs way up to Dora for the wonderful massages! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and of course the heavenly bedding is wonderful. The only negative is that both the pool area and health club are in need of a face lift if not a makeover. The gym has far too much equipment jambed into a small room off the pool. If you use the treadmills (which we both do) you'll feel like a sardine with the stranger next to you being only inches away. I'm a retired pool builder so a little hypersensitive about pool areas but this is a residential size pool serving a large hotel so managing families with guests who like a quieter pool scene is difficult. Perhaps management can come up with a creative solution because if you like to lay around the pool, have a beer and read a magazine then you'll find the half a dozen screaming kids (the parents of which do nothing to control) just a little irritating. The pool area itself is overdue for a serious cleaning. The concrete decking was filthy, some sling chairs need replacement and there were only enough terry cloth covers for about 6 of the chaise lounge chairs. The bartender and bar were nice but Westin needs to give this area some attention because while the hotel is 4 stars the pool area comes in around a 2.5. Unless you spend 100 percent of your stay around the pool you won't be disappointed at the Westin.\n",

Location is good--it's halfway between the F/V (6th and 23rd) and 1 (7th and 28th) subway stops, although the 1 is slightly closer. There are convenience stores, drugstores and restaurants just steps away: CVS and Duane Reade on 6th, Chipotle and BRGR on 7th. I recommend Supermac on 7th just south of 29th: multiple varieties of macaroni and cheese. \n",
      "Received an \"upgrade\" on arrival to a king bed on 14. Small, NY style room, and really tiny bathroom (bathroom even tinier than the ones at the Radisson Lexington). But everything was clean and comfortable. Flat-screen TV with many stations, about 1/3 of which didn't come in. FREE INTERNET! (Wired or wireless--I went with wired--but be sure all the ethernet cables are connected properly.) I had no noise problems--I could only hear people if they were in the hall outside my door. It was super cold during my stay, and it was kind of hard to keep the room warm because the cold kept radiating from the window, but it was better the last day when it got up to freezing. Staff was pretty friendly for a NY hotel, greeting all the guests as they got off the elevators (no long elevator waits, either). The bartender even changed a $100 for me. The only problem I had was one day when I left my room at noon, it was not cleaned when I got back. I called down and someone came right up and changed the towels and made the bed. I appreciated that; I've had hotels tell me I was out of luck before when that happened.\n",

      "Two minutes from the hotel there is a 7 eleven for the small goodies & 1 block away there is a Wholefood supermarket which also does a wonderful selection of cooked foods if you want a lazy night in your room.Opposite the wholefoods there is a local bar Stoneys which does a mean burger & next door the more upmarket Logan Tavern .A lot of people seem to head to Dupont Circle for evening food but there is a great selection of restaurants closer to the Helix on 14th street right up to the buzz of U street.Choices of American,Italian,Thai ,Seafood ,Ethiopian,Chinese etc.The area around the Helix has a nice neighbourhood feel to it which comes alive in the evenings rather than some of the downtown areas that can be very quiet.We certainly enjoyed our stay at the Helix especially with the $109 Hotwire price & loved our holiday in Washington -great city -THANKS.\n",

You are 1 block away from some outstanding bars and restaurants in the area. The parking garage was connected and the blocks are short...not like the long NYC blocks. The hotel is about 5 miles from Citizens Bank Park and in the Arts district where it is clean and safe. As an added bonus, Doubletree is only 1 mile from two of the most famous Philly Cheesesteak places (Pat's and Geno's). Next time I go to Philly I am going to go right for the Doubletree!!!

Over all im happy to recommend it, though, especially if you get a deal on the room. Pros: No. 1 decor and ambience. This was the overriding factor in my view. Paul S. picked up here where he left off at the royalton and paramount. Trendy chic ultra-modern. The lobby, library and main bar are amazing. A lot of the hotel is dark wood with brick in the lobby, but the bar is a riot of color, with an illuminated floor. The entire package makes u feel that staying there is an experience, not like marking time in the generic, dated, boring hyatts, sheratons and marriotts. The people who hang out there are amazing, btw, its all you woud exect from a hip NY hangout. \n",

No. 4 At short notice, I got approx 160 a night, which was about 30% less than the I was getting quoted for the royalton, paramount or either of the \"W\" hotels, that deliver the same kind of ultra modern \"hotel product\". ConsNo.1 THe room really was tiny. Laughable, really. I was travelling solo, so It was ok, and the amenities were fine. Had an iron and board, CD player, safe etc. \n",

I thought that the window was open, the street noise was so loud. And I heard noise from neighboring rooms at times, but it wasnt terrible.No. 4 not enough plug sockets in the room. No. 5 There was an exercise room, but I would have prefered a far better health club.

We joined the Chicago Architectural Foundation since we wanted to go on several walking tours as well as the river cruise. The tours are free to members and the river cruise discounted. All were very informative and enjoyable. We walked 29,000 steps the first day and needless to say needed to tone it down the second day! The Planetarium and Art Institute were fabulous .

      "Title: “Found my new business hotel in NYC!”\n",
      "Text: After a few not so great experiences at the hotel I normally stay at while in NYC, I took advantage of Jetsetter's sale to obtain a room at the Surrey for an unbeatable rate to see if I should make the Surrey my new business hotel. The first thing that raised my eyebrows about the Surrey was that it doesn't have the same buzz as some of the other hotels in its category such as the Park Plaza, St. Regis or Athenee. However, as I came to find, the Surrey was every bit as luxurious as some of the other boutique hotels but without the crowds and traffic.\n",
      "I will say that I probably won't be booking the Surrey when using Jetsetter again because it was a total logistical nightmare. Normally, with my busy schedule it is very hard to follow up on a hotel booking but it seemed that the Surrey was having some major issues with the Jetsetter site because it took at least 7 emails back and forth with the very helpful GM, Spencer to lock down the day I needed as Jetsetter kept saying it was unavailable and would not show the reservation. I was told there were some issues with the hotel's reservation computer system which might have accounted for the glitch.\n",
      "However, once I actually got to the Surrey, all the hassle I went through making the reservation was worth it. I was upgraded to a fantastic room with a small sitting area and plenty of space. The hotel staff couldn't have been any nicer or friendlier. One of the ways I always judge a hotel is by how the staff treats the guests. From the desk clerks to the doormen to the GM himself, you will be treated as a valued guest here and the staff will go out of the way for you if you make a request.\n",
      "The thing that stood out the most to me was the bed. It was amazing ... without a doubt the best bed I've had at any hotel in NYC. It had extremely nice bedding, including one of the nicest down comforters I've seen ... I forgot to ask where I could buy one when I was checking out of the hotel. I was only there for one night during a worldwind schedule, so its too bad I did not get to use it more. There are plenty of pillows as well, which are not too firm or soft.\n",
      "The room is very tastefully decorated. Normally, I do not love grey, white and black color schemes because I feel they are not very warm and semi-depressing however, the Surrey did it right. The room felt classy and comfortable without feeling too blah. The bathroom was also one of the biggest I've had in NYC with a nice shower that had a great double head and awesome water pressure. The marble and mosaic made it feel very classy. The toiletries were nice and plentiful.\n",
      "One thing I did not use that I thought was cool was instead of the nip-sized bottles in the typical mini-bar ... the Surrey offers bottle service in the room. For $45 - $55 you can buy a 350 ml bottle of liquor (enough for 3-4 drinks) and a bartender will come to your room with the mixers, etc. and mix your first round and leave you the accoutramonts for the other drinks you will make. There are about 15 different drinks you can choose to go with depending on the bottle you choose.\n",
      "The location is great. Those who want to be closer to Broadway/Times Square would not want to walk there and back as it took 30 minutes at a fairly brisk pace to make it to Broadway. It is a short cab-ride to that area and they are pretty good about calling you a cab because this hotel is fairly removed from the action, so cabs aren't plentiful. The location is in a residential part of Central Park. 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue are only a 10 minute walk and because it is so close to Central Park, the walk is not bad. I prefer staying here as opposed to staying more in the 'action' because it is very quiet and laid back ... not at all hustle and bustle. It almost feels like being in a residential neighborhood, which is probably why the price is a bit higher than some comparable hotels.\n",
      "I found the rates to be reasonable ... mid-April seemed to be in the $400 - $500 range for a standard room. You could stay at the W for much less, but I wouldn't say the two are comparable in terms of the luxury bedding/service, however the vibe is similar. One thing I didn't like as much is that if you are traveling with a business partner, they do not have many rooms available at the entry level price range with two beds. I was told upon checking in, the only room they had available with two beds was a junior suite, which would cost $795 per night. The regular rate for an entry level room was $495 at the time.\n",
      "I did not use the restaurant or bar at the hotel. The lobby isn't as spacious as it looks on the website, however it isn't as busy as a lot of other hotels, so that isn't really a problem. I did notice that the staff at this hotel do not beg for tips as they do at a lot of the other full service hotels in the area. At many hotels I stay at for business, it seems like one person takes your bags out of the car, one person wheels them into the hotel, one person parks the car and another person takes the bags to the room. I didn't really find that at the Surrey. I was at the Barclay during this trip as well and was literally chased down into the street by a bellman who moved my bags from my room a few hours earlier who wanted to let me know that it was him that moved my bags earlier that morning.\n",
      "If you have some money to spend and enjoy being outside of the action in a more laid back area, the Surrey is for you. I will say that after several years of staying at their nearby rival hotel, I am making the Surrey my new home for business travel in NYC. I would describe my stay here as luxurious and relaxing and thank the staff and GM for making my business/personal trip so enjoyable.\n",

      "You really can't beat the location. It is 2 miles to the San Diego Zoo, 5 miles to Sea World, and Petco park is adjacent to the hotel. There are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The Altitude bar on the top of the hotel is great! We could only go up during the day because we had the kids with us, but it overlooks Petco Park so you can watch the game from there. You can also look into the park from the concierge lounge.\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the concierge floor. I am not sure why we were upgraded other than that my husband is a silver (or maybe gold, not sure) Marriott rewards member, but it was a very nice perk. We got free continental breakfasts and h'ordeuvres, free Wifi, and there was a computer and printer in the lounge that came in handy for printing our tickets for our activities. If you are lucky enough to be upgraded, be sure to get a to go container for your breakfast and you can take it up to the Altitude Sky Lounge and eat your breakfast outside.\n",
      "The room was very nice and clean. The kids loved that the turn down service included rock candy and Oreo cookies each day. I am not sure if this is a perk of being upgraded or if they do this for everyone, but the kids loved it! They also had bowls of candy in the lobby. The only drawback to the room was that there was no refrigerator. The hallway carpets were a little on the dingy side, but other than that I was completely happy with the hotel (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl).\n",
      "The staff was super friendly! Everyone we met from the maid to the valet guys were super friendly and helpful. Outstanding service.\n",
      "If you get a chance to go to a Padres game, I highly recommend it. We're not Padre fans, but it was still fun and the tickets are so cheap that we were able to sit in the 8th row. The kids got to meet some of the players and they will sign autographs. The best part was that it's right next to the hotel so there was not fighting traffic. We also went to Heavenly Cupcake for my son's birthday which is just a few blocks from the hotel. They were really good, but a bit pricey. We ate a Bud's one evening and recommend it. If you are on Foursquare you can check in and get free tater tots. There isn't a kids menu, but they did have chicken tenders and sliders and what kid doesn't love tater tots? My husband also recommends the Strip Club which which is a restaurant where you pick out your own steaks and cook the steaks on a grill. We did not do this on this trip, but he was there a few months ago and said it was neat experience and the food was good. We also found a great breakfast/brunch place called Mary Janes. We loved it. I had a great breakfast burrito and the kids enjoyed the bottomless bowl of cereal and Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.\n",

Another weird thing was the lack of a working fan in the water closet. They manged to isolate it but once it was stunk up it stayed that way until it naturally dissipated. We used the toilets downstairs in the lobby for the stinkers. Also the turn down service was great but I question the linen on the floor beside the beds. We loved that they left us a water bedside too. Again a very nice hotel with caveats. I would give them a four star rating.

I can not recommend this place enough. the friendliest staff you will ever find anywhere. The hotel itself is very clean. I though the room was a fine size considering what i have read. the bathroom was also fine. Only problem was I would have liked it to have air con as when opening the window the smell from the Italian next door was not to pleasant. Rik's cafe was fantastic. Great breakfast and great wine! When we checked out i couldn't believe it when we were told to make full use of the cafe until we had to get the flight. We were also told that if we had a late flight the make sure we came back for the wine and cheese later, even though we were checked out! They were truly amazing. Cant fault anything, location, cleanliness, friendliness, food, everything was great. Try Tony's next door for the best Italian food ever (and apple martinis!) Jimmy's Cornor around the block is an experience. A dive but a fantastic dive! Owned by a professional boxer who serves behind the bar this place has so much atmosphere.

Generally, we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner. The hotel is a very nice hotel. The concierge was great. Meg, was the person we dealt with and she is VERY knowledgeable about everything NYC. The doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi.

Skywalk to the convention center is a added plus didn't have to be out in the heat.. Pool light display was beautiful at night.. Having a Statbuck's was great. Texas Spice has a great buffet and the wait staff was always there with refills and taking the dirty plates away very good service.\n",

      "Text: I made my reservation online at the Bijou because it said that the last person who'd reserved lived in France. Turned out to be an excellent choice, and it is mostly Europeans who seem to stay there. They know bargains, comfort and chic, obviously. The hotel is very well kept up and the staff is friendly, PLUS you get a free breakfast buffet thrown in with your $60 a night double! They also show old movies in a charming little theater, though you won't have time to watch them--the hotel is conveniently located near everything in downtown San Francisco--two blocks to Market Street, three to Powell for a cable car, about the same for Union Square, not to mention many restaurants and all kinds of transportation. Amazing at these prices for a major American city.\n",

      "Text: Everything at this hotel seems slow and staff are nonexistent. Checkin was slow despite an empty lobby, room service doesn't answer, room is ok but ac is a noisy unit like the kind found in motels. This is my second stay and last was the same.\n",

      "Title: “NO ONE SHOULD STAY IN THIS DIVE”\n",
      "Text: To say we were ‘disappointed’ with this hotel would be the understatement of the century. First of all we arrived to find there was no elevator despite having 3 floors in the building, and as we had a lot of luggage this was not much appreciated. The second we walked into the room it was clear we were staying in quite a well kept establishment as they had saved us the hassle of turning doorknobs by ripping them off each door. The beds came equipped with filthy sheets, each sporting brown stains, what these came from we are not sure but one can speculate…\n",
      "The state of the beds was second only to how uncomfortable they were, particularly the fold out bed we were given. This particular bed collapsed as soon as it was unfolded, and upon telling the Manager about it we were given the response: “Yeah, that one’s broken.” Is it? Is it really? My God thank you for enlightening me.\n",
      "After one night the inevitable happened… Cockroaches.\n",
      "This of course didn’t fill us with confidence about the rest of our stay so we decided to capture a roach and show it to the hotel staff to see if they would do anything. Rest assured they were quite helpful, they looked at the Cockroach with a very ‘I’ve obviously seen numerous cockroaches in this hotel before’ look and said “Oh that’s scary.” Needless to say, we will not be going back, and we feel sorry for anyone else that has to endure this hell hole. There are phenomenally better hotels for around the same price even closer to downtown; we strongly suggest you choose one of those.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Title: “Did not even get past the initial phone call ... won't book here”\n",
      "Text: I just called the hotel to ask a couple of questions: I could not find anything on their website if wi-fi was complimentary and I needed to know if wi-fi was only in the lobby/common area or in the rooms also. I have been burned before with this distinction.\n",
      "I called and asked the front desk if there was a charge for internet access. I was told no. (one word answer) So I asked if wi-fi was available in the rooms or if it was just in the common areas. Her response: \"I just told you it was free, what more do you want\"!\n",

When booking the reservation, I knew it wasn't 5 star or anything but was told it was a quality 3 star place and had been recently renovated. However my room definitely had not been renovated (or cleaned for that matter) in a long long time. Don't be fooled by the hotel lobby which is decent the rooms are a nightmare. There were holes and mysterious substances on the walls/carpeting. All of the furniture was broken and stained & looked like it was picked out of a trash dump. The beds only had a thin blanket and sheets and didnt look very clean. The bathroom had what looked like blood stains and was very dirty. The shower flooded the bathroom when it was on. We complained to the staff and were told they could offer us an upgrade for an additional $100, but when I pressed the desk clerk she said that she couldn't guarentee it would be any nicer. It was so bad I was afraid that I was going to catch something from being in the room so my friend and I stayed out all nite just to avoid being in the room. It was the worst hotel experience I've ever had and am shocked the hotel assoc or health dept doesn't shut them down. Dont let the ratings fool you it is a 1-star, maybe 2-star place at best.\n",

On the contrary to other reviews, my bathroom was OK. It could have been worse. As a matter of fact, it was a lot like the dorm bathroom I used in college. Thank God for flip flops and Lysol. The TV was about 20 years old, with bad reception and barely 4 channels. But you don't come to NYC to sit in your room and watch TV. One great thing about this hotel is that if you aren't leaving NY until late in the day, and need a place to store your things, you can pay $1/bag to store them at the hotel. Also, the hotel is in an excellent location, just a block away from Times Square and the 42nd Street Subway. But there are other hotels in the area that offer better service and nice, clean rooms.

The weird thing is, if you sit on the (very comfortable) balcony furniture, you can't see anything because the concrete railing is tall and thick. The room, as noted in other reviews, was nice, but kind of basic. Very nice bed and bedding, and very comfy desk chair, but the bathroom is kind of vintage, and the lighting over the bathroom sink is pretty bad. My room also had studs on the wall where apparently a framed picture once was; gave the room a half-finished look. \n",

Also, in my bathtub, the shower faucet was loose enough that it wouldn't stay put at the chosen temperature; the handle would just slowly sink until the water was scalding. I solved it by wedging a cardboard coffee cup sleeve (from the coffee service) between the handle and the rest of the fixture to stop the thing from sliding down, but sheesh.\n",

The worst part was the trucks. The road next to the Belmont is quite trafficked at night and my wife and I could hear every single one that passed by as if we were lying next to the road. The window shades were retro indeed gave almost no covering so the room never got dark. I got no sleep. The next morning we waited 20 minutes past the time when they had promised breakfast in bed, only to find out it consisted of cold toast, and old fruit.

The hotel also failed to disclose that they charge for parking. It's not about the money, it's about their unprofessional and dishonest attitude.

By 1:00 pm there were at least 40 people waiting at the registration desk ready to check-in. A little after 1:00, we were told that checkin would not be until 3:00. It was requested to speak with the manager. A man came out and I think he said he was the Assistant Manager but I could be mistaken. He told us that the rooms were not ready and checkin would not start until 3:00. MANY unhappy campers!! I suggested that since the checkin process takes a while, perhaps we could take care of that (you know - credit card, etc.) and pick up the room key later. Oh, no, that wouldn't work. Could we get key and not go to room until 3:00? No, couldn't do that. I guess he finally saw our \"mob mentality\" and, perhaps, fearing for his life, he relented and said ok, you can check in but if the room's not clean you'll have to wait. Ok, we agreed to that. Now - expecting this many people and that most would be checking in around the same time so that we didn't miss the first activity, wouldn't you think they'd have several people available for checkin?? Well, you'd be wrong!! There were 2 people checking us in. After about 30 minutes, 2 other ladies showed up to help. One of these was a young lady named Celine. Celine was wonderful. \n",
      "Ok, let me back up a little. We had 21 ladies in our group and when reservations were made months ago, we requested that we all be located on the same floor and that we have one hospitality suite. Well, they had us scattered on at least 3 different floors & maybe more. Celine took some of our names and somehow arranged that most of us were on the same floor; however, the hospitality suite on the second floor was not ready so in addition to being scattered everywhere, our hopitality suite ended up being on the 6th floor (no one ever asked for that floor!)\n",

      "Problems experienced: \n",
      "Electronic Door Lock - card wouldn't open the door; door wouldn't lock when closed.\n",
      "Rooms: air conditioning unit didn't work; toilet paper holder loose in wall and fell out when you pulled on the paper; toilet handle had to be held down several seconds before it would flush and then had to jiggle handle to get water to turn off; bugs found under a mattress (fortunately they were dead and were not bedbugs but ....); bed mattress so sunken in middle that one rolled into an abyss. I could go on and on.\n",
      "Overall: There were 4 elevators but one didn't work and another one some people got stuck on for several minutes because door would not open. One elevator on Saturday, the doors just stayed open and it wouldn't move. Carpets were filthy and worn; walls and tiles, etc. were nasty looking. Ice machine on floor 2 (my floor) didn't work; finally found one vending machine with Pepsi in it that worked (don't remember which floor). OLD television set in my room so didn't even turn on. Someone said they turned theirs on but no reception! Geez!\n",
      "I could keep going but I think by now you understand that this is NOT a place to stay. Room rate was $89 and not worth it. I'd prefer a nice, clean LaQuinta or Springhill or any place else. \n",
      "It's not like all these people just showed up on Friday. They had our reservations for a long time. But they acted as though we'd just unexpectedly walked in off the street.\n",
      "Oh, back to the main reason we were there - line dancing jamboree in their 11,000 sq. ft. ballroom. Well, it seems they decided to refinish the room's wood flooring (which sounds nice, right?) but it wasn't completed and the floor was a disaster!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sticky, rough, etc.\n",
      "PLEASE!! Don't waste your $$ at this place. They should just just the doors and turn out the lights - the party's over!!\n",

Curious if there were more, i lifted the mattress to inspect. Every crevice of the mattress had these small bugs that remind me very much of those bugs that bite you in your sleep crawling around. It reminded me of what happens when you kick over an ant pile and all the ants scurry to the surface. Shaking with disgust, I quickly put my bags outside the room so none of my personal items got infested. I then went back in the room for further investigation to find a significantly large quantity of dead bugs surrounding the edge of the mattress frame and in the corner of the room next to the bed. \n",
      "Now...of course the hotel was very quick to inform me that they were not the bedbugs that every hotel in NYC fears. Any hotel in the country is going to deny having bed bugs because it would be bad for business. Letting the public know they have a bed bug problem would be committing hospitality suicide. They told me they were beetles. They were bed beetles that look exactly like every bed bug image I could find on the internet. They looked like every image I could find from the Cimicidae bug family, which are the small wingless insects that feed by hematophagy - exclusively on the blood of warm blooded-animals. As we are warm-blooded animals, we are ideal hosts for them. \n",

      "All of my stuff is sitting in the lobby and I end up waiting an hour for the manager to come out and chat. They eventually gave me an upgrade to a larger room that they promised was not infested with bugs. However, I ended up simply leaving the hotel. A larger room is not going to help me sleep better at the Standard High Line. Knowing that the hotel is bug free during my stay is what I wanted. With the amount of bugs I saw after lifting the mattress, I would have been eaten alive if I stayed there one night. Fun place to have a drink, maybe.\n",

      "Title: “Tired, shabby and larcenous”\n",
      "Text: My wife and I recently visited NYC. This was my wife’s first visit to the city, so I surprised her with a stay at the Plaza. Unfortunately, the “Plaza Experience” I had hoped to give my wife turned out to be more akin to the experience one might have expected from the NYC of thirty years ago. \n",
      "Before I get into the unpleasant aspects of our stay at the Plaza, let me first mention the things that I like about the Plaza. First, the location is hard to beat. Second, the walk-in shower in our room was the best I’ve ever seen in a hotel: it was large, beautiful, and the water pressure was strong enough to knock over a small elephant. Third, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. Fourth, if you like historical buildings (which my wife and I do) the Plaza has much to offer. Fifth, the staff was, in the main, friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, there were material exceptions to numbers four and five, which I’ll get into in a moment.\n",
      "The traveler should be aware that the famous Oak Room is not open for business. The website does not make this clear unless you actually attempt to make an online reservation. \n",
      "The traveler should likewise be aware that the “Rose Suite” is not, in fact, a suite, but instead a large, oddly-shaped room with a great deal of wasted space. To be fair, the website does include a floor plan of the suite, so I did not rent the room in complete ignorance of what I was getting; nevertheless, “suite” generally indicates a bedroom and sitting room separated by a wall. One gets the sense that the Plaza is a tired property trading on its name and prior reputation, and this sort of hucksterism is indicative of that unfortunate reality. \n",
      "The room featured an iPad which we were supposed to be able to use to control the air conditioning in the room and check our account balance, among other features. Unfortunately, the aforementioned features, which were the ones in which I was most interested, never worked, engineering’s best efforts notwithstanding. \n",
      "Upon our arrival, I asked where the gym was and was told it was “under construction.” Again, there was no indication of this on the website. As things stand today, the Plaza’s idea of a gym is two treadmills, one elliptical machine and a set of free weights stuffed into a tiny guest room on the 19th floor. There is one television in the room, which is inexplicably located behind the treadmills and elliptical. The treadmills and elliptical do not have the usual built-in television, which means that a typical La Quinta has better exercise equipment than the Plaza. Thanks to this carefully-planned arrangement, the people on the treadmills get to look at the building across the street while those (like me) who prefer the elliptical, get to look at the wall. Marvelous. On the second day of our stay, I arrived at the gym at around 7:15 am to find that there were no towels. I called the front desk and asked for some towels. Evidently, I was not the first person who had called, since the woman at the front desk sounded annoyed and said that someone was “on the way” with towels. The towels finally arrived around 20 minutes later. \n",
      "While the Plaza is an interesting historical building, its interior was surprisingly tired and even shabby at points. The carpet on the guest floors is faded and badly in need of replacement, and there are many places which cry out for a simple paint touch-up. That these basic maintenance items have not been addressed is odd, to say the least. \n",
      "All of the above left the impression that the Plaza is a fading and indifferently-managed property. Given the amount of money they charge for lodging, this fact was irritating, but tolerable, even though I’ve stayed in MUCH nicer hotels in the neighborhood for MUCH less. However, the experience I am about to describe is beyond the pale. The day before we arrived, I called the concierge and asked them to place a pallet of bottled water in our room. My expectation was that they would run out to a nearby market and get me a case of water, as this has been my experience with the exact same request at other hotels in the neighborhood. When I arrived, there was no water at all in the room. So, I went down to the concierge desk, recounted the conversation I had had the day before, and asked again for a pallet of bottled water. The concierge said they would be happy to comply. When we returned that night, there were 24 bottles of water in our room. When it came time a few days later to check out, I noticed a room service charge for $288.00. Since we had not ordered room service, I questioned the charge, at which time they showed me the ticket, which revealed that the $288.00 was the charge for the 24 bottles of water. For those of you not inclined to do arithmetic in your heads, that’s $12.00 per bottle. I explained that I had expected the concierge to run out to a market and pick up a case of water for me, not send me bottles from room service in order to gouge the crap out of me. After much conversation, the manager finally agreed to reduce the charge by 30%, and promised she would talk to the concierge and get the situation resolved. The “resolution” I got was the following email:\n",
      "Dear Mr. Warr,\n",
      " We sincerely hope you and Mrs. Warr had a wonderful stay with us, and return trip home was uneventful.\n",
      " I have just spoken with Guest reception manager regarding your request for a case of water. As a hotel concierge, we always order from In room dining when guests order food or beverages unless otherwise specifically requested.\n",
      "I am sorry if you had something else in mind when we spoke. It is absolutely my intention to fulfill the request in the way you would like. Once again, I apologize if there was a misunderstanding.\n",
      " We look forward to welcoming you back to the Plaza Hotel New York. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any additional assistance.\n",
      " Regards,\n",
      "Well, gee, thanks, but you’re still charging me $8.40 for a bottle of water. (For those of you out there who hate math, that’s $12.00 less 30%.) NYC used to have the reputation of a place where out-of-towners would get ripped off and swindled; thankfully, the city has done much to free itself of this perception over the last thirty years. It is unfortunate that, among the many excellent traditions a venerable institution like the Plaza might choose to uphold, they have chosen to uphold one that is so unsavory and unethical. \n",
      "There are several hotels in the neighborhood which are less expensive, have better rooms, nicer amenities, and, most importantly, policies designed to serve the guests, not cheat them. The next time I come to the city, I’ll be staying at one of those places. I’ll never be back to the Plaza\n",

We called the front desk to ask if they could just go get it really quick and solve the issue right there. We were just transferred to different phone lines and voicemails that told us they would get to it in 24-48 hours. We talked to numerous people who all sounded like they were reading off of a flow chart in dealing with it. If they would have just treated us like a human and actually listened to what we were saying, then it could have been solved in minutes. Instead, it has been over a week and we have not and probably will not receive a response on the ring. It was a ring that belonged to my girlfriends mother who passed away. Greektown still says the same exact thing and send us to a voicemail in the security office to this day. Not ONE person from Greektown has looked up from their script and felt bad in anyway possible.

      "Title: “Horrible Experience”\n",
      "Text: I recently stayed at the Hotel Serrano for Labor Day weekend, along with my boyfriend and another couple. We had a horrible experience with this hotel and it's staff. We not only made a reservation, but had Pre-Paid it in advance. We originally booked 1 room with 2 double beds. We also arranged for a late check-in, since we would be driving up from Los Angeles after work. We had confirmation online, as well as over the phone a few days earlier. When we arrived at the hotel at 2 in the morning after an extremely long drive, we were not greeted by any staff. We then proceeded to check in at the front desk, when the staff member simply looked at us and said, \"Nope. There's 4 of you, but we only have you down for a single room with 1 bed.\" We disagreed, and explained that we had Pre-Paid for a double room. We even showed him the itinerary and invoice we had printed online. He just shook his head and said, \"Nope.\" He told us that all of their double rooms have been booked. He never apologized, and even got defensive saying that this was not the hotel's fault. He did not try to accommodate us at all for their mistake. When we were about to leave, he hesitantly offered us 2 separate smoking rooms. We definitely did not want to take the smoking rooms, so he then offered a suite..but we would have to pay the difference in price. Why should we have to pay more for a suite after they gave up the room that we had already reserved AND paid for?! So fine, we were so tired, we just agreed to stay in the separate single rooms for that night. The next morning, after talking to the manager of housekeeping, we were moved to a double room with 1 bed and a sofa bed (which we had to call down to the front desk again because we had no blankets/pillows for the sofa bed). For our inconvenience, they also gave us a voucher for a continental breakfast for 2, even though there were 4 of us. Whatever. When we went to redeem our voucher in the morning, their restaurant had closed early without any notice, so we were not able to get our breakfast. Lastly, upon checking out, we noticed that they had charged us an extra $120 for a late check-in! We had already arranged for a late check-in prior, and had already paid for everything in advance, but they still tried to charge us when we were leaving!! Our stay was a complete disaster, and not a single staff member was at all apologetic for their mistakes, or friendly at all for that matter. DO NOT STAY AT THE SERRANO. They treated us as if we were trying to get something for free, when all we wanted was what we had paid for! They did not want to honor our PRE-PAID RESERVATION, and we had to fight to get a mediocre room without paying extra.\n",

      "Text: My husband and I stayed at the W Downtown, NYC on September 16-18, 2011. I really don't know how to explain our experience. We arrived late because we were driving from the Boston area. When we arrived, we were greeted cordially by a doorman and escorted to the lobby on the 5th floor.\n",
      "When we arrived on the 5th floor, there was an incredible blast of music! The music was somewhere between disco and rap. My husband and I owned a discotheque for six years, so we were not too shocked. What were disconcerting were the lights on the curved ceiling that reflected off the floor. The experience was not good. We had to navigate to the next set of elevators. The optical Illusion was not comfortable; we felt like we were drunk. \n",
      " At first, we thought since we're older than the target demographic, we couldn't make a fair evaluation. However, after talking with young people (late twenties to forties), they felt the same way. They told us that they were upset and disoriented by the lights, music, and layout of the hotel. \n",
      " Our room 2211 was clean but extremely small. The bed was very comfortable and probably the best part of our stay. The bathroom had very little space. There was nowhere to put a toothbrush or any cosmetics. Maybe, this would be a great room for a single business person. If you would like to see how you look before proceeding to a meeting, you would wonder, where is the mirror? It's on the backside of the closet door. If you open the closet door, lean against the other door, and you're really thin you might be able to see yourself. \n",
      " We stayed at the W in Boston, and it was one of the best experiences in our lives. The \"W\" NYC Downtown needs to take a look at what other \"W\" hotels do. \n",

      " Our advice to the \"W\" Downtown is to:\n",
      "1. Expand your target demographic and redesign the lobby and guest rooms to meet the needs of a more diverse clientele. All guests whether they are 20 or 60 want a quiet, clean, comfortable place to relax. I believe all travelers, business people, and tourists want the same thing. \n",
      "2. Put a shelf in the bathroom so guests can store their toiletries. \n",
      "3. Install a full-length mirror on the outside of the closet door.\n",
      "4. Repaint in the guestrooms and hallways—this would freshen up and brighten up these areas. \n",
      "5. Work out a plan with the cab companies to actually come down the street for customers. Your doorman told us to just go take the subway!\n",
      "6. Visit some great hotels in the area like the Andaz and Gild Hall to pick up some pointers.\n",
      "7. Rearrange the elevator configuration. Going up five floors to the lobby is not a good plan. Guests should not have to wangle their way from the check-in desk, go across the dance floor, and walk in front of the DJ to get to the next bank of elevators which will eventually take them to their rooms.\n",
      "8. Tone down the elevator music. Find music that is appealing to all. \n",
      "9. Supply the correct email address when sending out a survey. GMWolfgang.Wehen@whotels.com is not a valid email address. The email gets returned. Remove the GM—we called to get the correct address.\n",

Having read a few alarming reviews here regarding noise level and elevators being painfully slow, I dismissed them as coming from people who probably complain a lot. Now I regret not taking those reviews into consideration more carefully.\n",
      "I booked a deluxe room through United.com and requested two beds (costing me more than $320/night). Upon arrival, I was informed that the rooms with two beds were not available, but there was a pullout couch in our room. This was not ideal, but satisfactory. The room we were given was on the 3rd floor and upon entering it, I knew exactly what the poor reviews of this hotel were about as the noise level was excruciating. I felt like we were outside, that's how loud it was! I believe one of the problems is poorly installed windows as they leaked both noise and air. Then I noticed small hairs on the bathroom floor - not the cleanliness level I expect for more than $300/night. \n",
      "Having barely survived the first night due to constant earsplitting noise from the outside and loud A/C unit inside, we went to take an elevator downstairs to eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant the next day. There were a few people already waiting for an elevator for more than 10 minutes at that point. A few minutes later, a man came down by stairs from the 20th floor because he was tired of waiting for an elevator. However, he had to exit the staircase on the third floor because there was no exit to the lobby from the stairs. I didn't believe him and took the stairs on the other end of the building trying to find the way out. The door to the lobby was locked there too. We returned to the third floor and I called the front desk for suggestions as to how we could get out since two elevators that stopped during the 20-minute wait period were full. The employee said that we could not get down through stairs (which is a violation of a fire code) and our only option was to wait for an elevator (which was not option at all since they would not stop on our floor or arrive fully crowded). In the end, we had to take an elevator that was going upstairs (to the 27th floor) and then slowly come down wasting at least 30-40 minutes on the whole process. The same scenario repeated two days later. On several occasions, the elevator would not even stop on the 3rd floor when going up, thus again adding more time and painful frustration to our trip. \n",
      "Now I would like to comment on the quality at the hotel restaurant - it is mediocre at best. I had scallops for dinner the first night and they still had sand on them (i.e. not thoroughly washed) and breakfast dishes the next day were tasteless. Now I understand why hotel guests are offered 20% off at the restaurant. Do not eat there as there are plenty of superb restaurant options within walking distance on the 8th avenue and 46th Street.\n",
      "But this is not the final list of my complaints. When the temperature outside dropped, we could not get the heating system in our room to work. An engineer came by and tried to fix it to no avail, and then he brought a cover for the window AC unit because he saw how much air that window was leaking and also brought us a space heater. I have to say he was the only staff member who displayed a concern for the situation we were in.\n",
      "Upon checkout, I expressed all the complaints stated here to the front desk and was offered to deduct $70 off my bill. I thought this was a poor attempt to compensate for truly dreadful experience during our stay as it definitely spoilt what was supposed to be a fun weekend.\n",

      "To Management: There is no excuse, not one, ever, to have a mouse, cockroach, or other bug infestation and fail to act or disclose it. Employees who pretend not to notice problems, or fail to report problems to managers, suggest corporate culture issues. Minimizing problems and their effect on guests is not only arrogant; it is insulting. Denying there is a problem at all, when photographs exist, everyone is looking directly at the problem (mouse droppings, wet soap mush in the tub, black filthy floors, cockroaches, etc) and when clearly, the problem is recurring, is dishonest. Failing at least to appear, act, fake, or pretend to be interested in a guest's unhappy and disgusting experience, is unconscionable. Lastly, failing to contact unhappy guests, regardless of loyalty, or whether they carry HH cards, especially when a guest specifically requests it, is a sign of utter contempt. \n",
      "Nota bene: An online posting that starts with a template stating \"We are disappointed\" or \"We are saddened\" or \"We apologize for...\" is unnecessary, and its sincerity inherently suspect. A bellman already informed us not to expect anyone to care about our nightmarish experience unless we post in Trip Advisor. Another employee told us that the GM faithfully reads the Trip Advisor reviews and responds because the reviews are public. This is the same manager who never contacted us while we were there and still has not bothered to call.\n",

      "Text: If you want a good nights sleep don't stay here! As our apartment was having some renovation work done, we decided to go to Seattle for 2 nights to get away from the noise. I arrived with my daughter to a long line at check-in, I didn't mind as we were not in any rush. Went to the room, which was a non-smoking room, to find cigarette butts on the ledge ouside the window, along with two behind the bin in the room. Room 232 has plumbing problems I think! All night you could hear a splash/drip loudly, and due to the thin walls you could hear next door and upstairs flushing the toilet non-stop. There was someone upstairs above us who spent the whole night pacing up and down, and you could hear it quite loudly - possibly because this is an old creaky hotel/inn, or possibly because the person was walking heavy - either way we didn't sleep at all.....At 4.30am I couldn't stand the noise any more from the plumbing, so went to the lobby and explained the situation. They said they would change the room, but had to wait until housekeeping had been to assess the vacant room situation. At 8am, after 3.5 hours sitting in the lobbly, the guy on the desk gave me a new key to another room in a wallet that said check in time 4pm.....so waited until 10am (now 5.5 hours sitting in the lobbly) until he asked if there was something more he could do. I explained I was waiting until we could go to the room at 4pm....he said sorry for the misunderstanding, all their wallets said 4pm but the room was free now! So, went to the room, it wasn't very clean, dusty, gum on the bedpost, bath had bits of fluff and stuff in it, carpet very stained, and smelt very damp. I opened the window and there was a bad smell, looking out, there was a very soiled diaper on the window ledge, as well as more cigarette butts! I went down to tell them about the diaper, which they removed quite fast and I didn't get a chance to take a photo. Well, we went to see a movie that night and got back at around 11.30pm, got washed and ready for bed, and at 12.30am went to sleep. We were woken at 2am by so much noise outside the room. I looked out of the spyhole to see about 8 people outside our door, shreiking and laughing, one woman was shouting at her kids. It looked like they were just checking in (yes at 2am!) so I left it for an hour but couldnt take it anymore, I was just so tired. I called the lobby and explained that it was so noisy and could they possibly ask them to keep the noise down. I was told that there was a party of 11 people checking in and that if its too noisy I could change rooms. I said I didnt want to be disrupted anymore, and she was very 'off' with me, and said these people are checking in so if I dont like it I should move rooms. Well, these people had at least 3 rooms between them, and they were running from door to door, slamming them...total nightmare. So disrespectful of these people but more so because sixth avenue were not interested in asking them to keep the noise down. She said she would send security up, but that didn't happen. I must have dropped off to sleep for half an hour, because at 4am I get a phone call from the lobby to say \"your pizza is here\" ??? confused, I said \"what pizza\" she said again \"your pizza delivery is here\", followed by, sorry ma'am wrong room!!! I must have dropped off again, because the room telephone rang again, but when I answered they hung up - wrong room again I wonder?? So, at 5.10am, loud door banging again, so many doors banging, I looked through the spyhole again to find they are all in the corridoor argueing over sharing the pizza's.....the noise was so bad, even with ear plugs, you could hear everything. At 5.30am I decided I couldn't take anymore, yes, I was crying, I was so tired, and only came away to get some rest......I slept in our hire car, and with all the traffic outside, it was still quieter than the hotel room. On leaving/checking out, I ensured they knew what had happened, even though most of it had been registered, and felt I should not have to pay the bill. I seriously felt they should have paid ME for putting me through so much. The lady on the desk - Maria Dianga - waved the parking charge, but I still had to pay for the room for 2 nights. I signed the bill to say it had been \"paid under protest\" She took everything down in detail and said she was unable to authorise complimentary rooms, and that she would speak to her manager. She gave me her card, and told me that as it was a Friday, I wouldnt hear anything until the Monday, they have my email address and phone number for contact. I heard nothing, and it is now nearly 2 weeks and I have heard nothing. I will be taking this up legally, and contacting my credit card company to obtain a refund. So, if you dont mind staying up all night, dont mind dust everywhere, dont mind if people are smoking in their \"all non-smoking rooms\" and a couldn't care less attutude....go ahead and book. Also, ask for another blanket before you go to sleep, there is one very old bobbly blanket, that has seen better days. The one possitive is that this Inn is very central and accessible. I am attaching some photo's I took of the room, there is a lot of mould on the windows, so allergy sufferers might want to consider this, unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to picture the filthy diaper. I'm very sorry to have to write such a negative report, but I feel it is important for people to know that it is so noisy.\n",

      "Text: We stayed at the Park Central between March 25th - 29th 2005. We were a party of four and as two of of party required separate beds our travel agent called and asked about booking two rooms as we wanted one with twin beds and our booking was made on that basis. We booked two rooms one with any type of bed the other with twin beds. The four night break cost more than $2000. When we arrived we were told that we had been allocated two one bedded rooms. We queried this and to cut a long story short the lovely check in clerk called the front desk manager and after quite a wait a portly man popped his head out, tapped a few keys on the keyboard and in true Little Britain style said 'The computer says NO' well actually he just said NO. In fact he said we don't actually have any twin rooms in the hotel- none at all, not none available, none at all. So I asked why had they had accepted our booking when they couldn't fulfil it and he just shrugged his shoulders. I said to him that it was showing as a confirmed booking for twin beds and he said that no beds are guaranteed until check in. I asked him to refund our money so that we could find a hotel with twin beds and he said No - we had made a confirmed booking and it was non refundable!!!\n",
      "We were allocated rooms on the 25th floor, one was quite large the other very small. In the small room they added a rollaway bed - all this money and one guest gets to sleep on a rollaway.. It could have been worse as when we were checking in a couple with two strapping teenage lads were also told that their room would have one kingsize bed and a rollaway. I wonder how Dad got on sleeping with his lads.\n",
      "The largest of our rooms seemed to have a bathroom designed for disabled access. The bathroom was approximately 10' x 8' and one third of this was tiled with a shower. There was no curtain and the floor was very uneven and cracked. When the shower was used it flooded the whole room and from the skirting board and carpet in the bedroom it was clear that it had flooded reqularly. The shower was really weak and very disappointing.\n",
      "In addition to the shower there was a sink and toilet, no shelves, no counter, no cupboards in short no where to put a toothbrush or toiletries. There was no where to put this in the room either so it was put in with the television as this was the only place with a shelf.\n",

      "Text: I normally don't bother with reviews but this stay I felt needed one. I always check out trip advisor reviews before booking with a hotel and they have never steered me wrong. However, this hotel was a huge disappointment. I usually take the bad reviews with a grain of salt if there are numerous good reviews. Well, I should have listened to the bad this time. First off, all staff that I encountered (except for a young lady that had only been there 4 months) were rude. We booked through expedia which advertised \"free shuttle, free continental breakfast\" at a special rate (which was $3 less than the sign outside the hotel when we arrived). We were given a room on the ground floor on a saturday night at about 8pm. We were surprised at the amount of people out in the halls and outside but we figured it would calm down. No such luck...folks were making all kinds of noise all throughout the night. There were a lot of young couples making out in the parking lot and with the mirror over our bed and the extremely small room, it made me wonder if there aren't a lot of \"hourly\" stays here. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and with all the noise, we were not able to sleep one wink. the small uncomfortable room with the hard bed did look clean but there was something splattered all over the mirror headboard (like soda or food or something) that made me wonder if they really cleaned the rooms ever. We were only staying for one night so we could leave the next morning for a flight to disney world. When we checked in we told the girl that we had requested the shuttle service for 7am. She said ok and wrote our names on some sort of list- not a problem. Also asked what we would have to do to get the shuttle back to the hotel and she replied- just call the hotel and we'll take care of it. Ok. Well, the next morning no one was at the front desk...we later found out he was the one setting up breakfast. When I asked him about the shuttle, he did come out and call the driver to wake him up. I also asked him if we just called them or how the process worked to get picked up. He said to just call. He was very short with everyone he spoke to. He was very strange (can't describe him) Anyway, there were 5 of us already out there waiting for him (he was supposed to be out there at 7am). The driver finally showed up at 7:30 to give us a ride (pretty darn tired looking). He must have also not gotten any rest from all the partying going on in the halls the night before. Anyway, we got the ride to the airport and there were no lines so no problems getting to our 9:30 flight on time. The real problem was when we returned. I called the hotel to get the shuttle back to where my van was parked. All of a sudden they have no record of me even staying there. Then the lady on the phone finally finds it and says \"oh, you booked through expedia so you shouldn't have been allowed to park and shuttle without upgrading to our price\" She also called my price \"extremely discounted\" even though it was only $3 less than the advertised price on their signage and it was I am pretty sure the crappiest room they had available. After hearing I might have to pay double what I paid to get back to my van which was already parked at the hotel, you can imagine I was pretty irrate. So I did mention to her that I got a discounted rate for a crappy room. She insisted that I had to pay the fee that the 2 employees before should have mentioned to me and made me pay before I left my van there. She asked that I pay that fee when I got back to the hotel and since I finally agreed, she did go ahead and have the shuttle man pick me up since he was already there picking up another couple. But she was pretty rude about it. Also, if you have small children you should know that the shuttle is more of a small minivan. I didn't think to bring a car seat for my two year old son bc I didn' know this. Next time I will ask the hotel what kind of shuttle. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend staying here at all but if you still decide to...just know that you will probably pay way more money than advertised. I watched a couple check in that morning and the cost ended up being $70 without any kind of park and ride service. The sign outside advertised $49.99 but with taxes and fees the front desk guy told them it was $70. Anyway, this review may not sound too bad to some and I guess I should have known better than to try to save a little money. However, after these reviews I felt like it would be a good place to stay for one night. Boy was I wrong. Nothing was as advertised and how can it be a good place for one night when everyone is making noise all night? No consideration at all. It was a horrible way to start our vacation...I should have just waken up at my house at 3am and driven 3 hrs to the aiport myself...it would have been better than paying for this hotel and not even getting to sleep there. Just not good experiences...I just want to save others from having similar experiences. Oh and the lady that made me pay extra was dissing expedia like crazy and I have always booked through them with no problems whatsoever. On the positive side, since we were standing in the lobby for 30 minutes waiting for the driver of the shuttle bus...I did manage to get a bagel to eat and get some fruit loops and juice for my son. The breakfast didn't start until 7 (a little after) though on the weekends. I'm wondering if those folks with good reviews stayed during the weekday and if that makes a difference. Maybe an upper level larger room, I don't know. But I will say that when we got there I kind of felt like the lady who wrote she didn't feel safe in this hotel. It was just the people hanging out in the hallway and the sketchy people walking up and down the road around the hotels. I kinda wondered if my van would be safe but the front desk lady just said not to leave anything valuable in it and that they hadn't had to call the cops for any incidents in about 4 months....\n",

My tolerable stay at Country Inn and Suites only slightly spoiled the ambiance, and that's saying something for the charm of Cowtown. My suite was clean and adequate, but the refrigerator was very flimsy and small. There was only one small closet, and the TVs were pretty old. However, these are minor problems.\n",
      " I've stayed in a lot of places, and have never complained, even at one hotel in Corpus Christi with a lot of mirrors and a lot of cockroaches reflected in them (not to mention the flimsy deck that felt as though it might give way at any moment, just like the decks in the tier of rooms next to me with one continuous hole through them from floor four to floor one). Did the victim(s) survive, I wonder? But I digress... Back, alas, to the Country Inn and Suites...\n",
      " Where were my fresh-baked cookies? Nowhere to be seen. The unhappy story begins, however, when I took my first shower. After adjusting the water pressure to a pain-free level, I noticed that most of the shower ended up on the bathroom floor, and the fan did nothing to prevent condensation. I had to mop up the floor and dry the mirror and counter afterward. The bathroom towels were all damp. This might have been prevented if a real shower liner had been put in the room, instead of a flimsy curtain that was never meant to be waterproof, and clung to me so much I was sorry I hadn't made my introductions before we had gotten so intimate. The trick, I discovered, was to thoroughly wet the bottom of the \"curtain\" so that it would leave me alone, and hug the side of the tub instead. This helped to keep some of the water in the bathtub and not on the floor. It was late at night, however, and after my aquatic workout and cleaning the bathroom, I was thoroughly wrung out. Only an exasperated call to Management was going to make me feel better. Or was it?\n",
      " After explaining the problem to a desultory night-clerk, the phone was handed to a brisk and efficient-sounding manager. She couldn't have sounded less concerned with my problem, and informed me that somehow my shower-taking skills were inadequate. All of the rooms had these so-called shower curtains, and she really saw nothing wrong with them. The fault lay in my woeful shower-taking skills, not their faulty curtains. Why, she had never heard of such a problem! I suggested she take a shower herself in one of her wonderful bathrooms, with the fan running, and see if she didn't herself have a miserable experience. Since there was a convention in town, and I couldn't reward Management's attitude by finding another hotel, I remedied the problem by buying my own shower curtain the next day. I had to make a second call for dry towels.\n",
      " On the positive side, the rooms were clean, maid-service was friendly and prompt, and the pool was very pleasant. Late-night swims were a real pleasure. Just don't expect to stay in the shower for more than a few agonizing minutes, and expect the bathroom to be drenched, unless you ask for room 120, the only room with a \"real\" shower curtain.\n",

We asked for our money back, they said they will file a report and if the exterminator determine’s it is in fact bedbugs they will refund our money BUT if it is any other insect they would not. These people are NUTS! Since it was Friday the exterminator would be called on Monday. They have no intention of letting me know of the outcome, not that I expected they would. But I did call the Health Department first Monday morning so I know a formal complaint was filed. I WILL NEVER EVER, EVER STAY THERE AGAIN! ROOM #1570 15th floor.\n",

      "Text: I will never stay here again! I booked a room (with occupancy 4) (2 weeks in advance) through priceline. I called to confirm the reservation, and that we would have a room with 2 beds. Once checked in, we were put in a room with 1 bed, for 4 people. And then told that they saw a request for 2 beds, but if I wanted 2 beds I had to pay an additional $20 plus tax. I requested to speak with a supervisor, because I know they cannot put 4 people in a room with 1 bed. The person working the desk refused to contact a supervisor. I ended up paying the additional money, only because I had prepaid the room through priceline and could not walk away without losing my money. I paid more than what an average night would have cost, and the hotel was definitely not worth the price. Another good thing to know, breakfast ends at 9AM, not 10AM. Myself and everyone else who thought it ended at 10AM were treated so rudely when we showed up for breakfast a little before 9.\n",

The room and bed was clean and no sign of bugs (as I have seen reviews complain about) but walls were a little dirty and drywall was cracked in a few places. On the down side - room had no coffee maker (coffee only at breakfast), no microwave either but there was a community MW for use (a bit of a joke really) and it seems you have to ask for extra toilet paper. It does have a fridge. The breakfast donuts were not appetizing at all. Staff friendly for the most part, depending on who was staffing the front desk. I would stay here again if I couldn't find better digs for the price. The neighborhood is not great but when you're on vacation and the sights are Hollywood, etc, you don't wander the neighborhood anyway so it shouldn't really be a factor.\n",

Anyway after 2 hours we still hadn't got our room, so went up to reception and they agreed we could check into our room, but told us there would be someone coming up to fix the light.

I'm sure the hotel fulfills the local health codes but if you are looking for even a bit of comfort and a clean bed I would suggest you look elsewhere.

Voice mail left, name and number included, wishing to be contacted to discuss the whole situation, Mr. Malone simply blew me off. No call of explanation, nothing. Now it seems to me that if I hadn't given them the courtesy to cancel prior to my arrival date, I would have been charge for the stay. That kind of sounds like a contract, doesn't it. Well, the same can't be said for management, your confirmation number doesn't mean squat to them.

Instead I was hassled and basically told I was a liar about the agreed upon rate by the general manager. On my second day I was contacted to leave the hotel 3 times. I explained I booked for 2 nights and confirmed again my rate.\n",
      "Upon leaving the general manager looked at the note about my rate, noticed the exact agreed upon amount I mentioned yet INSISTED there was a mistake. I told him I was responsible for the amount above my already paid hotwire and he said the assistant manager who was not there should not have provided my lower rate. He then proceeded to bill me over $100 ABOVE the rate HE SAW IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. When I approached him about this twice he said the assistant manager was not there and that until he figured out why I received such a low rate he would be forced to charge my credit card. I mentioned again my two colleagues actually stayed through hotwire for a rate even lower and that I was willing to pay more just not the $100 more he was trying to charge me. I also mentioned hotwire was on the phone to confirm and he even has a note in system with the agreed upon rate. He said it is \"complicated\" because the manager should not have had the authority to do this. Essentially after the second time I stated it is an internal problem with the hotel and that he was essentially saying he did not believe the other managers note. His response was that he would not bill my credit card until later that day and confirm with the manager. So when I left I was charged over $100 above what was agreed and he wasted over 30 minutes of my time trying to explain this. I had an afternoon business meeting and left without continuing to argue since it was clear he was going to charge my card anyway. \n",
      "Terrible customer service. In addition the hotel was not that great. The bathroom is weird and the shower points straight at your face so I basically had to duck to wash my hair. The entire hotel is very snooty. On the first night at the supposed \"hot spot\" rooftop bar the bartender told us the next night would be \"off\" and the greatest place in San Diego and there would be a line, but since we were in the hotel we would be good with wristbands. Well good thing we had wristbands for the lame 25 person scene the next night. When we asked him he was like, well come back on the weekend sorry!

      "Text: Where do I begin? We chose the Marcel to celebrate our 3rd anniversary. Booked through Expedia for 3 nights - and got treated second class the minute we arrived. This was our first and last trip to NYC - we are hesitant to go again. First, the room was stifling hot and looked like a college dorm. They came twice to try and fix the window a/c unit, leaving a sharp metal filter sticking half way out. The front desk clerk, who called himself the 'manager\" (later found out he was not) lied to us about having no other rooms available. Rather than give us another room, the clerk suggested we cab it to one of their sister hotels across the city - even though we had prepaid for 3 nights at the Mercer! Well we had it out with him at the front desk and he became more arrogant by the minute. But after I nearly passed out from the heat, we were shown 2 available rooms, with A/C only 2 floors up. Now, don't even try to disturb the front staff when they are talking to their friends on cell phones...\n",
      "So, our new room, was 'better' - we were moved around 11:30 pm. However, that same night, we were awakened bysomeone slamming the doors in the hallway and oh yes, bed bugs! Paper thin walls, some rooms with A/C, some rooms with bugs - wow! \n",
      "I tried to open the curtain only to see bird droppings all over the window, and we were looking out onto the main A/C unit (ironic since we had no a/c in the first room!). . Whenever we asked for help in directions or recommendations as to where to go, we were given no help whatsoever. We were even told 'no, we don't have a cork screw' by the same idiot at the front desk, only to have someone else bring one up. Talk about personal! \n",
      "Then, our room was supposedly 'cleaned' but they left our wine glasses dirty (we needed lots to survive our experience - we basically avoided the hotel for anything but sleep) they didn't clean those, so we returned to a room FULL of fruit flies and spent the entire evening trying to get rid of them.\n",
      "It was the most horrendous experience - and I've stayed in 1 star hotels in Europe better than this! When we asked for a room change or refund, we were told 'deal with expedia, you booked through them' so we had no choice but to endure it all. Well, we did follow up and Expedia refunded us 1 night stay based on our horrific experience there. \n",

We moved hotels and called the car service, only to be told it would arrive in roughly 90 minutes. This was supposed to be the cap-off of a long 10 day vacation, and it turned out to be a horrible experience.

The room was still worn, however, and the tub didn't work properly. We had to wedge one of their bars of soap in the drain to keep it open so that the water would drain while we showered the next morning. Anyway, I didn't notice any more bugs and we went to sleep, although I was never truly comfortable all night and kept worrying about waking up with roaches crawling on me. The room (another on the ground floor) was noisy with cars pulling in at night, some with loud radios. We also had someone loudly knock on our door at 5:30 am (it was the wrong room), but I guess that wasn't the hotel's fault. The next morning we got up and found two baby roaches in the bathroom. Luckily, we were checking out. I told the guy at the front desk and he said that they try to keep them out but all of San Diego has a roach problem. Hmmm.

You would have thought they would have made some kind of note on our account to make sure that our every need was taken care of for our visit. Not the case. Called room service and asked for a bottle of champagne. The rep said that she didn't have the liquor cabinet key, and she wasn't going to be able to do that for us. Not one attempt to resolve the situation, or just say of course, and figure it out on her own. Our room was not properly cleaned. Empty Champagne bottle left in room, chairs askew from the table. Countless of things. But what made me more upset than anything was how the General Manager handled the complaint. Not only that but the President of the company wasn't much better, and gave her employee the way out, instead of apologizing for her General Manager behavior.

I was scheduled to arrive near midnight, so I made a point of calling the hotel at 6 PM to confirm my room -- even though I had a guaranteed reservation which had *already* been charged to my credit card. I was assured that he room would be waiting for me upon arrival. When I got to the hotel (actually an hour ahead of schedule), I found 5 or 6 irate guests in the lobby....and I quickly found out why: my room had been given away, just as theirs had. The hotel had given our GUARANTEED and CONFIRMED reservations to other people....while still being all too happy to charge me the exorbitant rate of $900/night, in advance, for a room they were not giving me. Due to city-wide high occupancy, they were unable to find me a room anywhere else in Manhattan (or even as far away as LaGuardia). The result? I spent ove an hour in their lobby, at which time the night manager gave up and offered to give me a cot in a meeting room. And for all this, what compensation did the hotel offer me? A free breakfast. Their conduct was unprofessional and offensive, and I would never go back unde any circumstances. Stay here at your own risk!\n",

The room was very dark (minimal sunlight). The queen-size bed and small desk took up pretty much the entire room. The bathroom was tiny (my husband and I could not even brush our teeth at the same time).

Next morning I asked reception if we could move to another room and she said it was fine - our next room would be ready by the time we came back in the afternoon. Came back a few hours later, picked up our new keys for the 9th floor and went to get our bags. Turns out reception already allocated us another room (23rd floor) and moved our bags there. So went back down to reception to get the new keys. Rest of the stay was great - room was good and clean, quiet, fantastic location, good size. Got home a couple of weeks later and saw that they charged me for 2 rooms for the duration of my stay! Emailed back and forth, arguing that we only booked ONE room and they probably got confused because we changed rooms etc but they have since stopped replying to my refund requests and emails so had to start a chargeback process with my credit card provider to get my money back. I still don't know why they charged us for 2 rooms seeing as the reservation was under my name, but they claim the second room was under my partner's name who didn't book anything or sign anything!

(The staff's final recommendation: just go to a Starbucks.) We also were apparently placed in a room adjacent to a store-room of some sort, and so at various intervals during all times of night and day, the wall our bed's headboard was against would shake with the loud sounds of equipment being moved or stored. When we called about it, they said they'd look into it, and never got back to us.\n",

If you are not a nature lover or staying on property the entire time for a program this is a lousy choice...remote, limited services and downright spooky at night. The restaurant closed at 9, chairs and equipment were piled up in the former bookstore and classrooms. It's outrageously overpriced for what you get. There was no tv in the room (understandable for a \" holistic retreat experience\" but not as a luxury accomodation). Our package included breakfast for an additional $50 but not worth the 45 min. it took the first morning or the second morning which I chose to skip entree choices due to the long delay in even getting coffee. The scone I settled for was tiny and cold. The property was nearly deserted but we were put in the farthest building (next door to a building that was totally dark and looked abandoned and very creepy at night. We had to walk 10 minutes in the dark to get anything out of the car which had to be left at the top of a hill in a parking lot. Big, uncovered holes along the path could have been a disaster as could the campfire left burning and unattended on a windy night with acres of dry timber. The golf cart that transported us (crammed up next to our luggage) to our room at check in had wet seats, but was better than checkout where our luggage was tossed into the flat bed of another cart filled with tools and maintenance equipment and no room for us. Not my idea of either luxury treatment or a retreat experience. This place is riding on the beauty The Crossings created and charging rates you would pay at a true luxury resort, but it is far from luxury. I think even the staff is uncomfortable being in what feels like an isolated, if not nearly abandoned property, since my walking in the door during the day caused the clerk to jump and say I had scared him. The largest number of other people I ever saw in the place was 12 and 8 of those may have been part of the crew doing a promotional photo shoot there. I was so disappointed that such a formerly beautiful and peaceful place now seemed to be so badly exploited. Or was it just me who felt exploited? I can tell you I did when I checked out and saw a gratuity had been added onto the entire cost of the bill on top of the already excessive costs. I will never stay at this place again as long as it is under this banner.\n",

The cleaning of the rooms is brief and not through by my view. The light from the hall way/walkway outside the room shines under the gap from the the door keeping you awake, and if that was not enough the noise from the traffic would wake you anyways once you did finally get to sleep.

      "Title: “Clarion Hotel? Let's be honest...\"MOTEL\" would be flattery.”\n",
      "Text: I'm a guy who travels all over the country and stays in a variety of hotels. While I love the Four Seasons and the Fairmont, I'm fine with the Holiday Inn Express, too. So I'm traveling from the east coast to San Jose for business for a week and my wife and 2 yr. old son are traveling with me. Recognizing that we will getting into San Jose late, I decided to find a hotel near the airport so we could get a good nights sleep before heading up to San Francisco for a couple days of sightseeing. I was assured transfers from airport to hotel would be no problem, as the hotel has a shuttle. \n",
      "Upon arrival at the airport, I called for the shuttle....First Red Flag: you know the board with the phone in baggage claim where you can choose from the airport hotels and call for info? well, the Clarion was not included in the list...so i called on my cell phone and assured the shuttle would be there to pick me up in 10 min and I was instructed to go outside to the pick up area....45 minutes later while my wife and infant son sat in the cold and 5 phone calls to the hotel, the shuttle finally showed up. no apologies.\n",
      "so we drive to the hotel - it is NOT an airport hotel as far as location is involved. now i'm not that particular, but the hotel lobby is A DUMP. the other reviews about the front desk staff trying to \"stick\" you is correct. I paid $89 for rooms and anything over $39 was overpriced. If you're into the \"motel\" style accomodations where there are no interior corridors or hallways and your door opens onto a walkway or balcony, or where you have to haul all your luggage up stairs, or if you enjoy a good prostitution ring, then THIS HOTEL IS YOUR KIND OF PLACE! \n",
      "my room, along with my business partners' rooms had a peculiarly terrible smell, and the staff would do nothing about it. Throughout the night, there were vagrants walking around the grounds, and at 5 am, someone who did not appear to be a guest at the hotel, unless it was a guest \"by the hour\" was walking around on the balcony outside our room. \n",
      "While I'm sure if I stayed longer at this location I would have much more to write, I'm not chancing my health or the health and well-being of my family and we're leaving as soon as we can get out. TAKE IT FROM A GUY WHO STAYS IN ALL KINDS OF ACCOMODATIONS, DON'T STAY IN THIS PROPERTY. the Holiday Inn is across the street and looks like The Waldorf compared to this place. If you're looking for a true airport hotel - try the Courtyard Marriott which is right outside the airport grounds. and good shuttle service - i watched every other hotel shuttle pass 3 or 4 times before our shuttle ever showed up. Definitely not Clarion quality.\n",

It's what you would expect from a Motel 6 that has a suite. Formica countertops, old furniture and carpets, cinder block walls. We left after 2 of the 4 planned nights and moved up the coast to the St Regis at Dana Pointe for almost $600 a night. In comparison, the St Regis should have cost $2000 a night. The Bahia was nice about letting us leave early though. It's still hard for me understand that people are willing to fork over the amount of money for this place.\n",

Room was clean and the blokes on the front desk for the early morning shift and the night shift were pretty friendly and helpful. That is about the best that can be said. The day shift front desk bloke was unhelpful. Seemed more interested in his iPod than attending to guests. Room was incredibly noisy - so much so that I had to brave the San Francisco beggars and run up to the pharmacy at midnight to buy earplugs. The room had no remote for the TV and no alarm clock. The hot water was temperamental at best and there is no air conditioning. There is no room directory, the phones have no little sticker on them to assist you with dialing out or room-to-room, so I had to run down to a pay phone on occasions. Needs more than a lick of paint and the elevator is so slow that it's quicker to take the stairs! Dodgy locks on doors. Will take considerable work to get it up to acceptable - even complimentary ear plugs for the rooms facing Geary Street would be a start! I'm sure they can be bought in bulk...Definitely would not take a family there. Okay for young single people.\n",

      "But the real problems began the second night when the people in the room next to us were completely out of control. We had to call down three times because of them running, screaming and jumping. THEN - 5am someone started smoking. I called down around 6 to see if the front desk could please do something about it, but I ended up having to call down again a little later in the morning because of another wave of it hitting our room. \n",
      "The front desk staff were nice, but did not offer to let me use some Fabreze or something to freshen the terrible smoke smell and they wouldn't do anything about it. At one point I went downstairs to sit while my husband was sleeping, just to get away from it...and I told the front desk clerk, and she just looked at me, then she said that they are going to charge the guilty party $100....ok.....this does nothing for me.\n",
      "So I called the manager, who was rude, helpless, and really nailed the coffin down for me about this hotel. Simply being apologetic, offering a way to freshen my room and convincing me they were going to do something about it would have calmed me down instantly but instead he was just simply rude and helpless. \n",
      "Having proper management that can deal with a situation like this is imperative for any hotel I would assume...so I wish them luck. \n",
      "Bottom line: loud, small, no free coffee in lobby as advertised, management inept, good location in Chicago, front desk nice, good beds and bedding, if you like to smoke illegally in a hotel room -this place would be great for you.\n",

The facility itself is pretty and serene but the prices would overpower the relaxation. DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM THEM! The facility they use have too many hidden fees, they do not check the car out before you use it or when you return it and by opting for a full tank of gas, we were charged $72; yet were never told the grade of gas, the amount of gallons put into the car, the price per gallon. The friendly concierge desk turned into nightmares once you check out! For a little more $ there are nicer hotels to stay in. I will not be staying here ever again!\n",

We had to be up for a dance competition in 5 hours so we had to sleep with the window open, thankfully it was only in the 60's. We complained to the front desk before we left for the day and when we got back later that night it was working. The room was very outdated, except for the new flat screen tv they apparently just put into all the rooms. The pool was dirty, you could not see the bottom because it was so cloudy. The breakfast was ok, it was like all hotels give you cereal, make your own waffles, toast, eggs and sausage, juice and coffee.

Imagine advertising that they have a pool and then not being able to take your kids to it because of the MTV Beach Party that is going on........and that was on one of the few days that they actually allowed us to access the pool. Nearly all of their staff who interact with guests need charm school classes, from the front desk staff, one of whom hung up on me when we called to complain that the elevator still hadn't come after 15 minutes of waiting, to the onsite \"managers\" who tell you to fill out their customer service survey as a way to voice your concerns. Although the common spaces are very nice, catering more to their celebrity visitors then the actual hotel guests, the rooms are small and sparse (a waste paper basket would have been nice), and the air conditioning incredibly loud.......if you are lucky enough to get a room where it actually works which wasn't the case for some of my fellow travelers.

It's right in the heart of the disctrict with lots of dining options all around (although none of them blew us away, but we only tried a few). But the first thing to know is that because it's right in the midst of the action, YOU HEAR IT ALL: midnight partiers, dogs in the hotel's central courtyard, orbiting police helicopters, crying babies, trains, and the local clock's carillon...Tough if you really want to get a good night's sleep! \n",
      "Other tips--the rooms are very small European style rooms with only a separate \"wc\" with the toilet and tub/shower inside, the vanity and sink are in the entry area next to the tiny clothes rack, and the only appliance included is a hairdryer--no iron in the room (although they have them at the desk--just test it before you take it back to your room, our first one didn't work) and no alarm clock or radio. Also, if you have a car, we'd definitely recommend reserving a parking space for $10.

Don't try to enter with a huge car, though, it's tight!\n",

The good- location, interior design, staff, HVAC, and a reasonable value. I did not sample the nightlife, but the bar looked like fun. My room had two full size beds, so it never felt claustrophobic. The bad- if you've hit the age where you need glasses, it is not a good hotel choice. The lobby, corridors, bedrooms, closets, bathroom- all VERY DARK. It's a \"look\", I know, and a great one at that, but I couldn't see. Forget applying makeup. And no drawers. There's a small shelving unit, but I don't like my lingerie on display each time I open the door for room service. And the Cafeteria was very pricey for overcooked Eggs Benedict.

That was totally rude and uncivilized and I am really astonished that such a beautiful and elegant hotel has such a rude front desk representative. One more thing that bothered me during my stay was the breakfast; first I had to pay $10 bucks for a breakfast which consists of a couple of fruits and croissant.

You wait with a dozen other guests (now 15, now 21) for the elevators to your room, or to the check-in desk which is on the eighth floor.

You're grateful when \"John\" shows up in his red double-breasted jacket to excort the now highly impatient crowd to the freight elevators - past the stacked chairs and dusty cases of hotel water bottles. John's nice enough (everyone's nice enough here), and he says simply that this is what happens here when it's busy. That's what the waitress said when she tried to deliver our breakfast 35 minutes late. But don't worry, they'll comp it when it's late. They're used to it. Things here are ALWAYS late. Now you're ready to check out. You stand on the 33rd or 41st floor for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, as the crowd grows, bags in tow, waiting for an elevator to stop at your floor. Slowly the awkward banter goes silent, the humor is gone, and someone goes to call from the nearby emergency phone. They'll send someone soon. They're VERY nice - they're used to it here. The crowd grows. On a floor above, the alarm rings. Uh oh. Someone's having a worse time than you. But at last an elevator stops at the floor, ten of the more ambitious of you squeeze on (hope that alarm doesn't have to ring), and soon you're downstairs, thankful to have made it out alive. Wait on the 50 person line for a cab? No thanks, we'll just walk up to Eighth Ave and hail one ourselves. \n",

      "Text: I have spent much of the last 3 months at the Hilton Garden Inn. It is well laid out, clean and quiet, and as a business traveller it has more than I would normally expect. But without doubt the staff shine, their close knit teamwork results in the highest levels of service to their guests.\n",
      "Rooms - I have stayed in the normal rooms and the suites. Both types are spacious, clean and comfortable and have all the amenities I require. The suites are divided into two areas (sleeping & lounge) separated by the bathroom. They have two flat screen TVs, settee, armchair, coffee table, work desk, free internet (wifi & wire), table lamp, ergonomic chair (very few hotels have these and it really helps when you're working). There is also a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board. The beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet. The bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror, good water pressure, and plenty of towels. \n",
      "You can request a room exercise kit if you don't want to go to the gym, and an exercise video. A great idea (I keep promising myself that I'll get around to asking for one... one day!). The swimming pool is out the front of the hotel, it is a good size and has a jacuzzi. It overlooks the carpark, but you're not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is. It is clean, well maintained and there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas.\n",
      "The hotel is set back from the freeway but very little noise can be heard. Mostly guests are individual business travellers and many are regulars or here on longer stays so it's relatively quiet .\n",
      "Breakfast is a buffet with a really good choice and excellent value for money. 3 or 4 types of milk (including Soya) to put on your choice of a dozen different cereals, half a dozen different fruits (always a large bowl of strawberries), a good selection of yoghurts, oatmeal, pastries, bagels (6 varieties), croissants, plus a cooked breakfast buffet with bacon, eggs, hash browns, omlettes, waffles etc. Free newspapers at breakfast. \n",
      "Room Service - good choice, good quality and good value for money. \n",
      "Lounge in Reception - nicely laid out, feels homely even though you're just off the lobby. Comfortable to sit and work if you're here on weekends. Plus there is complimentary tea/coffee available all day.\n",
      "There is a small shop selling all those things that you might have forgot or, if you're on a longer stay, run out of such as hairspray, toothpaste etc. Also has wine, salads, microwave meals if you want to cook your own, cold drinks, etc.\n",
      "Hotel bus - a real plus. The hotel run a free shuttle bus service to anywhere within a 5 mile radius. They take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when you're ready to be collected. It's like having a personal chauffeur. They will drop / collect you at restaurants, shops (Memorial Mall), wherever within the radius. \n",
      "Staff - you can stay in the best hotel in the world but if the staff are haphazard or surly then your stay is marred or even ruined. I've travelled all over the world and in an average year, spend 150-180 nights in hotels. I can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams I've ever encountered. I won't name them all because I'm bound to miss someone, but when you have Nancy or La-La starting to worry about whether you've returned to the hotel at your regular time, or when the breakfast team give you a hug, then you know that the team really do care. They all take a great pride in their work, in looking after their guests, and they really do work as a team. Hilton - take note, your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team.\n",
      "Downsides - of course there are some:\n",
      "- Air conditioning units can be a bit noisy and draughty. They are next to the bed, but if they were at the other end of the room it would be better.\n",
      "- Makeup mirror - would be good to have a magnifying mirror, but it's not a big deal.\n",
      "- Room safe - plenty of space to put one, so would be good to have.\n",
      "- In-room coffee facilities are good for coffee - but not good for tea. Tea needs boiling water and it shouldn't be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste (you can tell I'm from the UK). An in-room kettle would be great. And I'm sure if I had ever bothered to ask for one, it would have been immediately forthcoming.\n",

As stated in other reports, the hotel employee was behind glass when we checked in after a late flight at 11:30 pm. I can't hold that against them, but there were problems with the room - specifically the door would not close without a lot of effort, resulting in a loud noise for my west coast daughter who was still sleeping when we woke up. Also, the outlets in the bathroom did not work at all, limiting use of hair dryers, and normal needs for charging cell phones, laptops, etc. But the worst was a local train that passed frequently during the night, using sustained loud (enough to wake us all) horn blast as it passed by the highway intersection.

The room temperature was extremely cold but we were told that the thermostat was central to the entire hotel and they could not adjust it for one room. That was the first night. It was late so we went to bed. The next morning after complaining again about the temperature they reluctantly said that they could possible bring a portable heater to the room. This should have been suggested on the first night. The 24 hour coffee was non-existent since the machine was broken. We never saw the sunny reading room that was advertised. On our last day we went to the complimentary breakfast to find one bagel left, no milk for the coffee, and no one around to help us.

When I asked for a replacement remote after working 14 hours and wanting nothing more than to lay in bed and be lazy, I was told that there were no extra ones and I could use the buttons on the TV to change the volume and channel. I asked the young lady at the desk to simply move me to another room with a remote since they refused my suggestion of taking a remote from an unbooked room. She advised me to come down and get a new key. She assigned a new room but just as I was about to move to the new room, the \"security guy\" came and, in front of me. reprimanded her for moving me to a room they may be able to sell simply because I don't have a remote. He then grabbed an old bag of beat up remotes and tried to get them to work. Once he realized they weren't working, he reluctantly gave me the one from his room....where I believe he LIVES! \n",

But our trip didn't start off that great. We had reserved that hotel because of the indoor pool; we found out it was being serviced and we would not be able to use it or the jacuzzi during our stay. The clerk didn't even apologize, and why didn't I get an email letting me know ahead of time that the hotel would be partially under construction. Then, we were mortified that when we arrived at the hotel, at midnight, there was a half empty bottle of water on the floor next to the bed (which made me think no one changed the sheets) and dried pee on the toilet seat- which made me think nothing in the room was clean. I called down to the desk to let them know the room wasn't clean and all the desk clerk kept saying way, \"I'll make sure housekeeping doesn't charge you for the water.\" After he finally understood, and after a long flight, (and it was actually 3AM for us) we followed the bellman around the hotel looking for a clean room. We had reserved a room with 1 king bed, they then put us in a room with 2 beds. My husband and I don't fit in a double bed but they said that was all they had that was clean- but when I checked in and asked if the hotel was busy, they said they barely had 30% of the hotel occupied. Anyways, after 1 hour they finally found us a room that was correct and appeared clean. They didn't have a room key so they said they would slide it under the door. The next morning, we left the room but forgot something; we tried the room key they slid under the door and it didn't work. I asked a housekeeper to let us in, but she wouldn't- that was understandable, she pointed to the phone outside the elevator so I used it to call the desk. They said they would send someone up. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we finally got into the room. There was no apology or anything, in fact they tried to blame us by saying we must have demagnetized it. The customer service was awful. We decided to check out and find another hotel. Our initial reservation was for 4 nights, and even though we checked out after 1 night, the clerk didn't even ask us why. I would assume in this economy, they could use every red cent they could get.\n",

Our room was very nice-- quite large, actually, for a NYC hotel room. It was quiet--no noise from the street--but we weren't facing Times Square. The one problem that we did have was the shower. We could get hot water in the sink and somewhat in the bathtub, but for the first three days, we couldn't get enough water to take a hot shower. The second day, they sent an engineer up, but the third day it was so cold that we skipped the shower.

They seemed to keep directing us to more touristy haunts--and we really wanted to avoid that.

      "The hotel was still in renovation mode but I believed it has come a long way over the past few months. I checked in late at night and initially I thought I was in a wrong spot. It felt like a night club at the entrance. No lobby, very dim lighting and several dark suits greeted us. Check in lobby turned out was on the 2nd floor and the process was quite smooth.\n",
      "What surprised me the most was the room. It felt like they simply painted the walls white and rolled over some dark carpeting, which looked worn already. The bedroom was \"smallish\" and felt like I was sleeping next to the window since the gap between the bed and the window-wall was less than 6 inches. The electric curtain was fun to play with but what surprised me the most was that light actually leaked out at the edges of the curtain! So, I was awaken by the morning light, with the curtains closed, before the morning call.\n",
      "Overall, if you want to party late at night and enjoy the rock-star lifestyle, the hotel is great. But if you want to get some sleep in the morning, or perhaps to grab a cab at the door of the hotel (there was no cab in the morning), avoid the morning traffic uptown, you may be better staying in Soho or midtown.\n",

Skip the newspaper and pay the housekeepers more so they'll vaccum under the beds. Please don't give me tiny bottles of shampoo and microscopic bars of soap until you can afford to apply a fresh coat of paint above the shower enclosure. And who cares about an in-room coffeemaker when it's 100+ degrees with a nonfunctioning air conditioning unit? I'll pass on the coffee and just suck down some ice cubes, thankyou. Bottom line is I want a clean, cool, comfortable room, and a courteous, caring staff. \n",

      "We chose this property because it is 15 minutes from the softball fields, it has a full kitchenette, and we got a real good pre-pay price ($53/night). \n",
      "The remodeling appears to be completed. Our room is clean and the furnishings are new, although already showing some wear. The carpet is stained near the kitchen bar. The mattress on the sofa bed is tolerable but I have yet to see one that is any better. The room also has a full bed. The room is just barely big enough. We had to pull back the sofa to open up the bed, but that is not a problem during the night. The bathroom has been renovated and is clean. All the appliances work in the kitchenette, which includes a full refrigerator, microwave, oven and stovetop. The door sticks slightly and we have to make sure it is all the way shut. The AC works but is rather anemic. We have to run the fan continuously. The room is just cool enough to be comfortable. \n",
      "Everything was clean but I did find one bug on the counter after the first night. Well, I have those at home once in a while too. Plates, utensils and cookware are included. Bring your own dish soap and toiletries, however. We used the laundry facilities today. They are more than adequate and the machines all are new.\n",
      "The property is located in a retail/hotel area that has seen better days. There are locally operated restaurants and shops nearby but not anything we were interested in. There is a supermarket nearby. When you pull into the access road, you will see a strip club but the hotel is far back along the access road. Not the best thing to look at when you pull in, tho. Today I sat outside in a common area and a homeless person was panhandling on the property. I would not say this place is dangerous; it's just not in the high-rent district to be sure.\n",
      "The grounds look very nice. The landscaping looks new and the area is well lit. The pool looks nice but it is also small. The breakfast in the clubhouse is very good but there is only a continental breakfast for the first hour, and the hot food is served at around 7 am. \n",
      "My recommendation is that if you're looking to save money on a room that includes a kitchenette so you don't have to eat out all the time, this place is just as I rated it: OK, but some (few) problems that have primarily to do with its location. A better location and I would rate this place higher. The remodeling is well done, but it's still an older property with some minor issues.\n",

The Raffaello hotel is in a great location. A little off a side street so all the main traffic isn't in front of the hotel. All you have to do is walk a block and you are in front of the John Hancock Center and a big intersection of Michigan Avenue. We arrived early around 12:00pm ish and nothing was ready as I did request a higher floor. So the front desk staff was amazing and held our bags for us as we walked around for a few hours. We came back around 3 and our room still wasn't going to be available until 4:30-5:00. However, they did say they had a handicap room available immediately on lower floor. To be honest I was exhausted and so I said we would take it. GREAT IDEA! Our room had plenty of extra space to move around in. My dad fell asleep as soon as he laid down on the bed! I took a nap too. The beds are very comfy with the nice thick but soft pillows. Something I noticed was the fan/air conditioning. It was on my side of the room and I turned it up full blast and it hardly made any noise at all! This was a huge plus for me.There were plenty of outlets for me to charge up all my electronics after the flight and before the meet. I enjoyed playing with the iHome and my iPod touch. :) The bathroom was large! I don't know if it is like that in all the rooms or just because we had a handicap room. The shower was my absolute favorite. It is a rainfall shower head but it still had plenty of pressure unlike others I have experienced. \n",

The bathroom had the usual sign about saving the world by not changing the linens every day, but there were NO towel racks upon which to hang said linens--on the one wall where there should have been a rack, there was a picture of a cactus. There was exactly one hook, next to the tub. I am a Hilton Honors member and as such, I get free bottled water just for being a member. I am also a Hyatt Gold Passport member, which got me a bottle of water in the room that was mine for only $6.00 (in Phoenix, in June). My membership was also supposed to get me a paper, which I never got. The service in the restaurant upstairs was pretty bad: we ordered at 7:00 but didn't get our dinner until 8:30, at which point I was ready to eat my napkin. But the worst was the temperature in the room. When we got there it was in the 80s, and we couldn't get the thermostat to work; we called and asked them to fix it. When we got back from our meetings later that evening, the temperature was in the low 60s and still going down, with the fan on high--it was like being in a meat locker. I called at 9 to ask them to fix it, then called at 9:30 and again at 10. Finally at 10:15 I lost it and called once again, asking for someone to come immediately. At 10:30 someone finally came to fix the thermostat. The only thing good I can say about the hotel is that it is convenient to the conference center. Period.\n",

Not a problem if you are coming or going on a cruise ship, except for the occasional times that the ships blow their horns! Finally I was there during an unseasonable cold spell with strong winds. The sliding glass door in the room was so decrepit that the wind blew right in all around the opening. Kept the room so cool I had to put the heat in the room up to 76! The property has CLEARLY seen better days. The neighborhood (if you can call it that) is not inviting and it is a bit of a hike to the trolley around parking lots, etc that are not very friendly at night. Plus side???? the restaurant/bar (Elephant and Castle Pub) has a nice selection of beers and a good happy hour special (imported draft beer for $4.25). Skip buying anything in the gift shop, fairly well appointed, but there is a CVS Drug store 3 blocks away on ASH street. BTW, why did I choose this hotel?

The furniture was significantly chipped, scarred, and mismatched, the mattress hard. I wish I had taken pictures of this room. I concur with the reviewer who mentioned allergies, I found my eyes itching and watering etc. due to something in the air. I had returned to New York to take a college comprehensive exam for my masters degree, booking the Warwick via Expedia. I was excited to stay at this historical and elegant (as pictured on the website) hotel. For what I paid ($260+ per night) it was definitely a let down. I asked for a room change at the front desk but was told I had paid for the \"deluxe\" and would need to pay more to \"upgrade\" to a non-air shaft view. I'm sure such an illustrious hotel would have higher quality accommodations; Cary Grant lived there for goodness sake! But either they have quite a disparity in room offerings (and thus prices?) and/or the management has changed and it is not what it used to be. I felt as though the hotel cared less about my satisfaction. That is not the way to impress clientel, in my humble opinion. I could deal with all this for just two nights, since I wanted to study for my exam, but most memorable and disheartening was the rudeness of the staff! According to the hotel description, a coffee pot was included in the room rate and would be there upon arrival. As it was not, I requested one. The man who delivered it practically threw it at me. On top of that, upon checkout, I was charged a per day EXTRA surcharge fee! It wasn't a lot, but I felt cheated even further. I will give the Warwick credit for being in a good (though not spectacular) location.

As a result, we both stuffed towels and pillows under our doors each night to avoid such scenarios.

When my friend attempted to use the hairdryer, there were sparks coming from the plug of it.\n",

The small round table and chairs are absolutely not conducive to effective working conditions for business personnel. There were no extra blankets available in the room which is especially critical since neither the heating nor air conditioning units were in working order. The water bottles in both rooms were not replenished after being consumed by occupants 2 and 3 days prior. There was no refrigerator or mini bar/snack bar available in rooms which is absolutely standard at every other \"resort\" I have stayed at.

Anyone could walk onto this property at any time without being stopped by personnel or card key access points. \n",

Despite our attempts to get their attention, they continued to talk with other restaurant staff, and were oblivious to our attempts to wave them over/get their attention. Once we got our food, we repeatedly waited in excess of 15-20 minutes before our wait staff checked in and gave us our bill.\n",

Because of the special needs situation, we booked (a month in advance) one of the rooms with a rollaway so each person would have a bed. This was confirmed by phone a week before the trip. On arrival the desk clerk gave us our keys indicating which room had the rollaway. Getting to the room we discovered there was was space for a rollaway, but it was not in the room. A call to the desk got the reassurance that cots were only brought to the rooms after check in - it would be there soon. We went out for supper and on return called again to inquire when the rollaway would be delivered. \"Very soon\" we were assured. Took the kids to the pool and on returning to the room it was time to put them to bed so called again to ask about the cot. The rude and dismissive night manager told me it was far too late to ask for one, they were only available on a first come first served basis but he could bring some pillows so I could sleep on the floor.\n",

It was ungodly hot in the room for 90% of the stay. The hotel staff went out of their way to be jerks! I called ahead to check in early, then when I arrived the woman did everything but scream at me for wasting her time by asking to check in early. When I came back at 3 to check in I was told that if I wanted my bags from storage that \"unless you want to pay someone, I suggest you get down there and pick them up yourself\". I paid extra to get a continental breakfast - they conveniently didn't tell me that the room it was served in was not even on my floor. They also neglected to tell me that the breakfast was in a room the size of a pea and that there was a line down the hall to get to it. Don't waste your money - it's the worst place on earth. I've never really understood why people paid for a hotel room just to kill themselves until I stayed here. It's not like you could take pills and kill yourself in your sleep in those rooms, it took the staff over 4 hours to bring us the pillows! You'd awake from death thanks to the crick in your neck.\n",

      "Text: First off, let me say that this is not a review of a Champaign tour or any of that stuff. This is a review of actually staying overnight (2 nights) at The Mansion on O. A friend of ours was in town and booked a room here. It was a suite so he asked us to stay. \n",
      "Parking here was an extra $30 per night and parking was behind one of the nearby buildings down an alleyway. Still, the car was fine even if parking was pretty pricey. Check in was pretty easy - entry was through a door at street level so you didn't have to climb the outside steps whilst schlepping your luggage. The husband of the husband/wife team who run the place took care of us and was friendly and helpful. He gave us a mini tour which was great. We were greeted in a room that looks like a library. Our room was on the 3rd. floor (I think) and it was a suite with a bedroom, livingroom, bathroom, kitchenette and an outside deck.\n",
      "Okay, here's where it gets hairy. The kitchenette was up some stairs and off of the bedroom area. It appeard to have seen better days and I'm not sure the appliances worked but there were no pots/pans. It wasn't any too clean, either so we avoided that area. Off the kitchen was a door to a deck. It looked pretty precarious - wires hanging nearby, etc. I was afraid of stepping out there for fear of falling through - seriously. The bathroom was laid out so that someone could be taking a shower and the sink area was accessable. It was fine but there was carpet throughout the bathroom (here's a ewww factor). The carpet was not real clean as none of the place was very clean - everything was very dusty. Some lint was on the carpet - it was there when we first got there and it was still there when we left - I was careful not to walk barefooted on the floors. We had the sitting room area with a pull out couch. The couch was very comfortable and done up really nicely. The pillows were comfortable and the mattress must have had a topper on it because it was not at all like any pull out couch I've slept on. I'll give them credit here. On the other hand, there was a faux fireplace in the sittingroom area. It was not quite against the wall because the entire wall was hung with art work - all for sale - even behind the fireplace!! There was no place to put your personal items such as a table, etc. because every inch was covered with \"stuff\". There was a huge walk in closet which stored some of \"stuff\" but plenty of room to hang cloths. There was a desk and after moving around the things all over the desk we used that to put our personal items on. As others have said, it's a little overdone with the kitch. There was stuff literally everywhere and everything (except the guitars) was for sale. It was like staying at an estate sale or at your eccentric great aunts old house with all kinds of crap laying around - except your aunt may have dusted from time to time. There is no central a/c so window units were around which wasn't a problem but then you got to looking at the windows and all the peeling paint outside. Maintenance is not one of the strong points of this property.\n",
      "Our room was situated behind a bookcase in the middle of a stairway. The door was a bookcase and the lock was a long spike that you put into the side of the bookcase which went into the wall to keep the door shut. From the inside there was a kind of lock at the top of the door to keep it closed. The spike, when you were gone, was just laid on the shelf behind a magazine or book to conceal it. At first, we put the spike on that shelf - but we were in the room with the inside latch set when some people who were attending a wedding attempted to get into our room. They found the spike, inserted it in the hole and we were locked in!! We had to call the front desk to have them open the room. There was no way to secure the room when you were gone. The sign on the door that said the room was occupied didn't do much good because we had several people tried to get in. When you were out for dinner, you had no choice but to leave the spike on the shelf so anyone could have access to the room. This did not give me a warm fuzzy as I had my laptop and other valuables in the room. \n",
      "I really wanted to like this place because it's the type of place that would grab one's fancy. The rooms were not cookie-cutter rooms like a regular hotel. They were unique and very interesting. The cabin room with a loft area next to ours was really nice as were many of the other rooms we saw. The kitchen was available on a kind of \"help yourself\" basis to fix your own breakfast I guess. We didn't go there because we went walking in the morning and found a place nearby for breakfast. I guess I'd have loved it had they weeded out the junk, cleaned it better by removing all or most of the \"for sale\" stuff from the rooms. Instead, it looks like they're not sure what they want this place to be - an estate sale where you can sleep or a bed and breakfast with interesting art pieces for sale. They need to go one way or another but at present, this isn't working well. \n",
      "I don't know what my friend paid for this room but from the pricing I saw online it's way over the top for what you get. I've traveled for work and stayed at some beautiful B & B's and top notch hotels that weren't near the published price of this place and were much nicer. Published rates for The Fireplace Suite - if you are not a \"member\" (whatever that means) is $900 per night - about $700 per night overpriced in my opinion - and I'm being generous here.\n",
      "I would rate this much higher if I were simply taking a tour rather than staying here because, for a tour the place is really amazing with all the antiques, artwork and collectibles. The diningroom and main floor where events are held was really nice. The intricate corridors and ways to get from place to place, hidden wine cellar and rooms were neat. All that is great - it's the staying and seeing how difficult it was that drove me to the rating I'm giving. Maybe the answer is to run this as a museum and forget about the B&B part?? There seems to be no focus to this place - is it a retreat for musicians? Is it a B&B? Is it an estate sale? I'm not sure but the Mansion on O St. is definitely unique!\n",

The two ice machines never had ice, and I tried them several times during the evening as well as early the following morning. The room was rather run down, dated and definitely in need of remodeling.

My dog laid on the carpet for the first five minutes and then my husband and I noticed, she hated being on the carpet any time after that the three days we stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend. We had to work Friday so we booked it to visit family nearby. I had to beg for soap, forks and cooking utensils despite the fully-equipped kitchen promise. I asked for more blankets because our window didn't shut and they would not give us any more blankets. (Too bad we didn't bring our camping supplies.) My husband saw cockroaches in the bathroom. Our bathroom door and the front door looked like it had been beaten in during a really bad fight. I washed down all surfaces with some soap and it made the cloth brown. The coffee pot had not even been washed fromt he past guest. I was able to get a few sheets to throw over the recliner (it was badly stained and looked like it had lots of dirt on it, but we needed it because both my husband and I had to work on Friday). The internet worked okay and the fridge kept our food from the bugs so, like I said, it was like camping. With the dog fee, we paid close to $70/night. The bright side was there was a Starbucks around the corner where we could be in a clean environment as a break. The shower did work well, but for sure we kept our flip flops on. I used a plastic liner to shield my tooth-brush, hair-brush and other items from the room. The garbage can had never been cleaned and even had dirty peelings and filth from many moons of garbage in it. I just took that can to the lobby and gave it to the receptionist. Sitting in the room it was like a bug breeder so I couldn't take it. It was like camping, except without the fresh air. Oh! But we almost did have a fire because the toaster was so old and crappy it set off the fire alarm which i couldn't turn off so I just opened the door. We travel around the world. It's bad when you're dog won't touch the floor. They know more than we did. At least we didn't get eaten by the bed bugs another couple reports. But for sure we saw the stains on the box spring another traveller reported. I feel sorry for myself I didn't \"scroll down\" and read all the reviews here before booking. That teaches me quite a lesson for future review reviewing. I hope this helps you.\n",

He said that he called the executive chef and that one of the other managers was on their way and would be there in 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes after my arrival the lady who walked out hopped out of a car and began checking in guests. She was rude to me and the 40+ guests in line waiting to check in. After 1 hour and 20 minutes after my arrival I was finally able to check into my room... Only to find that it was only partially cleaned with garbag still in the trash and a bed half made.

The balcony was so tiny that I don't think I could have actually bent my knees to sit in the 1 chair provided - it was kind of a closed-in, dark and dusty 1970's Medditerrainian style. Sadly, I never once sat on the balcony. There was a little refrig, but no microwave. The bed had the stability of a hammock. Upon check-in our porter told us we could use the shuttle at any time to take us to the Biltmore shopping plaza, at no charge. When we decided to go (around dinner time), we were now told that there was only a Shopping Shuttle that operated during the day for $10/pp. At 5pm there was no shuttle available to take us anywhere, fee or no fee.

The refrigerator didn't work and smelled of mildew. The bathtub didn't get cleaned well once while we were there. We didn't get the foam pillows we requested in advance, and our inability to get TWO extra BATH towels, every day for the duration of our stay, requested in writing via the Marriott website (and confirmed) in advance, reached the point of absurdity. By the end of the week I did a commando raid on a housekeeping cart to get the towels. We got six bottles of conditioner, and only two of shampoo, over the course of the week. The pool area, which looks lovely, still, was festooned with little dabs of duck poop from the three families of ducks that live there. Worse, it stayed in the same spots from day to day (ew). The piped-in muzak at the pool was incredibly loud, and the bass was turned WAY up so you got hours of constant reggae beat, full-blast. We'd go ask at the pool shack for them to turn it down, they would, and then twenty minutes later some other shack employee would blast it again. \n",

I had to follow up with them several times, in order to get them to keep their promises. That is really sad, when you can't even expect them to keep their word. I wont go into any more details of that stay, because it's already in here somewhere. This time, however, we are again.....not happy at all! The ONLY thing this place has to offer is the location. You will find that they are experts at finding ways to get tip money from you by hijacking your luggage, etc. You will find that the drinks they make you in the bar will be TERRIBLE, and cost $15.00 each. They don't even have a blender and cannot make frozen type drinks. Why not? Can't Hilton afford a blender? You will find that the wireless internet service will not stay connected. The signal will go in and out and have to keep trying to re-connect. We had 2 different laptops with us and they both had the same problem. We ended up going accross the street to the Star Bucks to use the internet from there. We also ended up using the Applebees (located inside the Hilton) for drinks. There is NO pool or and NO spa! The gym is very small and poorly equipped. We also expected poliote/respectful/professional staff. And, sadly, this proved to not be true as well. They were less than helpful with us on several occassions and were downright rude as well. We understood that this would be expensive. After all, it's Times Square! But, we also expected things to work! And that the food and drinks would be good (for those prices), and we are sad to report that we cannot give the Hilton a good report. AND that this is the second time in a row! Once in Phoenix and once here in Times Square-New York city. We have been traveling now for over 2 weeks. We went to England, France, Germany, etc. And all of our accomadations at the other places where we stayed, were great!. None of them were Hilton! So we have stayed in different Hotels every night for the last couple of weeks, and everyone did a better job than Hilton.

My niece and I went out for the day and came back in mid-afternoon and the same odor was in the room again. When I called down to the desk the only thing they could say is that this is the odor of the hotel. \n",

The kicker was that they called my hotel room 3 days after I checked in asking me if I wanted my welcome kit. Welcome kit is nothing special it was the materials that I picked up at visitors center.\n",

      "Text: Being out of towners on a business trip, we accidentally chose a hotel \"on the wrong side of the tracks.\" So, we went in search of another and found the W-with its very cool lobby. Well, the lobby was the only good part about this hotel. After arriving in our room, we couldn't believe how small it was. You could almost stand in the bathtub and still reach the sink to brush your teeth! It looked like a very old, run down building that had a lot of knick-knacks and trendy furniture added to it, to try to justify the high price. This was literally the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in and we have traveled considerably in the states and abroad. Besides the $8 bottle of water in the fridge, you could find an \"intimacy kit\" complete with condoms and lubricating jelly and some waxed lips in your room. Gross! Yes, the \"L\" is outside your window, and is pretty loud but it is the least of your worries. Don't leave your window shades up, as there are perverts in the office buildings next door that like the watch the guests. This hotel isn't really next to anything, except the \"L\" and the Sears Tower. Do yourself a favor and stay down by Lake Michigan. There were many nicer hotels in that area of town. There was constant, thumping loud music coming from the d.j. spinning records in the lobby and the hallways were so dark you could barely see your way around. They were also having some model shoot in the lobby as well, which was weird. Their \"King Sized Bed\" room was not a king. It was a double. They had a fleece throw on top of the bedspread that had little hairs all over it. I will never stay there again. I am glad I can say I experienced the W hotels though, so I know never to make the same mistake. Stay in a Westin. They are much nicer and not as expensive or \"trendy.\" The only reason one would stay here is to rent a room by the hour! The W Chicago says Trashy, not Classy!\n",

As usual, the rooms and beds were comfy and clean, staff supportive and friendly, and the location perfect (as well as the room rate reasonable for Boston). We have been traveling to Boston Children's for our son's complex heart condition for nearly 10 years now, but until recently we have not been fortunate enough to obtain reservations here during our stay. This hotel seemed to be very popular and availability limited. Once we experienced the Inn at Longwood, we began scheduling planned hospitalizations for our son around the hotel's room availability! We had found out first hand why it was so popular and didn't want to have to return to staying elsewhere. During our last two emergency hospital stays, the inn had no vacancies, but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room. The first time their desk clerk, Amy, (with the help of the manager, Bill Davies) managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim. Then just last week we were again faced with the \"no room at the inn\" situation and about to give up. The manager, Bill Davies, went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament. We were just about to give up late at night (after checking back frequently during the day for availability) when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us. It is so refreshing to find that there are still caring people out there who will help you when the chips are down. We will be returning to Boston and The Inn at Longwood again tomorrow for more medical treatment, and are thankful to have this refuge during times of struggle.\n",

When I finally arrived, there was no parking lot or parking garage, a lot of no-parking signs, and there were many questionable looking vagrant characters standing in the street - didn't feel too safe. Off to a bad start... The hotel was in ok shape- not great - spots on the carpet, dingy paint, etc. The walls were thin - could hear people talking upstairs and in adjacent rooms - so I slept with the tv on low to keep other sounds less distracting. There is no thermostat in the rooms - only a baseboard heat system that didn't seem to work, and a ceiling fan. Two light bulbs out in the room. No outlet plug close to the bed. Turns out, there are a lot of homeless people who live outside the hotel, and you have to pay to park a block away. This is lower priced than most hotels in the area, but it's nowhere near the quality I expected. The positive reviews I read on the internet before I booked are very suspect whether they were genuine - Don't know how anyone could call this place a great place. Put it this way: If I had had my kids or wife with me, I would forfeited the reservation deposit, and stayed elsewhere.\n",

This visit the hotel felt as if the place was old and unkept while still \"trying\" to be that cool NYC boutique hotel but missed the mark. We are a mid-thirties couple with a child who prefers smaller boutique hotels over your big brands but this time I would have preferred the Marriott\n",
      "PROS...location is excellent in the midst of midtown and steps to Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Central Park. Only other pro is size of rooms...very big and they do have a modern decor (a little too much \"less is more\" though...there is almost nothing that it appeared to be let go, not cool). \n",
      "CONS...run down over the years, somewhat dirty (they were spraying Lysol everywhere when we arrived and it reaked and rooms/elevators just felt fine nothing specially attended to), no amenities (restaurant and room service are closed for some reason and we were never made aware), customer service (no one greeted us and the reception area was dark and unlit, reception had no clue of a room change, they just seemed to do their job), manager tried bait & switch (see below)\n",

Being pregnant and with a 4 year old we were very happy...until we got there. The room they so graciously gave us was, yes, huge BUT it looked like an old efficiency apartment with a new bed thrown in it. It was unkept, reaked of lysol, dirty stained rug, had an old disgusting kitchen, outdated bathroom, and the hallways to get to it looked like rent by the hour rooms. If I had never been to the hotel before and not known what the newer floors looked like I would have demanded my money back and went elsewhere. We were switched back to our original room and the room was fine but our overall experience left a lot to be desired.

I chose the Gansevoort for its location in the Meatpacking district and reputation as a fun area to stay. The district is entirely commercial during the day, and only at night does the area come alive. Most of the people coming into the area are coming for the local clubs. But if you plan on seeing the rest of the city, the location puts you a further cab ride away. I reserved the grand deluxe room. The room was small, but clean and had a modern design. The bathrooms were nice for NY standards. The view was of the meat packing district and the river. However, the heater in the room would not turn off (call one to the front desk). Then the mini bar key was locked with no key (call two). Then the remote control did not work (call three). Not exactly what I expected for nearly $700 a night. The lobby is small and the rooftop bar is equally small, especially when tented during the winter. The NY party was packed with very little seating and completely indoors (also ran $175 per person just for drinks and a few appetizers). For my last day I decided to try the W Tuscany on Park Avenue. It had a small lobby...but the rooms were just as nice as the Gansevoort and MUCH bigger for $319 a night. Although a more business location...the hotel was much closer to most of NYC's attractions. I also visited the Hudson to see what I missed out on. The Hudson still has the Gansevoort beat on style. The Library Bar and main Bar are beautiful, as is the garden bar.

And I have put this off for several months, but with enough consistent bad service, I feel it is time to share my experience with Crowne Plaza in Austin, TX. My husband has stayed at this hotel at least once a month for the past year and on many trips, I join him. Amazingly, this hotel has had some sort of problem each and every time we have stayed there. There has not been one visit that went without problems. Not one!! We are always here on business, therefore we do not get to choose the hotel. My husband's employer, through a local hospital, gets a business deal with this particular hotel and the arrangements are always made for us. Therefore, we do not get a say in where we stay, otherwise obviously we would not continue to return to this hotel. The problems we have faced have included reservation problems such as 1) not having the employer credit card info on file (reservation is always faxed in on a hotel form) and us being required to give a personal card in order to check-in, this has then caused a large freeze on our debit or credit accounts until they can get it worked out and we can have our CC company unfreeze our accounts (24-48 hrs later) 2) our reservation being for the wrong period of time (not enough nights), the wrong type of room (if we requested two beds as we did for the one trip when we brought along our son) 3) being locked out of our room because the reservation ended a day early, with all of our belongings in our room. There have also been times we have had actual room problems such as 1) ant infestation 2) no hot water 3) no air conditioning 4) no wifi....in fact there was one visit in which we moved rooms 3 times before we got into a room that had both hot water and AC, and that ended up being the room that had ants...\n",
      "We keep thinking surely this will get better but it has not. The staff generally wants to \"make things right\" and offer a key card into the executive lounge to get food or a free drink coupon for their bar. This is a nice gesture but honestly, it would be so much better if they just got it right the first time. \n",
      "I will say the staff in the executive lounge are FANTASTIC!!! And the housekeeping staff is also really great. The concierge who sometimes is in the lobby to greet guests is really nice as well. But I am not impressed at all with the front desk and reservations staff. I simply don't understand why it's so difficult to get a hotel reservation correct....at least once in 12-15 visits!!!!! I sure wish we could stay somewhere else and we have tried to get it changed. If you are coming to Austin/North Austin, go to the Embassy Suites...it's just down I-35 a bit and my husband has stayed there and loved it!\n",

When we got to our room, I was dissapointed.....the front room area smelled heavily of unrine, and I didn't want my 2 small children touching anything in the room. The first night of our 3 night stay in this hotel was horrible, I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of water running. When I turned on the light I discovered the sink in the room was backing up and getting gross water all over our room. I went to phone the front desk and the phone in the front area was not working, so I had to move the phone from the sleeping area and they sent a plungger up which didn't work , the security guard who brought the plunger did not seem apoligetic or sympathetic to the situation he seemed more concerned that we returned the plugger when we were done trying to fix their room. Finally they moved us to a different room, so we moved all our stuff and sleeping children in the middle of the night to the new room, which at least didn't smell of urine and sink backing up. The rest of the stay was okay, but I will never stay here again or reccommend it to anyone, and I will definately will be telling my sister who is the travel agent who booked this trip not to reccommend this hotel to anyone else!\n",

After many requests we were switched the next day, but the room had so many problems. There was no furniture on the terrace, the terrace door did not close properly so we stopped using it, many lights were out of bulbs, the shower looked like it had not been updated for 20 years and the drain was crooked and broken, as was the toilet paper holder in the bathroom. Many parts of the room were not in good condition, in particular there were dangerous cracked tiles on the floor that were sticking up. By far the worst part was trying to enjoy swimming in the pool with the very extreme jackhammer noise and the dust above. Management acted like they were doing us a favor by even talking to us, but in fact they knew they have to \"stick it\" to whoever stays there, because it is obvious that there are major problems they are trying to minimize or deny.

Even with every light on in the room, it was hard to read a book. The door to the bathroom was a slider that you could not close all the way, let alone lock. But you had no privacy in any event, because the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom is actually the frosted glass wall of the shower! If you're showering with the bathroom light on, you would be pretty much exposed to anyone in the room. The shower has a glass door which, again, looks nice.

I paid over a thousand dollars for three nights, and would have been much more comfortable in a Homewood Suites. The location is excellent, and it is a beautiful renovation of this older hotel.

Upon arriving at this poor excuse for a hotel with a set time to meet the banquet coordinator,unload items for the shower and decorate, I was told the banquet coordinator was not available and could not be reached by phone. I was also informed that we could not have access to the rooms until later in the day. We drove back to my daughters which was an hr drive. When we came back that afternoon to get ready for over 100 guest we were told by the manager that the elevator would not work without HER key but she would make herself available at all times to escort our guest to the 4th floor, most of our guest had to climb 4 flights of stairs just to enter a room that was so HOT that the 3 tier cake melted and the top layer fell off. The temps outside were well over 100 degrees and the humidity was unbearable. The room was just as HOT My daughter which is 8 months pregnant nearly fainted from the heat. When I complained about the heat in the room, I was told to keep the door closed leading into the hall way because there is NO air conditioning in the hall. Kind of hard to keep the door closed when you have a 100 guest arriving. Do yourself a favor, don't waist your money on this place. This place should be condemned. It is filthy and not fit for animals to stay in.\n",

This was very irritating because cabs are not common in downtown Fort Worth. The rooms are small, old, tired and dated. The bathrooms look no better than something you would expect in a Motel 6.

But for us it was Ok, because after hitting the city all day we were exhausted every night and just crashed. The bed is very comfortable. The a/c worked fine. The weird thing was the glass window around the tub with a curtain so you could watch your roomate use the shower if you wanted. WHY? And By the way, there is no sign on the outside of the hotel telling you that it is the Hudson, so thankfully I recognized it from the pictures. Also,there is NO place to put your clothes. No dresser, no drawers in nightstand. Nothing. There is a place to hang a few things-we had about 8 hangers, so we had to leave our stuff in the suitcase which is ok for a long weekend. Staff were friendly. Concierge was able to print our boarding passes for our trip home. Hailed us a cab. Loud music in lobby nightly from the club but didn't hear it in the room. We were on the 14th floor. There's ice machine and vending machines on every floor. 15th floor has the Terrace with nice scenic views and a place to relax if you get claustrophobic in your room I guess. \n",

      "Text: My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $150 million renovation and the \"Chicago\" charm is being killed off in favor of \"New York-New York!!\" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. \n",
      "I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last 40 years. The last time prior to this visit was in 2004. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the 2004 visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the \"bellmen\" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.\n",
      "The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the \"We're completely sold out...\" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.\n",
      "The restaurant \"Lockwood\" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? \n",
      "For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.\n",

There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on 21 and then 15 is hideous! I describe at as the \"stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry\". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess!\n",
      "What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....\n",
      "Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.\n",
      "We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)\n",

The toilet was filthy, room wasn't cleaned well, mustard packet lying on the floor of the room, there was no soap in the toiled, and there was an opened shampoo bottle on the bathroom floor. We had already hauled our baggage up to the room and were too tired after our long drive, to change rooms. The next morning we discovered that the water was clogging in the tub. Very disappointed with this experience. Thankfully we were staying for one night only.

Although our 9th floor room was spacious (as far as New York hotels go) it was rather, well, kind of gross. I really believe that the overwhelming stench of bleach that greeted us when we first entered our room was supposed to make it appear as if our room had been cleaned. After we spent a little time in the room, it was quite clear our room had NOT been cleaned. \n",

Once used, they never replaced the glasses with clean ones. There were pink, sticky looking stains on the wall above our bed. One day, they didn't even make up our room despite the fact that we had the \"please clean our room\" sign on the door. For all we know, we were sleeping in a bed with dirty sheets. I can't even let myself think about it. I believe some of the upper floors have been remodelled, so I'm thinking whatever positive reviews you read about this hotel are from people who stayed on these floors. The plasma TV was nice. Again, I think it's there to distract you from the grime. And the elevators were wacky the entire time we were there. Sometimes we had to go up in order to go down. Also, the pictures they show of the lobby, well, the lobby doesn't look like that anymore. We didn't eat in their restaurant. Way too expensive and let me tell you, we hardly ever saw anyone in there. If you want a great breakfast, you've got the Brooklyn Diner over on 57th, just west of 7th, and the Europa Cafe on the corner of 57th and 7th. There are just so many other food options. And hotel options. Shop around. You've got both Sheratons, the Dream Hotel, the Essex House, the W. and a lot of other reputable hotels in the midtown area. Spend a little more, stay somewhere else.

      "My advise in going to Washington DC when it comes to asking what area is safe and whats not (and yes EVERY city has good and bad) is to do ALL your research before coming because you absolutely can NOT ask the people \"is this area safe\", at least not at this hotel, they get VERY angry and offended, and this happened to me twice in a row (the very moment I arrived in the hotel and I even mentioned how there are good and bad areas in every city). First time I asked this arts lady and straight away budged in said something like \"your be fine, how about just keep out of the NE part, how about that\" very sharp and rudely (and I think also she said something about why are you here then), so I thought to myself (I'll ask someone better if I am not going to be answered nicely) so I asked the security guard who was standing around (judging the fact he is a security guard so I thought he would be most helpful) and he says \"yeah noones going to kill you or hurt you or anything\" and I says \"are you ok\" and he goes \"yeah Im just a bit ofended you know...\" as if I had that intention to upset them, they both KNEW that every city has good and bad areas and that I was a foreigner (a tourist that is, not a immigrant) who knew nothing about it AND the act of being angry and being offended was all put on (me ending up throughout the whole vacation holding my breath) I have travelled to the USA 8 times now and every time I asked about low and high crime areas and everybody in every place told me and helped me out, unlike this hotel! I have crap like this in the UK time after time even directed at me and we all get fed up with it, I did not save up all that money to USA to experience another UK attitude. \n",
      "Other complaints is that as soon as I arrived, I went up to the swimming pool, and it was all set out which looked like there was going to be a party (ok I understand its a conference hotel), but I asked if I could go in the pool and apparently its only for people in this \"Arts\" thing, I could not use the pool the whole time I was there and when the people from the arts group came, you could not MOVE in the lobby because it was crowded so much so that we felt that we werent guests anymore, the elevator was unmovable at times and they were all drunk, (I mean VERY DRUNK) you could not even stand outside in the entrance at night without the crowd screaming about next to you, therefore unless you were toat least put up with the outside bit, you are limited to your hotel room because you were in the crowds way allthe time (you can tell the body language when you walked past). The only nice people there really was, was the people in the reception (they were VERY nice) but the rest, I would go as far to say that they need to know how to respond to tourists better, even when we were waiting in the lobby for the airport shuttle, the people both inside and outside couldnt seem to get rid of us quick enough. \n",

Upon arrival, 70 Park informed us that there was no such conversation made with them about switching the rooms (Note: Both my wife AND myself spoke with the hotel several days prior to arrival). We were also told by managment that in order to get a roll-a-way bed, we would have to had contacted them days before so they could make arrangments to get one from another hotel! We checked into our room (which we were told that it was upgraded because of the inconvience) only to find that we couldn't even walk around the room without one of us sitting on the bed because lack of space. We also found that our toilitries were opened and used, there was hair in the sink and the bathtub. As we turned back the sheets for bed, we found hair ALL OVER THE SHEETS! We contacted the front desk and found out that because it was Christmas, they had let all of their housekeeping staff leave! A manager showed up to the room with sheets in hand, but it took her almost an hour to make the bed! I even had to help her! There was not any thermostat control and it was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open in 20 degree weather. 70 Park also doesn't believe in changing the sheets daily, you must request this service. That was obvious our first night. Also, if you would like to have a drink at the bar downstairs, a glass of house wine will set you back $15. (Note: half a glass) We travel every 4 months to NYC and thought we would try a new area of town and this hotel is not worth the money comparable to other hotels in Midtown Manhattan.

      "Text: Just needed somewhere to stay for the night while we were in town. Expedia set us up with this room over the phone so we had no pictures of the place or anything . We figured a room for 100 dollars would be decent enough to just sleep in. We arrive at the motel hoping the rooms look better than the outside of the motel. Go inside and we look at each other like REALLy?? I wouldn't of even paid 50 for this room. I didn't feel safe at all here. We slept with a chair up against the door. The carpet was filthy I didn't even walk on it without shoes. The tv had porn on channel 4. It was just a very unpleasant place to stay at. I was upset with Expedia that they would even recommend anyone to this hotel , especially after reading all these reviews. Yuck !!!!!! When morning came I was so glad to get out of that hell hole.\n",

      "Text: It recently changed ownership and went from Super 8 to Ramada. It's a blight on the Ramada chain. What made me the most upset is that the picture they show makes it look like a nice hotel from the front. They have the word \"HOTEL\" really big on top. What they don't show is that the majority of the rooms are MOTEL style and not hotel. We were in the way back in a building on a slope. Second floor with no elevator and many steps. No offer to help with luggage. No offer to help with anything, really. It looked like they slapped a coat of paint on it and maybe bought new (very hard) beds. The blanket (inadequate) was stained. The windows don't have screens so I wasn't comfortable opening it to air out the room. The ice machine, as listed on their ammenities flyer, was not to be found at all in my group of buildings and you had to walk down a sloping parking lot to the main building. The fitness room had 5 machines and the bike didn't work. They advertise a shuttle service but never mentioned one and when I asked, they said to get downtown was by taxi or local bus. There's a nice espresso bar/cafe across the street but when I asked about any local restaurants they said the only thing is their own restaurant yet their website lists over a dozen restaurants. It was very misleading and since I didn't have a car, I was stuck there after returning from my business downtown. My advise is to stay away unless you want to stay at a newly painted Super 8 Motel.\n",

      "Text: Giving this place a \"Terrible\" rating is still over-rating the location. We were told that check-in could occur as early as 10:00 am with rooms being allocated on a \"first come-first serve\" basis. Reservations had been made months in advance requesting a non-smoking room. To ensure we could get this room type, we were told to arrive early. Upon arrival, we received our non-smoking room complete with malfunctioning air conditioner, moldy bathroom walls, lamp with lightbulbs needing replacement and sticky carpet. We pointed out the problems to the front desk and were told that someone would be by the room to check it out. When the staff personnel arrived at our room, he proceeded to \"fix\" the a/c by removing the filter from the unit and said \"it was slower than the new units and needed more time to cool the room\". (FYI: The cover to the a/c unit was not secured and would fall off it you got too close). Since the heat was in the 90's all weekend, we requested to be put in another room with a properly working a/c unit. We were denied and did not have any other lodging choices due to all the hotels being booked for race weekend. The bathroom tub and shower tile/grout were painted over with a white gloss paint but the faucet and shower fixtures were rusty along with the toilet paper holder. The bottoms of the bathroom walls were moldy and had some sort of mold spore pod emerging from the door frame. After a few hours, it erupted leaving spore residue on the floor. The bathmat was stained and you had to keep your shoes on not only in the bathroom but also throughout the entire hotel room. The faucet for the bathroom sink sprayed water toward the back of the sink basin. The refrigerator had a small freezer which was in such need of defrosting that you could not fix anything in it. The ice was literally a few inches thick. The website states there is an olympic size swimming pool. What we found a pool the size of what most people put in their backyard. Also, there is an \"inn-credible\" breakfast each morning....complete with breakfast items that needed refrigeration to prevent spoiling. The sausage biscuits were sitting in a pan on the counter at room temperature in addition to the waffle batter and cream cheese. I have never encountered a place with as many problems and sanitary issues as this one. The Country Heart Inn on Equipment Drive in Charlotte will only make you want to stay at home next time.\n",

We were barely acknowledged and were told that we wouldn't know \"which\" room we would have until 3:00 p.m. (we booked this 2 days prior with a staff member). When we got the room key and saw that the room was right there in the lobby area, facing the street, we asked for another room. I asked if there were other rooms for us to choose from; the flat answer was \"no, all the rooms are booked\" (but that wasn't true--as we later heard at 1:00 a.m. when a passerby was able to book a room on the spot.The room was located on the 2nd floor--very noisy, noisy, noisy---facing the street, listening to any and all conversations outside the hotel, as well as in the lobby.

I got a deal(110.00 a night) , and was a prime pick so i gave it a shot. The lobby looked great and clean. The checkin lines were very very long. A tleast a 10 minute wait. When I got to my floor (seventh) i could tell it wasnt going to be good. The walls were very very dirty, and the carpet was stained. When i got in the room it wasnt much better. You had to wear something just so you wouldnt get your socks dirty! No view from my window at all, and the windows could not even open! The room was very dusty and looks like it wasnt taken care of. No bags in the garbage, the tub looked like it been there for years without cleaning with all the stains. The only thing that did this room justice was that it had web t.v. ($5 for half an hour and $3 every hour after that), it also had on demand movies to pay for like pay-per-view ($12 a movie) and you can check out of your room using your t.v. so you dont have to stand again in that long line. At Hotels site they have pictures there of the rooms in Pennsylvania. ITS A LIE! ITS NOTING LIKE THAT AT ALL!! RUN!

      "Text: My husband and I just returned from six nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We asked for a quiet location and didn't care about a view, and were given room 701, a junior suite that faces the side of the McDonald's building next door. It was well protected from neighboring room noise (it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet) and fairly protected from street noise, but more about that in a minute. The room was very large and clean, the bed and chairs comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people (though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries). The bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan, as it has no vent or window, and a couple of days when I attempted to shower around noon I had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water (this didn't happen when showering earlier). The kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters, as we did not like the in-room Puck's filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee. The Azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar, including items such as stuffed tofu, sesame noodles, and seafood, a hot foods bar, and many essentials such as boxed cereal, baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks, so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner. A table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk, and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both, but we only had the desk.\n",
      "I had read some reviewers' comments about rooms being too hot, and they were right. In fact, the entire hotel is overheated, and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40-degree air at all times, including at night. Fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units, which created a nice white noise for sleeping. Unfortunately, though, the smell of McDonald's often wafted in. A fan-only setting on the heating/AC unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy, but the only option at this time of year was hot air, because the hotel hadn't yet switched over to AC. We're lucky that we didn't arrive later in spring, because I can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there! Also, there were no screens on the windows, so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open.\n",
      "I do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators: Stay on a lower floor and take the stairs! We were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time, though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing, especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats.\n",
      "The second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed, and has two computers with Internet access for guests. The trouble is, there's no regulation of usage, so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other like-minded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends. Her mother finally told her to get off--but then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email! The other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to Flickr, apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs. The staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area.\n",

Even the cockroaches were checking out!! It's such a shame, because this hotel is rich with history, but in desperate need of TLC. I was moved 3 times because I just could not stay in the allocated room, the first was on the 8th floor and it really was the most disgusting thing I have seen. I went back to reception and the manager who must have heard it all before so was most unhelpful did give me another room which I thought was something from a horror movie. The paint was chipping off the walls, the bathroom had urine stains on the toilet seat, the curtains were non-existant, and then I did the ultimate. I checked under the sheets and mattress, and yes, you guessed it BED BUGS....By now, it was 12am and I was exhausted, so I slept fully clothes, even with my shoes on on top of the bed, using my coat to buffer the contact with the duvet, and moved out the next morning. This room was on the 2nd floor, which resembled a youth hostel with all the college kids hanging around, although even they were complaining! The next morning, I went back to reception and they moved me to the Penn Club Executive room on 13th floor, which was marginally better, in terms of the room being painted and the furniture not looking like it was found in the garbage. The maid even gave my room an extra clean, and the benefits of this room was the complimentary breakfast, which was a bonus, but served in the smallest room ever, so it was a cramped and rushed experience in the morning. \n",

Yes, location is a +, but I suggest stay in Soho at a small boutique hotel and really get a comfortable enjoyable stay. THis hotel is a stain on NYC and it should be ashamed to be standing amongst the great city, and I wonder how much repeat business they get so my advice is do not stay, find somewhere else and hopefully the more bad reviews and reduced business they get, will encourage the management to sort this place out. \n",

While the view is stunning the rooms lack natural sunlight and seem gloomy, even on a sunny day. The hotel needs to improve on cleanliness - rooms as well as public areas such as the lobby. Furthermore, being in an area that at night seems to be suffering from a high crime rate visible security would be appreciated to provide a sense of comfort and safety.\n",

      "Text: This was my frist time visiting NYC, which can be overwhelming enough, but when you go to check into your hotel, after finding it through the never ending strees of NYC and you experienced what I did, you may never want to go back. When I first went to check in, they had double-booked my reservation, noting that I had booked 2 rooms instead of 1, which was not the case. I had all my paperwork and confirmation numbers and emails that I had been receiving about my upcoming stay,etc. So instead of even caring that two reservations were made, the guy behind the desk just wanted my money so he said here sign this and then you'll have to call this reservation company and figure out how to cancel it. Unbenounced to me, I booked it through a reservations company that they use to book their hotel rooms, therefore that company gets a commission, so automatically he could just blame it all on them. I was not going to sign anything until the 1 reservation was cancelled, so for the sake of me actually staying at the hotel the man said he \"took care of it\" and would just deal with it later and I got a cancellation number etc. At this point I was completely stressed out, we were supposed to go to a show and were running out of time. So then we finally go up to the room and were going to just drop our stuff and go, but all of a sudden there was a knock on the door and a man asked us if our tap water was working. So we turned on the sink faucet and saw that the water was BROWN, dirty and disgusting and brown. So at this point we turned on the sink and tub and let it run, while getting on the phone to book another hotel. Once were luckily confirmed at another hotel, we went back down and checked out. Which was a whole other nightmare. The man said he would give us another room, but I did not want another room in a dirty hotel with HORRIBLE customer service, he never apologized or anything. At this point we were late for our show, so we had to pay a cancellation fee as that was our ONLY option to get out there. I then had to spend my weekend stressing about the numerous credit card charges on my card and am still fighting to get the cancellation fee removed. It was by far the worst experience EVER. Do not ever stay here, save yourself a lot of time, money and stress. Ridiculous that thye are even in business.\n",

It is adjacent to Fairfield Inn and Courtyard By Marriott. All three hotels share an underground garage that sits beneath the hotels. Self parking in the garage is $20/day and valet parking is $25/day. There is a well appointed TGIFriday's located in the Fairfield Inn and you can dine there or have it delivered to your room through room service.\n",
      "The hotel is very well appointed and serves a continental breakfast every morning. Rooms are well appointed and are trendy. Each room has a large Phillips LCD HDTV with plenty of HD channels available. Free internet is available via Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi signal strength is very good and download speeds were 1.5 Mbit consistently. The room has an independently controlled HVAC system with a digital thermostat, microwave, and small cube fridge. The bathroom design is somewhat interesting in that is a split bathroom. The main sink/vanity and tub are in one room and the toilet and small sink are located in another area. The beds were very nice with high quality sheets and coverings. The night stand contained a phone along with an iHome clock radio with iPod Dock.\n",
      "As for other features, a fitness room was available with a variety of equipment available. The hotel features a very small indoor pool that probably could safely fit about 20 people in it. A business center is available where you can check your e-mail and print off boarding passes. The lobby is well appointed with free coffee and wi-fi. The breakfast area was very clean and offered a variety of hot and cold items for breakfast. Typically scrambled eggs and sausage patties were available along with a do-it-yourself waffle machine. A variety of cereals, bagels, and juices were available as well. \n",

In our opinion there was a big problem during our stay (which was not on the third floor) and the management simply does not care or want to hear about it which most likely speaks to this problem continuing on and other unfortunate travelers being affected negatively. We asked to get the name and number of the owner of the hotel. The manager stated he did not have time to deal with our concerns and hung up on us. Our stay will cost us several thousand in expenses, lots of time and the bites are very uncomfortable. If someone hears of a class action lawsuit please post. It seems very unfair that guests suffer a costly injury from staying at a hotel and then are left to pay for the aftermath of what appears to be poorly managed operation.

My experience has given me a quite range of knowledge about the industry... Now with my credibility built up, here is what I think of the Hotel Stamford.\n",
      "Location: Excellent! Steps away from great locations in Manhattan such as Koreantown, Empire State, Penn Station, Manhattan Mall and many others, this is for the people that do not care about rooms and do care, mostly, about location.\n",
      "Lobby: Cold (feeling, not temperature-wise), with a very small check-in desk, old and dated counters, furniture and an elevator that looks that it should be in an antique museum. Light is very bright-white business like and I feel like I am walking into an office building more than a hotel. I guess you can claim that it adds \"feeling\" to the hotel... yeah, right...\n",
      "Amenities: The hotel offers free wireless in the lounge floor only between the early morning hours until 3 pm. After hours, the guest must pay... what? That is the biggest oxymoron I've heard in a long time. Why charge for only a few hours of the night? There is a couple of computers in the \"business center\" but, after I heard stories of identities being stolen from public computers I do not like to use any of them. (This is not a lie or urban legend story... one of my friends used a computer in the business center at a very reputable hotel in LAX and, 24 hours later, the credit card she used to pay for the charges was hacked and thousands of dollars of online purchases were charged to her credit card). \n",
      "Rooms: All I have to say is... \"YUK\". Here is why: The decor/color is 60's green with super white bright lights, old phones and televisions. Furniture was chipping away, and the room just felt as cold as the lobby. \n",
      "The bed spread/cover is very old. I immediately take it off the bed as they are the ones to harbor bacteria and the nasty stuff you can only find with a blue light. The bed was very old and could feel the metal springs on my back and was concerned if one of them will come through the fabric and 'poke' me in the back. In addition, the curtains were made of the same material as the bed spread. The television channel selection sucked with only a handful of local channels and a few international. \n",
      "The only positive thing I have to say about the room is that it has a refrigerator. In other higher quality hotels, a refrigerator is a 'luxury' item with some even adding an additional $30 or more dollars to the bill when asking for one. \n",
      "The ultimate cleaning test I do is to wear clean white socks and see how they end up at the end of the evening while walking around. Lets say that in a mater of minutes, my white socks were black. I wonder when it was the last time this hotel's carpets where shampooed and properly cleaned.\n",
      "Bathroom: The basics are given such as shampoo, lotion and soap. Water pressure was good and towels ok but, again, old and a better cleaning detergent could have been used. Hairdryer did its job but was very loud. Everything else worked fine.\n",
      "Wake-up call: worked fine but not even a voice at the other end. Most hotels will have either a recording or live person give you the time and weather conditions but not here... just silence.\n",

It's located just one block behind the heart of Times Square on 8th & 48th. The hotel was spotless, the rooms were huge and very nice - for NY standards. And...I have stayed in many other hotels in NYC and this is the first hotel that had 'sound proof' rooms. I couldn't hear the street noise or even the fire department next door. To top it all off...I'd mentioned in passing that i was in town for my bday to their front desk receptionist (Abigail) who then sent a free breakfast voucher to my room. So sweet! Then...my flight was cancelled out of LaGuardia and I was already checked out and at the airport when I found out. I called the hotel & they told me to come on back - and even offered me another free breakfast because of my problem! Staff is top notch and the hotel is gorgeous. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!!\n",

The room was average and relatively clean (the bath grout could use better cleaning). The beds were comfortable enough and the pillows good. There are only two floors to the hotel, so the first floor windows face the parking lot - not so great, and the second floor windows face a fire station across the street - not so great when they get calls in the middle of the night. The hotel is next to the freeway, making it easy to get where you're going, and super close the the airport.\n",
      "The toilet in our bathroom kept running after flushing. Since it had taken so long earlier in the day to ask a question at the front counter (no one was around), I decided it would be quicker to try and fix it myself than call and wait. I stuck my arm into the tank and re-hooked the plastic chain that had come off because it was too short. Luckily, I know how to do this, but some people might not. Anyway, who wants to stick their arm in a hotel toilet tank anyway? Definitely not the highlight of our stay. (Should have gotten a discount for fixing their toilet !)\n",
      "They offer a full breakfast, but be sure you are there first thing in the morning. Once they run out of something, if there is less than an hour remaining for breakfast (which ends at 10 am), they will not make more. Both mornings we arrived for breakfast at 9:30 am. One morning they were out of bacon but would not make more - \"we're closing soon\", and the second morning they were out of biscuits - same excuse \"we can't make more, we're closing soon\". In fact, they don't wait until 10am to close, they start packing it all up at 9:40. I told my son to run up to the counter and grab what he might want because they were putting everything away 20 minutes earlier than we expected. We ate our breakfast while the hotel staff wiped tables and threw away trash around us. Not very appetiting.\n",
      "The second morning they were also out of milk, so he couldn't have cereal. No biscuits, no cereal. He had a banana and toast. (The first morning we asked if there were more bananas.

The staff member at the check in was not very helpful, did not explain room or amenities, tried to get away with giving us one key.

I wanted to go change it but my husband was extremely tired after driving for 11 hours did not want to bother. The place where you eat dinner and breakfast is not connected to the rooms so you always had a long walk and had to go out in the chilly weather to get there. The food was okay but not up to the standard of other Homewoods we have stayed at. There are several hotels in this vicinity and this hotel was the closest to 270 and our room faced it so it was very noisy plus all during the night there were train whistles going off frequently.

Do your own hiring of cars. Also not one person from reception asked if we enjoyed our stay at end of 7 days - Also airconditioning outside motor in next door offices very noisy during week days - ok weekends as is turned off.

We were able to confirm only a two twin bed room, but were advised to request two doubles at check-in. We arrived early around 9am, expecting to check our luggage. Despite being sold out on doubles, they checked for two rooms, both with doubles, and said we could check in soon. After about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby; when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready. We went to the room, which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan down the street. Two double beds, a huge bathroom with two sinks, a separate toilet room, an oversized bathtub with a hand-held shower head, and a separate shower room with a rain-type wall mounted shower about 8' up and a separate hand-held. The door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed. I couldn't believe that we had been given a two-room suite, so I called the front desk to check. I was put on hold but got no response so I called back after a few minutes. They first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room, but when I explained that I was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that I had reserved only one room. I locked the connecting doors myself.\n",
      "The room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting. Flat screen TV, i-pod dock, one robe (but two pairs of slippers) in the closet, two toothbrushes and toothpaste, iron, ironing board, shoeshine machine, hairdryer, safe, etc. Minibar, jars of nuts (3 kinds), bottles of imported sparking water, basket of apples. I assume that only the apples were complimentary though. (the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turn-down service -- I guess they really wanted us to buy them.) Extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each, a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman, glass desk with chair, and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate. Complimentary internet access -- wired and wireless, although the latter worked for my son, it didn't for me, There was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked \"internet cable\" in one of the drawers.\n",
      "We checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel. I asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure, no problem. We didn't need to keep our keys because there was open access. We returned around 4:30 pm and went to the pool. Locker room had full-sized lockers stocked with robes and slippers; towels were piles on a rack. Keys were in the unused lockers. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, shaving cream, razors, etc. all available. Two shower rooms, one equipped for handicapped. Large steam room. Three or four lane lap pool, with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters. Small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day. We went to the airport and arrived home late, tired and relaxed. Our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip.\n",

      "The staff was so friendly, since we caught an earlier flight we figured we'd be out of luck checking in many hours early. To our surprise, they quickly accommodated us and even offered us to eat at their breakfast counter gratis. When we got into the room it was clean, spacious and well appointed for a room costing less then $100 per day. \n",
      "A pool and spa were offered for use as part of the price, although we didn't use them. Breakfast was included as was free parking. Overall, this hotel was the best bang for the buck and left us with no hesitation in saying we'd absolutely stay there again when in Charlotte.\n",

      "Text: The Adolphus Hotel refers to itself as \"Dallas Luxury\" and I find that misleading to out of town guests. Dallas has much more to offer. The lobby is beautiful, old world and happening - we saw a number of activities take place during our short stay: A formal auction, a Red Hat Society tea party and the remains of the Christmas Parade. But once you leave the lobby, it is obvious that less attention is given to the suites. The wallpaper in the hallways were peeling, the furniture was squashy and the carpet was clearly quite old and out of style. Our overnight stay was very disappointing. Everything in the room was old, in a bad way - the chairs were stained, the lamp shades were beaten in, the carpet was mashed and peeling up along the edges, and the bed was surprisingly terrible to sleep in - the pillows smashed down to nothing and the king sized mattress was lumpy, rickety and not supportive at all. The bathroom was very disappointing: olive colored toilets and bathtubs with non polished brass fixtures and soap holders. The hospitality area was a cubby etched out of the wall with the oldest locking refrigerator I'd ever seen, old candy and breakfast bars and a bi-fold door with chipped paint. I feel confident that the rooms have not been redone since the late eighties looking at the window coverings and carpet. \n",
      "We planned to order breakfast-in-bed but quite frankly didn't want to spend anymore time in the bed or the suite for that matter, so we checked out of our romantic weekend early. The staff were very helpful and kind, but it was also clear that they were a bit understaffed as the registration table on a Sunday morning was backed up and the car lot was a mess. I've had worse stays in a Super8 along the highway, but I've never had as bad as stay for what we paid. As much as I like to support Dallas's history, I say spend your money elsewhere and enjoy your evening.\n",

My boyfriend and I stayed at this place, also known as the Grant Hotel on W94th St twice, for 2 nights each time. What a disappointment. The check in staff were courteous, but we straight away noted the fact that this establishment is extremely TIGHT!!! \n",
      "1. Shared bathrooms- usually OK in most places, but there was only 1 bathroom to about 8 or 9 rooms, and in the case of the first/ground floor- only 1 shared bathroom total. The bathrooms seemed to be cleaned only once per day- not enough for a shared facility- they were pretty filthy by the afternoon. No bath mat. There were no hooks or anywhere to place things except on the toilet!!- and in some bathrooms, not even a toilet holder or towel rack. \n",
      "2. The room- we had a double on one stay, and a double double on the other. Both times the rooms were very dingy- a single fluorescent bulb in the centre of the room and no table lamps. The beds themselves were fairly comfortable, except the bottom sheet was not fitted and you quickly found yourself sleeping directly on the mattress. There was only a thin bedcover and 2 requests for blankets went unmet- apparently they were unable to access blankets after hours. This meant that the two of us slept in the same bed for warmth- thus not using the 2 beds we had paid for. The heating also did not work, and we were informed there was nothing we could do. \n",
      "TV- limited channel selection, but whatever, cos there were only a limited number of working remotes in the whole hotel, and the first time we stayed, we did not get one.\n",
      "The first room- the double double- was very spacious, but pretty much had nothing in it except the beds and remote control-less TV. There was a gig empty closet off to one side which was probably intended to be the bathroom but thehy got too tight to put even a sink in, which most places with shared bathrooms have. \n",
      "Both rooms were very noisy. The walls were paper thin and given that people are coming and going at all hours of the night, you could hear doors slamming all the time. \n",
      "3. In general- No tourist information located anywhere in the hotel. No pay phones. The phones in the room were exorbitantly expensive to use, and there was very poor cell phone cpverage. The desk staff, whilst on the whole quite friendly, were absolutely unable to do anything about our complaints. We asked to be moved due to the noise but the hotel was full. The desk staff were unable to offer us a refund or discount. We attempted to complain to Woogo but the freecall number could only refer us to the website- where we could find NOWHERE to write a complaint- or to a UK (international!) number, which we couldn't call, there being no payphone in the hotel!! (It was raining for all of these days, and very cold, so we didn't want to stand on the street at a payphone).\n",
      "On our second stay, the toilet flushing mechanism broke (on the only toilet on the whole floor) and despite telling the desk staff this at about 2pm, nothing was done till our second complaint later that night. \n",
      "Dingy. Cold. Dirty bathrooms. Poor sleeping conditions. So why did we return for a second stay? Because our return was going to be within a week of our first stay, we found it hard to find anything affordable at such short notice, so we were stuck.\n",
      "We would not stay here again. We would not recommend this place to anyone. For the money, if you book with a few weeks notice, you can find much nicer places to stay in Manhattan (try Chelsea Lodge or Hotel 17. Not going to bother with photos, cos the flash only makes the room look OK.\n",

Rooms on that side come with complimentary earplugs (no joke) and \"sound machines\" to distract you.\n",
      "After the first night I moved to a room on the other side of the hotel, where the noise is not a problem, but the long early trains do produce a vibration that you can feel throughout the whole place (the first morning I figured it was either a train or an earthquake!).\n",

When I finally exited the car to approach him, he was chatting with another hotel staff member about a sport event. When I went to interrupt I was told to hold on a minute. I took the bags out of my car and waited for an ADDITIONAL ten minutes while the chatting continued until he turned and said, just leave it, I'll park it in a while. When I asked if I needed a claim check, he said \"No, just your room number.\" I was uncomfortable with this (and rightly so, I would learn later) especially since when I exited the hotel 30 minutes later my car was still there with the door wide open.\n",
      "That evening I scheduled a wake up call with the front desk for 7:30a, as I had a shoot down the street at 8am. I was dismayed when the call came 25 minutes late. When I asked why it was late, the response I was given was \"Oh, is it, oops...\" I subsequently rushed to get out of the door on time, called the valet to pull the car around and went to check out. When I got to the front desk I returned the keys and gave my information and went to head outside when I realized... I had been checked out of the wrong room and charged incorrectly. When I returned to the desk, the annoyed clerk (like his error was my fault... I gave him my name AND room number) serviced everyone else, then came back to me, taking an additional 20 minutes to correct his errors. Without apology. When I went to valet I noticed my car was not there, even though at this point it was almost a half hour since I called. He informed me that no one told him to bring the car around (although I had called the desk and requested it). Then after 10 minutes of running around he realizes that the valet yesterday never marked my keys and they didn't know which car was mine... Another 15 minute debacle...

My daughter slept on the sleep sofa, which is probably fine for children, but was very uncomfortable for her, resulting in complaints of back pain throughout the trip. \n",

Little things, but felt like I was in a slum. \n",

We waited about 45 minutes for just some oatmeal one morning, and finally gave up and left to buy breakfast elsewhere. There was plenty of bread for toast, cold cereal, muffins, but hard to get healthier options like bagels, fresh fruit, or hot cereal. Coffee ran out 3/3 mornings also. On the mornings that we had a little extra time, we waited but were still not able to get our simple preferences. On the morning that we had to be out by a designated time, we settled for dry cereal and toast. \n",
      "The hotel was very busy and the staff was generally courteous, although if we mentioned any of our concerns, the response was \" We have a large group here today.\" Evidently it was so busy that we often waited 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator up and a couple of times chose to walk down rather than wait. Additionally, the air conditioner/heat unit was incredibly loud, so we had to turn it on for a while, shut it off to sleep, wake up hot, turn it on to cool, then off to sleep. At check out, we were charged for an extra night of parking and after waiting for breakfast, found it irritating to have to wait to resolve the overcharge. We did stop a the manager's reception one night where they served unlimited drinks, potato chips and bags of chex mix. It was nice, although a couple of free drinks and chips certainly does not make up for the inconveniences. The only saving grace for us for this facility was that the location is very good.\n",

First, there are dozens of blackout dates, which at least they're honest about and show you up front. BUT THEN, there are severe restrictions on how many of the coupons they will accept each week, so you have to book minimum four weeks in advance. This they don't tell you until AFTER you purchase the coupon. I spoke with the Sales Director who told me there are plenty of rooms available on various dates for regular customers, but not for the (lowlife) Living Social people.

Additionally, we felt that we wasted too much time waiting in line and then being ill advised by the concierge. (BTW, we were forced to seek out the concierge because the Business Center was invariably closed. For a site as large and business-centric as the Westin, the limited hours of the Business Center are unacceptable. It wasn't open at all on Sunday and closed early on Saturday. I would have much preferred to MapQuest my few routes on my own, instead of waiting in another long line for the concierge.) What irked me most about the concierge service was their combined inability to get me the correct details on taking a public bus to Dodger Stadium. (Pick up the #2 or #4 bus from Broadway to the stadium and walk up the hill.) While I realize that most employees and tourists drive to each point of interest, I was traveling from Boston and NYC and sought easy public transportation and walking routes to some sites. At the very least for travelers such as myself, the hotel should make available simple directions to local sites via walking or bus/metro. We ended up walking home the 1.5 miles from Dodger Stadium. While it wasn't the prettiest walk, it was easy and safe.\n",

The beds were comfortable and room service was great. There is also almost no good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. They do offer a free shuttle within 2 miles but it is unreliable.

      "Text: This hotel is priced slightly lower than most other Manhattan hotels for a reason. The rooms themselves are nice enough, but the shared bath is a pain in the butt. There is only 1 bathroom per hall, so you end up wandering the halls looking for an open toilet/shower. There is no complimentary breakfast, and they even charged extra to hold our bags for a couple hours after checkout! The Comfort Inn in the theater district was a better price, free checked bags and complimentary breakfast, with just as nice of a room and your own bathroom. I am sure there are also several other better hotels than the Alexander in Manhattan which are in the same price range.\n",

The day we arrived the air conditioning was barely working and it got worse each day we were there. The managment kept telling us it was being repaired, but each night when we returned from pre-wedding, wedding and post-wedding festivities, it just got hotter and hotter. We had elderly people with us, as well as a family member who is in a wheelchair. We took pictures of the temperature in the rooms and at times it was 92 degrees. It was a holiday weekend and there was no place for all of us to go. Management offered us free parking and $10 off the room? Were they kidding? We are all disputing the charges with our credit card companies. If you must stay here, please be sure the air conditioning is working before you check in! And don't bother to deal with the front desk staff - saying they are ignorant would be a compliment. And by the way, stay away from the restaurant!\n",

When we arrived at your hotel, the two security guards / doorman told us that the elevators were broken and that we had to carry all four of our luggage up the stairs to our room. We asked for a bell service but they told us that there was none and that we had to “deal with it ourselves”. Please look back at your camera footage. This is the worst service I have ever seen by far for a hotel of your nature. We booked your hotel for New Year’s weekend and hoped to enjoy ourselves but instead found that the service your hotel provides is horrible and in fact, racist. Coming from an Asian descent, we felt that the doorman/security was extremely racist towards us due to our race and did not want to help us at all. I was with my wife and two kids and with a total of 4 luggage. Even a passerby (another hotel guest) was willing to offer their help to us. Even a homeless person would offer their help seeing the conditions we were faced with. In addition to the horrible service we received upon arriving, the hotel room smelled disgusting (similar to new plastic/remodel.

      "How very, very nice it was to stay in a hotel with some character, rather than the bland formula of an hotel like a Hya-lto-rriott. I found the general feel of the Omni very comforting - like they've been taking care of important people for years and I was in good hands. I might not be considered that important by many other people - but they appeared to find me so, and I enjoyed going along with it.\n",
      "A huge positive point for me was the fact that I slept like a baby. Like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room, in fact. This hotel is made out of good, solid materials, not the usual plasterboard and echo-ey corridors of an ant hotel. I wasn't once kept awake by frisky neighbours, or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms. Good sleep = good mood and good work.\n",

      "Other than that ... friendly, helpful staff and great location for the business district. Although it's a little way from the tourist hotspots, it's no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport ... or, (heaven forbid) use your legs!\n",
      "The one and only issue I stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant - so maybe it's not that fair to post here ... but since the restuarant is affiliated, and there's a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it, I will!\n",
      "The issue? The gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate, reclining in its self-satisfied way against my mightily over-priced and, presumably, very embarrassed steak.\n",
      "That long, lone carrot was, quite honestly, the most revolting vegetable I've ever eaten - and that includes the times I've accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery (food of the devil) in a salad. I can't believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere.\n",
      "If you're a beef aficionado - or even just someone who likes good food - just don't bother. Yes, the steak tasted good ... but not an eye-rolling, conversation-stopping, stress-sapping, umami-ridden explosion of great that I'd expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef.\n",

      "Text: Having used Radisson hotels in the past, we thought we couldn't go too far wrong. We arrived in the early hours, very tired, and looking for a room, and were advised by the night staff that they had just had a cancellation. Despite the fact it was 01.30 in the morning, the reservation assistant was adamant that he could not include breakfast or reduce the rate. We were also advised that we would have to pay a $22 valet parking charge! After some negotiation and dismay with this and the room rates, we were given a very small discount. How I wish we had found another hotel. We approached our room to find dirty glasses and coffee cups lying in the corridor outside, and it went downhill from there. Inside the room, we found a half consumed meal and bottle of water in the fridge, biscuit crumbs on the chair and table, and a 'sticky' pest control device underneath one of the beds. Far from there being a 'cancelation', it was clear that the room had recently been used and not been serviced. Only one coffee cup and water cup remained, there was no laundry bag, no glasses or cups in the bathroom, and the beds had not been made up properly. These were the almost forgiveable aspects of the airport Radisson. The completely unforgiveable, centred around the grey and stained net curtains, the stained bed linen, the cracked sink, the wallpaper peeling off the wall, and the socket hanging out the wall. The room was shabby and tired, with old fashioned furnishings, cathode ray TV, and was certainly not what I would expect for nearly $300. Added to this is the audacity to charge $22 or parking, and the valet parking service provided by individuals who openly tout for tips. Unfortunately, having travelled far with a half asleep eight year old, we were far too tired to take issue with the room that evening. We raised our disappointment the following morning with the reservation manager, Gandy, who was clearly dismayed at the situation, and offered an immediate reduction. We appreciate your efforts, Gandy, but this Radisson hotel needs to address the fundamentals of hotel value and service provision. I have no doubt that our room had been 'double let', having probably been used for a 'day let' or airline crew, and to then charge nearly $300 for an unserviced room is unacceptable. However, what is also unacceptable is the standard of rooms being provided at premium rates. This hotel has obviously seen better days, and needs a substantial refurbishment, but there appears little incentive so long as there is a lucrative airport traveller catchment market. Don't be fooled by the grand entrance and valet/concierge desks - if you have the choice, do yourself a favour and find somewhere else to stay.\n",

I'm not a germ-o-phobe by any stretch of the imagination, but I wouldn't walk barefoot on the carpet. The hallways (especially in the non-tower parts of the building) stink horribly. The final straw for me was after dragging my luggage through several doors and down carpeted hallways, I actually had to carry it down some stairs because there wasn't an elevator handy. In the process of trying to do this, my calf rubbed against the stair edge which had a sharp metal piece hanging off of it. Of course, since I was wearing a dress, it cut my leg and still, more than a week later, I have a scab from it. There are much better places to stay in Houston -- I'd advise looking elsewhere (and for Pete's Sake, don't book a convention here).\n",

It had a filthy carpet, stained walls, broken night lamp, broken old-fashioned tv, flea market furniture, no a/c or fan, small and few towels, dangerous uncovered steam radiator, dim lighting, lumpy bed, very weak shower pressure and the walls were painted different colors. How they do business is beyond me. There are better hotels for the same money. It is so awful I intend to contact the NY dept of consumer affairs. Save time, money, and stress.

On arrival we were told that there were no studio suites available, so they would give us a one room suite on the understanding that we'd move out the next day into the studio suite we had booked. Later that evening we had a phonecall telling us that we could stay in the one room suite. We were very happy as it had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The suite was very comfortable, two decent sized rooms and a kitchenette also three phones, two televisions and two bathrooms. The bathroom in the bedroom was very small, as has been mentioned before, but it was more than adequate and very clean. There was a desk, chair, coffee table and sofa in the living area.\n",

There is a shop next door which sells drinks, snacks and sandwiches and there are a lot of restaurants in the area. 34th Street is excellent for shopping, and you are within walking distance of 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The only negative was the noise from the building site across the road (on 31st street.) We were on the 16th floor, but could still hear when the builders started (at 7am!). The building site was next to a church (which rang it's bells daily at 7am), and opposite that was the famous fire station which was on the go a lot of the time. I think that the noise would be most noticeable on the north and east sides of the hotel (we faced east), and you might be better on the south or west sides of the hotel if it bothers you. They are still refurbishing, and you enter the hotel via the 31st Street entrance, but this is not a problem as there are plenty of porters to move your bags for you. The refurbishing was not a problem at all. No noise or hassle.\n",

I literally threw a fit and was granted a free voucher for my next stay. That brings me to my most recent stay. I was once again put into a not-very-nice room with rusty fixtures, a dirty bathroom, and scratched furniture. Since it was free, I was okay with it. But thank goodness I was only staying one night.

The staff is young and clueless (you should know that the loop of the business park you are in is just a tad more than 0.5 miles, and you shouldn’t be giving out handouts claiming it’s 1.29). Your staff should know how long travel time to attractions (Bank of America Stadium, etc) should be distance and time wise. It’s just sad that they didn’t. There is no exercise room/facility on site, but they do offer day passes to a local gym, but they can’t tell you how close it is. The pool area is only accessible from outside?!?! It’s a nice pool, but nothing special. The breakfast area is small, but I left too early to comment on the amenities. The room is fine and is pretty standard. The sink area indeed is a touch small, but not a problem. The Wifi is a little slow, but not achingly so. The problem with this property is two fold; A.) its new(ish) so the expectation level is higher, B.) the Fairfield brand has undergone major upgrades over the past few years so here again the expectation level is raised. This location looks good, but doesn’t deliver. Too many other choices in the Charlotte area for me to consider coming back.\n",

      "Text: We recently stayed for two nights at the Warwick Regis, and had mixed experiences throughout. Perhaps we should have recognized that there would be some ups-and-downs immediately when, during check-in, one very hospitable clerk took us through the sign-in process while another Asian woman clerk screamed into a phone at the desk within five feet of us throughout the entire ten minutes of this uncomfortable and unwelcoming encounter! Our rental vehicle was valet-parked, a pricey ($29 +) convenience that allows unlimited access throughout the day, rather than \"in and leave it\" for the week end. It was always ready after we called down about 20-30 minutes before we needed it. Thank you, Nestor! The next- and major- disappointment was the size of our travel-site package room: surely the smallest they have! Be sure to check this beforehand, as it was barely big enough to walk around the canopied bed and avoid hitting the huge armoire. An upgrade would have added $40 per night to the bill. The room is clean, if not crisp- with its period brocade furniture and chandelier. The bathroom desperately needed a ventilation fan, as it harbored dampness and molding grout. Opening windows to get fresh air (since air conditioning is so un-SF) only lets in the rumbles and sirens of the traffic on Geary Street, a major thoroughfare. Also be careful about the snack basket placed bedside: the pricelist was missing and the temptation was great. The breakfast buffet looked appealing, but the very stately dining room on the right never seemed to have a diner throughout our two evenings stay. Coffee is free for the guests who venture in and ask for a cup -to-go.\n",

Our room's air conditioner had been leaking and didn't realize until the second day that half of the carpet was soaked and the room was musty smelling. We didn't report this right away, due to the fact that my husband didn't want to change rooms, and thought surely the housekeeping would report it. The rest of the carpet was vaccuumed, however, filthy, you couldnt walk on it at all without shoes or the bottoms of your feet would be black. Definitely does not live up to the Ramada name and price. Much nicer motels in same location, won't visit a Ramada again.

The room we had was a \"suite\"- which contained two double sized beds & was the size of any other average hotel room- not a suite by any definition. We got to the room & tried to get booked into another hotel- this place was awful & I was concerned for both safety & hygiene. We had to prop the window open with a water bottle as it would not stay up on its own- the lamp shade had MASSIVE burns on it- which came from either a cigar or a crack pipe- I'm guessing the guests of this establishment are more inclined to have crack pipes on them not cigars. The lamps & TV did not seem to turn on or off on their own- the trick was to plug them in- and unplug them in when you wanted them on. We did not shower in the room- socks were worn at all times- we slept fully dressed. This place looked NOTHING like the rooms on their website. The only positive was that we were only here for one night. That said I'm willing to pay 3 times more & be in a less convenient location to avoid staying at the Pennsylvania.

The front desk was very apologetic, kind and helpful and didn’t hesitate to give us another room right away. We took the key to try out the other room, which was in a lower floor but slightly larger. The smell wasn’t that bad, it’s at least something you might get used to if you stayed for long enough.\n",

All toiletries I expected were available, including nail-filers which not many hotels I’ve been to provide.\n",
      "Bed:\n",
      "The bed didn’t look too welcoming. The sheets were yellowish, and didn’t have that feel of crisp new white sheets that I so look forward to in hotels. However, I did sleep throughout the night, so nothing about the bed bothered me during my sleep.\n",
      "Breakfast:\n",
      "The breakfast was included in our stay, which I think was well worth it. It was a menu breakfast instead of a buffet, but you could order anything you wanted for $50/person. Anything beyond that would be charged. However we ate there comfortably for 3 mornings and it never exceeded $50. The breakfast staff of the restaurant were friendly and the service was fast. I loved the food too, everything was fresh and good quality.\n",
      "Concierge:\n",
      "The concierge didn’t really know to suggest things to do to our liking. I asked what was there to do in L.A. besides shopping (it was still too early for nightlife), he pointed out a few museums but that was it. When we asked where the best spot would be to take a good picture of the Hollywood sign he showed a corner on the map, we marked it on our navigation and drove there, but then decided to get closer to the sign and found out there are a dozen better places for a picture!\n",
      "Lost & Found:\n",
      "On the last day while I was packing my bags I realized that I was missing a jacket, I thought I must’ve left it in the first room that was too stinky to stay in. So I called the Lost & Found and asked if there was a jacket left in that room, they said yes and brought it right away. Then I though what if I completely forgot that jacket, would’ve they called me to inform that I might have forgotten an item in a room that I checked into before? We stayed there for four nights, I forgot the jacket on the first night, and they neglected informing me about it. I’ve forgotten a jacket in a dorm room after a semester’s end in collage and they called me afterwards so that I could claim it. This is a four star hotel!\n",
      "The hotel was trying too hard to be cool with the style and furnishing but at the bottom of it it’s just stinky and not very well maintained which only makes it look cheap. A wide flat screen TV is not the solution to a modern hotel.\n",
      "We’ve stayed in another Sofitel Hotel before, and that wasn’t that great either, so I guess this will put an end to our stays in Sofitel.\n",

They said management had been told about the error by many guests but it was not yet corrected. I then was told they just switched to only valet parking in there garage and there was no parking allowed on the street. I went up to the room, which was not very nice. To turn on the A/C I had to go down on my knees since they had installed a window A/C unit at floor level that had it's control panel on the lower corner. Stupid! Rugs were dirty; toilet seat was broken; shower head was broken; no stopper in the sink which was located in the room; more furniture than the room could accomidate, but no closet. You had a mid sized wardrobe in which even my shirts were to long. Just strange and I had to pay a double rate because they were sold out the first of two nights. Guest computer access at $.50 cents a minute for a boarding pass. No comp breakfast or anything else included in the rate. I tried to check out this hotel on Trip Advisor before booking, but could not find it listed, to my regreat. I had no apoligy upon checkout and was glad to leave. Mel Heifetz\n",

      "Text: My mother and I stayed at the Park Central hotel in NYC for 6 days in September. We were quite impressed when we walked into the hotel lobby, but were quickly unimpressed by the front desk guy who acted as though we were bothering him by checking in. out of about 4 front desk workers i spoke to over the duration of our stay, 1 was pleasant. The room did not have a coffee maker or anything extra to make the stay more welcoming. just shampoo and soap, not even a shower cap. but that isn't a big deal, but when you pay $400/night, you think you'd be getting the best of the best..but i guess it is New York after all and it is waaay more expensive. What was a big deal, was our first day of housekeeping, someone went into my suitcase and stole my favorite skirt! i didn't notice until the next morning when i went in to get dressed for the day and realized it was gone. We searched every inch of the room for it. We contacted security who was really friendly and said that this does happen. I had my suitcase closed, but not zipped...so be sure to zip and lock it! i've traveled all over the world and stayed at all levels of hotels and never experienced this. we kept the room locked and security ensured that no one would enter our room without a supervisor. we asked that we not have our room serviced again. well the next day not one, but two people tried to enter our room while we were in there! I told front desk who didn't seem to care. In the end all we got was $100 off our $400/night room for a \"guest complaint\". they wouldn't even comp the one movie we rented on the tv. terrible! barely covers the cost of the item that was stolen. i'm just glad more wasn't taken from me or my mom.\n",
      "On a positive note...Conceirge was AWESOME!!! which we later found out were not employees of the hotel, but a hired company placed in the hotel. they were FANTASTIC!! best service ever! heck i'd go to the hotel just for info! definitely not to stay.\n",
      "Room service was crazy expensive. so we never ate at the hotel so i can't judge the food, but it must be good for that price!\n",

We went to NY for a show and although the location is perfect -walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping, Central Park, the hotel is old underneath all that flashy decor. You can see it in the paneling and the floors and the doors. The rooms are TINY TINY TINY. We were upgraded to third level of room - \"Superior\" .. superior WHAT?

I do have allergies and other reviews mentioned the stale, moldy smell. We decided to continue with the reservation, as my husband did not want to stay at a different hotel than his coworkers. \n",
      "We checked in this afternoon and were given a room on the 5th floor. It was horrible. My eyes started to burn and I got a headache within minutes. They had an \"ionizer/air cleaner\" running on the top of the TV stand, so that should have been a clue. We left the room immediately and tried to determine what we should do. We had just parked our car with valet, and had dragged all our luggage in with a hot and cranky 5 year old. We went down to the front desk and spoke with the assistant manager. She said she totally understood my situation, as she suffers from allergies. She said it was \"worse\" on the 5th floor and gave me a key to a room on the second floor. I looked at it, and there was a difference in the smell, but still musty. We decided to just \"stick it out\" for these two days, figuring it was not worth all the hassle to change. My husband's company was paying and they had secured the rate etc... had this been coming out of our own pocket, we would have moved rooms immediately.\n",
      "Ok... now the positives. The staff here has been very friendly. We love the location and always enjoy staying in historic hotels. This place is interesting and memorable, and has a lot of character. It is right next to the Alamo and a quick walk to the river. We had a great time in their pool, very large compared to the Doubletree Airport location we just came from.\n",

Decor is cheap 70s in the rooms, and the bathrooms need a serious updating. This could be a really great place if someone took the time to update the rooms.

      "Text: We were looking for a beachside town and Ocean Beach fit the bill. We stayed at the Ocean Beach Hotel, which looks like it's been around for a long, long time, judging by some old pictures we saw (including pictures of the hotel before a street separated it from the beach). The front desk staff and cleaning staff were very professional, accommodating and friendly. \n",
      "We stayed on the second floor with a partial ocean view; rates for each of our days varied between $140-160. Our view also included colorful local characters (as one reviewer has noted), who hang out near the POW/MIA memorial across the street. The \"local color\" also attracted the S.D. police three times, who twice hauled away people. The third time appeared to be some kind of \"contact\" visit by cops to talk to the homeless, the skaters, other rough characters and the well-dressed people attracted to them (drug sales?). \n",
      "That said, we walked around day and night and never felt threatened -- no aggressive panhandling (and little panhandling in any case), no need to watch wallets etc., like we might have felt elsewhere. The vibe was good.\n",
      "Ocean Beach has done a good job of deflecting chain stores (although the fought-over Starbucks up the street from OB Hotel easily had the biggest crowds of the coffee shops we frequented). In fact, our find was that one should hit a local coffee shop. Besides the lines being shorter, folks are remarkably friendly and open, the coffee is excellent and the pastries are local and better. Hit the same place three days in a row and you'll be shooting the breeze like you've lived there a year. So while the anti-corporate mentality may be a bit militant, it makes for a pleasant main street to wander up and down. \n",
      "Now to the hotel. The room smelled musty and the carpet had that mildly-wet feeling from high-humidity climates. Our bathroom sink faucet swiveled left-and-right, though not by design. The toilet was constantly on the verge of stopping up (did the previous tenants through a baggie of dope down it?). There was a table on the patio, but the patio had some kind of half-worn off macadam covering that made it uneven (repairmen were working their way down patios sanding that stuff down, which was very noisy during the day). The room had two chairs on opposite sides; we used the bed for sitting and as a table.\n",
      "There was a fridge and microwave.\n",
      "The wall had been torn and repaired (badly). There was a new door to the bathroom, and while that was fine, the frame around it was unpainted. \n",
      "An attempt has been made to spruce up the courtyard -- box planters on the 2nd and 3rd floor railings, container plants below, strings of lighting overhead, and so on. Some of the lights were burnt out, and the fountain in the middle was bone dry. Indicative of good intentions that are not well-funded.\n",
      "A good cable TV selection and free wireless internet were bonuses.\n",
      "As others have noted, the rooms are very noisy. From newlyweds on one side (they'll learn, I guess) to a guitarist practicing his heavy metal riffs (presumably for a local show one evening), to drunken screeching in the courtyard, to the sound of Harleys being revved, to one fight on Newport Ave outside our room, to revelers at all hours (including nine a.m. one morning), to a pretty good ad hoc music jam session (think three of the talented players were sailors) at the POW/MIA memorial, to fire trucks, to a thumping bass from a nearby bar, to the occupants above us daring walk to the bathroom, to people yelling at their buddies across the street -- the joint is NOISY. We've lived in 24/7 congested areas of several large cities abroad and in the US and never had noise like this. So, if you want a quiet weekend by the beach, this ain't the place, by a long shot.\n",
      "We enjoyed the town and its free-wheeling environment, but hated the hotel -- save the staff.\n",
      "We figure for the annoying noise level and the run-down condition of the hotel, it's worth about half the price we paid per night. And a major chunk of that is what Ocean Beach Hotel is all about: location, location, location.\n",

Apparently you have a choice between emailed folio or delivery to your room. I now wonder if there was a similar choice for newspapers that I was never offered.\n",

It appeared clean, but was slightly on the small side. There were no offensive odors, but it seemed within fifteen minutes any time I entered the room I began to feel stuffed up and suffered from sneezes. I found it odd the closet lacked a luggage rack, and housekeeping never replaced the laundry bag taken from the closet.\n",

I'm all for helping the environment, but leaving a room only stocked with two towels is laughable. They didn't even have a bath mat. Just two bath towels, two hand towels and one wash cloth. I was not pleased. I requested more towels and it took 23 minutes to deliver what would be considered a full towel set. The shower had rust marks on the tub floor and was in need of a full tub replacement. There was a mystery hole in the ceiling above the bathtub.\n",
      "Bedding wise they offered decent pillows, blankets and sheets, but no fitted mattress cover. So every morning you wake up with a sheet curled under your feet, or feet touching a bare, dirty, disgusting mattress. How can a brand name, so-called full service, hotel not offer a fitted sheet for a mattress? That's something you'd expect from a bad motel.\n",
      "The Sheraton's hallways and common areas were very dirty during my stay. There were many empty beer bottles just left on the floor in the morning. I came back one night to find a housekeeper's vacuum just laying the floor in the hallway. I think this location needs serious help when it comes to the housekeeping department. Additionally, they need to stop with the cheap green initiatives. It's one thing to save a couple bucks on the lights or skimp on towels, but now they've permanently lost my business because of those aggravations. If I wanted to be green, I'd go camping, I wouldn't stay at a hotel.

      "Text: The Omni Shoreham is a welcome respite in a fast moving city, and I would definitely recommend it in the summer months, if you want a combination of a resort and a city hotel. It was really nice to come back to this beautiful hotel and relax at the pool - which was incredible - complete with drink and food service, and a 24 hour fitness center. We booked two rooms (one a suite), and the hotel accommodated us nicely, placing the rooms next to each other. We did enjoy our stay - even though we had the misfortune of being there two nights when fire alarms went off (the week prior to 4th of July). Being an Omni Select member, I expressed my dissatisfaction and insisted that I would only be happy if fully compensated for the nights that were interrupted by the alarms. I know others reviewed this hotel and were very unhappy with the fire alarm situation, but to tell you the truth, the hotel did deal with it well - in my situation - maybe becauseI was more assertive in expressing what I expected of them! Thus, I am still rating the Omni 5 stars, and I hope the they have corrected the faulty alarm system, so that no one has to experience being evacuated without just cause. In summary, I would give this advice to my fellow travelers: If you are at all dissatisfied with a stay, be professional and polite and express yourself. If you don't get the answer you are looking for, make sure you are dealing with the manager. If you still don't get the answer you are looking for, write to a manager in the corporate office. That usually works, especially if you are a frequent guest of that particular hotel chain.\n",

The hotel itself certainly was much nicer than the average hotel that I’ve stayed at over the years. However, I’d have to say that there were a few issues.\n",
      " My flight into Houston was cancelled, and I was rerouted through several other air carriers. These airlines were unable to successfully deliver my luggage in a timely manner. Alas, I checked into the hotel on March 10, 2008 without my luggage.\n",

On the morning of March 11, 2008, I left all of these items in my hotel room along with my toiletries, medications, platinum arrival gift, and several other belongings. I also left a note asking for the A/C to be looked at, as it was not working (luckily, the room was not uncomfortably warm yet).\n",
      " My luggage managed to be delivered to the hotel later that afternoon. I picked it up when I stopped by the hotel during a quick break in my work schedule. I was very happy that it arrived, and I brought it up to my room. Curiously, the room was in a state of disarray. Every cabinet and drawer in the entire suite had been left open, and the sofa cushions were propped up in a very odd manner. This was odd, but I just figured that some special cleaning had been done or something. Lots of odd things tend to happen in hotels.\n",
      " My elation at the luggage arrival must have kept me from immediate recognizing that almost all the things that I had left in the room that morning were now missing. I did notice that my note about the AC had disappeared, and the air blowing out of the vent felt slightly cool. I figured that they must have fixed it. I turned down the thermostat a few more degrees and went back to work.\n",

I quickly realized everything else was missing as well, except for my cell phone charger, and a magazine I had left in the restroom. I called the front desk and asked for an explanation, and I was told that it must have been a “mistake”. I was absolutely furious. I ended up leaving a message for the hotel General Manager, Barry Shank, explaining my situation. The room was very warm – clearly the air conditioning was still not working properly.\n",

To be safe, I packed up all of my belongings before I left the room. I stopped by the hotel again that afternoon to find that all my notes had been removed (except for the one on the thermostat), and nothing noticeable had been done to fix the A/C. The room was uncomfortably hot. I searched the Internet for alternate accommodations, but due to the nearby rodeo in Houston, the area was sold out.\n",
      " None of my belongings were returned, but there was a message from Mr. Shank on my phone letting me know that I was welcome to go back to the grocery store and re-purchase everything that the hotel had removed and I would be reimbursed. Apparently, I was guilty of not leaving enough luggage in the room, which at this particular hotel is understood to be a signal to the hotel staff to steal everything in the room. Clearly, I’m paraphrasing a bit, but the implication was definitely made that I was at least partially to blame for not leaving any luggage in the room and I was lucky to have received such a generous offer. Nonetheless, I decided it would be a waste of my time to purchase more items which the hotel staff may or may not steal again.\n",

I must have been successful, as when I returned to my room late that evening, I had a voicemail from someone explaining that the maintenance staff had determined that there was a problem with the air conditioning in my room. Mind you, it wasn’t actually fixed yet, but they were going to fix it someday. In the meantime, the hotel was going to need me to change rooms the next day.\n",

Mattress was covered in body fluids probably blood and God knows what. Curtains were filthy and we got a room with a pull out couch for my two daughters. It wasn't even a pull out couch. It sagged in the middle and was filthy. Bathroom was gross. We had to spend the night because it was so late and we had been traveling for hours. They also told us on the phone that they would valet our car. Not true.

      "Text: I stayed at the Hilton for an end of summer getaway with our children (11, 8 &6) from for two nights. We had stayed with friends last year and went back to enjoy a relaxing stay by the bay. We splurged on our room to get a bayview lanai for $400 a night so that we could enjoy the beautiful view. I called the hotel to clarify the room and asked which room was a patio so that we could enjoy the grassy area outside the room. The reservations at the hotel told me that this room had a patio so we paid our $400 per night plus parking and set it up. We arrived early hoping to enjoy the pool while we waited for our room. The pool was closed for some contamination problem so we sat by the bay. Finally when check-in was official, we went to get our room. The $400 room was on the second floor not the first. When I explained about the first floor the management said too bad we are full. They offered to cancel my reservation at no penalty but that was it. So we headed off to our second floor room to check things out. On the balcony, our $400 view of the bay was obscured by a huge tree. The room had been renovated inside since last year and they did a nice job with the color schemes but the trendy furniture on the balcony was horribly uncomfortable. That night we went to the nice restaurant. We were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I asked for outside and the hostess quickly announced that there weren't any tables availabe. When I asked how long the wait was she rolled her eyes and strode off to check. She seemed aggravated by my request. That sentiment was standard among the staff at the hilton. They were all dismissive and curt...not what I expect for $400 a night. After all of that fuss, my kids got food poisoning at the restaurant that night so for the entire next day our balcony was lost to the dirty laundry. On our final day, room service for a pot of coffee took one hour and they double charged our room. I have never paid so much money for so little. Other than the location on the bay, the Hilton was a bust. At the price of their rooms I would have been better served staying at the Hotel Del or the Pacific Terrace...they are expensive but worth the splurge.\n",

The staff is well trained and friendly (unlike a competitor one block east). The spa while under promoted and hidden down a hallway was fantastic.Two thumbs way up to Dora for the wonderful massages! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and of course the heavenly bedding is wonderful. The only negative is that both the pool area and health club are in need of a face lift if not a makeover. The gym has far too much equipment jambed into a small room off the pool. If you use the treadmills (which we both do) you'll feel like a sardine with the stranger next to you being only inches away. I'm a retired pool builder so a little hypersensitive about pool areas but this is a residential size pool serving a large hotel so managing families with guests who like a quieter pool scene is difficult. Perhaps management can come up with a creative solution because if you like to lay around the pool, have a beer and read a magazine then you'll find the half a dozen screaming kids (the parents of which do nothing to control) just a little irritating. The pool area itself is overdue for a serious cleaning. The concrete decking was filthy, some sling chairs need replacement and there were only enough terry cloth covers for about 6 of the chaise lounge chairs. The bartender and bar were nice but Westin needs to give this area some attention because while the hotel is 4 stars the pool area comes in around a 2.5. Unless you spend 100 percent of your stay around the pool you won't be disappointed at the Westin.\n",

However, as I came to find, the Surrey was every bit as luxurious as some of the other boutique hotels but without the crowds and traffic.\n",
      "I will say that I probably won't be booking the Surrey when using Jetsetter again because it was a total logistical nightmare. Normally, with my busy schedule it is very hard to follow up on a hotel booking but it seemed that the Surrey was having some major issues with the Jetsetter site because it took at least 7 emails back and forth with the very helpful GM, Spencer to lock down the day I needed as Jetsetter kept saying it was unavailable and would not show the reservation. I was told there were some issues with the hotel's reservation computer system which might have accounted for the glitch.\n",
      "However, once I actually got to the Surrey, all the hassle I went through making the reservation was worth it. I was upgraded to a fantastic room with a small sitting area and plenty of space. The hotel staff couldn't have been any nicer or friendlier. One of the ways I always judge a hotel is by how the staff treats the guests. From the desk clerks to the doormen to the GM himself, you will be treated as a valued guest here and the staff will go out of the way for you if you make a request.\n",
      "The thing that stood out the most to me was the bed. It was amazing ... without a doubt the best bed I've had at any hotel in NYC. It had extremely nice bedding, including one of the nicest down comforters I've seen ... I forgot to ask where I could buy one when I was checking out of the hotel. I was only there for one night during a worldwind schedule, so its too bad I did not get to use it more. There are plenty of pillows as well, which are not too firm or soft.\n",
      "The room is very tastefully decorated. Normally, I do not love grey, white and black color schemes because I feel they are not very warm and semi-depressing however, the Surrey did it right. The room felt classy and comfortable without feeling too blah. The bathroom was also one of the biggest I've had in NYC with a nice shower that had a great double head and awesome water pressure. The marble and mosaic made it feel very classy. The toiletries were nice and plentiful.\n",
      "One thing I did not use that I thought was cool was instead of the nip-sized bottles in the typical mini-bar ... the Surrey offers bottle service in the room. For $45 - $55 you can buy a 350 ml bottle of liquor (enough for 3-4 drinks) and a bartender will come to your room with the mixers, etc. and mix your first round and leave you the accoutramonts for the other drinks you will make. There are about 15 different drinks you can choose to go with depending on the bottle you choose.\n",
      "The location is great. Those who want to be closer to Broadway/Times Square would not want to walk there and back as it took 30 minutes at a fairly brisk pace to make it to Broadway. It is a short cab-ride to that area and they are pretty good about calling you a cab because this hotel is fairly removed from the action, so cabs aren't plentiful. The location is in a residential part of Central Park. 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue are only a 10 minute walk and because it is so close to Central Park, the walk is not bad. I prefer staying here as opposed to staying more in the 'action' because it is very quiet and laid back ... not at all hustle and bustle. It almost feels like being in a residential neighborhood, which is probably why the price is a bit higher than some comparable hotels.\n",
      "I found the rates to be reasonable ... mid-April seemed to be in the $400 - $500 range for a standard room. You could stay at the W for much less, but I wouldn't say the two are comparable in terms of the luxury bedding/service, however the vibe is similar. One thing I didn't like as much is that if you are traveling with a business partner, they do not have many rooms available at the entry level price range with two beds. I was told upon checking in, the only room they had available with two beds was a junior suite, which would cost $795 per night. The regular rate for an entry level room was $495 at the time.\n",
      "I did not use the restaurant or bar at the hotel. The lobby isn't as spacious as it looks on the website, however it isn't as busy as a lot of other hotels, so that isn't really a problem. I did notice that the staff at this hotel do not beg for tips as they do at a lot of the other full service hotels in the area. At many hotels I stay at for business, it seems like one person takes your bags out of the car, one person wheels them into the hotel, one person parks the car and another person takes the bags to the room. I didn't really find that at the Surrey. I was at the Barclay during this trip as well and was literally chased down into the street by a bellman who moved my bags from my room a few hours earlier who wanted to let me know that it was him that moved my bags earlier that morning.\n",
      "If you have some money to spend and enjoy being outside of the action in a more laid back area, the Surrey is for you. I will say that after several years of staying at their nearby rival hotel, I am making the Surrey my new home for business travel in NYC. I would describe my stay here as luxurious and relaxing and thank the staff and GM for making my business/personal trip so enjoyable.\n",

Unfriendly reception staff who were apparently not very experienced at their job and who did not make you feel welcome at all. Not even an apology for being kept waiting. Room quite newly decorated, but in very ugly colours from the 70´s era so not pleasant to look at and lacking a luxurious feel. Bar and restaurant are extortionate! Go outside to eat and drink. Worst of all were the mind blowing charges to connect to wifi for each appliance. This was a real kick in the teeth after paying so much for the room in the first place and this issue left a bad taste in my mouth for sure.- Would never use this hotel again and urge you to research elsewhere for more a generous hotel that does not aim to rip you off and somewhere that gives better service than this place.\n",

      "Text: I planned to stay for 3 nights, but moved to a different hotel after 1 night due to terrible experience. At check-in, I asked to upgrade to a larger room. I was told one would be available in a 1/2 hour. We went to lunch and returned an hour later and were given our room keys. We entered the room and saw it had not been cleaned. We walked around the room and found personal belongings (cell phone) and realized the guest had not checked out. We reported this to the front desk and were sent to a different room. I questioned the bed size - looked like a double and we wanted at least a queen - and was told the bed was a queen, but come back to the front desk and we'll give you a \"better room\". We went to the 3rd room and found it was identical to the 2nd. The room was so small that my husband and I could not walk around. We had to hop over the bed to get to the bathroom. We tried to take a nap but couldn't sleep because the pipes in the bathroom were rattling each time a different guest used their water. There was a problem with drainage in the shower; I stood in water up to my ankles while showering. While waiting in the lobby for a friend, I witnessed a fight amongst the front desk staff. A woman said to a man \"don't you dare raise your hand at me like that again. You are not my boss\" and she stormed out of the lobby onto the street. Other arguments between them were witnesssed during the stay. Lastly, we asked the front desk when breakfast coffee would be available because we were starting our day really early at approximately 5am. We were told breakfast is not available that early, but the front desk staff member offered to make coffee and provide breakast pastries to accomodate us. The next morning, the front desk was left vacant and the breakfast area was dark. We entered the room in hopes that something would be available. We only had 5 minutes to spare. We found the front desk staff person sleeping in the breakfast area. We asked for coffee and he said he could provide juice instead. After all of these issues, I found another hotel in the area to accomodate us. We then checked out after one night. This hotel was terrible and I will never stay there again.\n",

The rates charged position the Hotel as a top class hotel and the only thing that justifies these rates is the staff who are mostly doing their best to be helpful and attend to your needs. Everything else was not at par with what you would expect in Manhatten at this level. The room ( we took the Deluxe!) was very small and poorly furinished, the bathroom tiny and very basic and the worst was the terrible noise form the street . The windows are old and do not isolate noise nor cold which means that you get noise both from the street and from the heating system that blows all night with a lot of noise.\n",

It really is in the red light district... homeless people in the streets on both sides of the hotel. Most nights there was screaming and yelling in the streets. The doors are locked with cages each night. We spoke to a French couple who were booked to stay a few nights, they said they were re-booking to another hotel straight away, as they were \"very afraid\". When we arrived we were greeted by a porter who had holes in the knees of his trousers and who looked like Manwell from Faulty Towers. The stay definately had its humerous side, we were travelling with my sister and her husband.

When the chain that lifts and drops the sunscreen that scrolls over the window broke, they fixed that pretty quickly (and the woman who came to fix it was nice). When we asked for some non-down pillows and comforter (which caused allergies), they did remove the pillows and comforter when we were out, but they didn't replace them until we called again and asked them for, uhm, some pillows and blankets.
