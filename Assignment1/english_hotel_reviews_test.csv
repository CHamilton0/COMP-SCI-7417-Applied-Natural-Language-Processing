i was so surprised i will return,my husband and i just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary we normally stay at very high class hotels but that night we wanted to try something new without spending a fortune st regis ritz etc are our norms we wanted the tribeca area so we pulled up to the hotel unassuming front the bell guys were so nice and took care of our bags right away while checking in we had at least 3 people come up to us and say happy anniversary being starwood platinum we had it all set up to hopefully get an upgrade we gave 12000 points which was the minimum they told us we could not have a suite and we were a little disappointed but it would be fine because he was giving us a great view then the manager came in and changed everything and gave us the nicest suite ever they gave us the top floor they brought champagne and chocolate strawberries quickly to our room it was the best ever the room was simple but beautiful the view was amazing the bed was soooo comfortable and i slept like a baby i cant say enough about the bathroom it was sooo nice i would give the bathroom a 5 star im not kidding for a sheraton it was very impressive i dont know why i havent been to this hotel before now that i know how nice everyone is there and how extremely comfortable they made us i will go back soon we go into the city a lot and i will for sure go back thank you so much sheraton you wowed us,5.0
a motherdaughter vacation,i could not leave a bad comment on any part of our stay everyone was so nice our room was kept in great shape for us too this place was so clean,5.0
good choice for precruise,i spent one night at this hotel prior to a cruise friendly staff is very noticeable wherever you go in hotel building is historic site in old bank building lobby is particularly beautiful breakfast was excellent as was comfort of very large kingbed room no pool and no balconies but everything else is excellent yes there is a large number of homeless people walking around the neighborhood but they didnt bother me large shopping center and excellent restaurants in gaslight quarter outside your door its about 10 blocks downhill or a 800 cabride to the port,4.0
great value for a king queen and princesses,great value for a king queen and princesses we stayed at the pacific terrace with our two daughters 35 and 8 months old for five nights in early march the hotel was beautiful clean and comfortable it looked even better in person than on the hotel website everyone was friendly we really enjoyed our patio and even the view was great from our partialoceanview the room was roomy i wish the beds werent so high off the ground since i have two young children but the rooms were beautiful there was a big flat screen tv the sink and mirror were separate from the tub and toilet which made it easier for us to all get ready there was always a fresh basket of linens outside the door the next morning in case we needed an extra towel the included breakfast was very good with fresh fruit cereal pastries juice coffee water and yogurt the afternoon wine reception was very relaxing we sipped our wine by the pool the pool area was beautiful and comfortable our 35 year old daughter loved the fresh baked cookies in the afternoon and adored the turn down service because she got chocolate on her bed at night i enjoyed the free internet access in the lobby we walked to dinner many nights the hotel did a fantastic job of referring us to different dining spots we really liked being able to push a stroller all along the beach on the sidewalk above the area is difficult to pinpoint exactly it is a 50s beach bungalow type location there are alot of college kids that live in the area as with any busylarge town there were occassional homeless people along the pacific beach boardwalk that being said we were never uncomfortable right across from the hotel are condos that are starting at 750000 the hotel was really convenient to la jolla and to seaworld we loved that we stayed right on the beach and could hear the ocean we paid 15 day to park in their garage under the hotel they even had music playing in the garage that was relaxing i found the convenience of the parking well worth the 15 this was such a great value we would definitely go back in a heart beat,5.0
learning lessons from highend chains,a tremendous hotel the like of which we would never see in europe certainly not at this price space comfort well equipped rooms a choice of pools an impressive spa and a wellequipped gym with a consistently high quality standard of service throughout details have been looked after and lessons learned from the sometimes antiseptic feel of the highend chains the food is excellent with the addison worth a visit in itself the golf course is fantastically maintained and tuition is handson and effective an instant favourite,5.0
very beautiful old san francisco hotel,"this hotel is very beautiful to walk into there is real tiffany glass above the checkin and fantastic chandelliers throughout the main floor the room i stayed in was somewhat small the bathroom a remodel from the 60s or 70s but very clean and adequate bed was very comfortable and that really counts and the window opened i like real air
the hotel is steps away from bart and muni and streetcars i did not have a rental car nor did i miss having one parking fees in san francisco are hideously high
the drawback is the neighborhood but i wonder if the police dont take care of the financial district do they really watch any place walking to and from the warfield theatre i passed by plenty of homeless people andor drug dealers but nobody threatened me
i think the staff is very nice and efficient
and i think the restaurant is fantastic a real chef not a cook runs the kitchen and the menu items are creative and expertly preparedchef actually met us in the lobby and informed us of his newest creations how could we refuse
oh yes i will most definitely return",5.0
great views clean room convenient walk to la live,"as a preface i travel to a limited degree to review rock concerts and have begun to include hotel and resort reviews as well which i am republishing here is modified form this review is for the westin bonaventure hotel  suites in los angeles during my recent los angeles trip february 2012
room typeclass traditional room
date february 710 2012
overall rating 45
this trip was explicitly to attend two concert events  one at club nokia and the other one in hollywood i lived and worked in los angeles for many years while i was in graduate school so im really familiar with it since club nokia is part of la live i thought it made sense to find a hotel that is within walking distance of la live which put me downtown i considered the marriott and the ritzcarlton that are part of la live but they were much more expensive compared with the westin bonaventures hotwire price
i ended up deciphering a hidden discounted offering on one website to purchase on another and found that the westin bonaventure was the hotel being offered within that class range for a highly discounted cost off the base rate and booked it
so the hotel has valet parking but it is an additional 35 per night if you dont mind walking a block or two i noticed that there appeared to be some other public parking alternatives that would be cheaper i ended up using the valet which is underground and you walk down a hallway adorned with movie poster one sheets of films shot at and around the hotel see photos below and up an escalator toward the main entry level where the front desk is located
checkin was quick and otherwise unremarkable i had originally booked two nights but one of my events was canceled and rescheduled i asked if i could add a night at the discounted price and was told they couldnt sell rooms at that price but the guy at the front desk looked in his computer to see their occupancy for the desired night and more or less indicated that if i went on that reseller website again i would likely be able to add the third night at the same reduced rate when i went up to my room i was able to do this and add it on
i was actually really excited to check out the elevators as there is a scene with arnold schwarzenegger in true lies where he goes up one of the elevators on horseback the gentleman at the front desk was able to direct me to the exact elevator i was seeking
as for the room itself i had the basicbase room and was pleased that it was on one of the higher floors better views while on the small side it was very clean and nicely appointed as ive learned to expect from westin properties
maybe because it is an older property the shower and bed are maybe not as heavenly as some other westin properties but overall the room suited my needs perfectly traveling alone with kingsized bed and computer desk internet connectivity via wifi was good but not spectacular
for me the best bonus of the room was the view most of the outward facing wall is glass floor to ceiling as the view was spectacular particularly at night
there are some amenities in the hotel that i just didnt have the time to use  restaurant bar etc
as noted i had come to la for a concert at la live and found that it was definitely a reasonable walking distance from the westin bonaventure  maybe too far for some peoples taste but i walked back and forth several times and i dont think it took more 15 minutes
overall i dont have any complaints at all though it would be nice if valet parking was included but i knew from my research ahead of time that was a cost to factor into the overall value proposition of the stay when i attend a future event at la live i would likely return to the bonaventure unless there is a special deal at one of the competing properties",4.0
hello does anyone work here,everything at this hotel seems slow and staff are nonexistent checkin was slow despite an empty lobby room service doesnt answer room is ok but ac is a noisy unit like the kind found in motels this is my second stay and last was the same,2.0
great location  relaxing but fun just dont go during peak times,"location and backdropviews were excellent they have a few pools lazy river and waterfall ensuring plenty of room got an upgrade on our internet price when we arrived at the front desk  that was a bonus and really made us apprciate the hotel even more its actions like this which will ensure that if given an opportunity we would go back 
i think we were there during their low season even though it was our summer holiday  because its so hot there were not the same crowds  only small complaint would be the indifference of some of the staff attached to the lazy river and managing the pool service  though it wasnt terrible they appeared to not want to be there other staff could not do enough for you
walked to the irish bar and mexican across the road and both were great the bar was more like a sports bar and would highly recommed for the food service and portions we were there on fish night which meant dh was given unlimited portions of fish
hotel is near the salt river where we did tubing a few times highly recommend it if you have access to a car",4.0
location is good rooms suck,"the palmet hotel website descibes itself as an elegent art deco hotelit isnt while the location is greatits one block from s michigan ave and art institute of chicago the rooms are tiny and oldand has a staff that borders on arrogant
i booked online specifically asking for a king size bed and paid an additonal  10 per night for it and yet when i checked in it was a battlethe check in staff tried hard to push me into a smaller bed  it was the chicago marathon weekend and i had to argue to get a room that i was paying for i am almost tempted to think they tried to bully me into this thinking i was a desi it was only when i gave them my us passport  is when they shut up the room was tiny the bathrooms smallno free internet and it takes them forever to get luggage to and from you room
the hotel is old with noisy train lines and traffic
the positives were the helpful concierge the locationi would not stay here again",3.0
great family friendly vacation,"i went to the fhp at ghirardelli square with extended family and this is a great property for those traveling with friends or family that want a two bedroom with a livingdining room we saw a lot of three generation travelers at breakfast and location is very touristy right next to fishermans wharf 
the rooms are very quaint and comfortable with a great view of the ocean and beautiful red brick walls 
the fairmont has great amenities like an escalade that will take you back and forth for about 2 miles around the hotel but be prepared to wait for it 
if you like fine dining make sure to check out gary danko a mere 2 blocks from the hotel",5.0
cant wait to return to the london nyc,absolutely overthetop experience from beginning to end not the least expensive spot in town but i defy you to find a hotel of this caliber that offers suites of this size at lower prices you wont since the hotel is freshly renovated every inch of the property is spotless  fresh we had a london suite on the 17th floor which was silent when the windows were closed our suite had a parlor which was separated from the bedroom by a small entryway  a very welllit bathroom which was enormous the huge mirrors on the bathroom wall were separated by fabulous light panels that made makeup application a breeze in addition the shower area was 9 x 4 with a rain shower type fixture on one end and a shower massage fixture on the other there was also a euro handheld fixture so the bases were covered regarding your showering options the bed offered super deluxe pillowtop comfort and the pillows were fab the linens were very high threadcount sateen the ambiance is minimalistelegant in the suites  throughout the hotel didnt try the restaurantbar loved every moment that we were there  look forward to returning hopefully their discounted rate will continue forever,5.0
big hotel in an excellent location needs some modernisation,stayed in early june for a conference huge hotel with helpful staff and decent size rooms beds were also very comfortable i had a nice view of michigan ave magnificent mile the bathroom though was surprisingly tiny overall it needs some renovation to compete with the likes of trump tower the breakfast on the first day was a bit of a disaster it was just so chaotic the food itself was pretty decent tho decent size pool and gym for those who are keen to keep fit i would look to the newer places to stay next time tho,3.0
great location,we stayed here in august with 4 adults  4 kids 468 10 great location because it is an easy walk to inner harbor the down side was they had no pool  bar closed early we wanted to bring a glass of wine up to room when kids went to sleep but it closed 89 we did get 2 rooms that had an outer door that closed from the hallway so we had great privacy rooms were very clean and breakfast was nice the front desk was helpful when asked about restaurants  directions we left our car parked the whole time  walked to inner harbor aquarium childrens museum and even to little italy would stay here again,4.0
loved the omni shoreham,the omni shoreham was the venue for the us chamber of commerce  small business summit this hotel is amazing i had a very spacious king room this is a fullservice hotel with a topnotch restaurant barlounge nice outdoor pool for a city hotel gift shop jewelry store and large fitness center staff was professional and very courteous the location is great  close to the zoo subway and georgetown i would definitely consider staying here again although its  includes free wifi access if youre an omni rewards member,5.0
good value great people,recent renovations and upgrades make ones stay very comfortable while also offering green options for the room but it is the attentive professional and very pleasant personnel at the hotel that make ones stay enjoyable jj elizabeth and tezelia at the front desk provide excellent service always and stacy in the front office is equally laudable for these reasons i have been a repeat guest during 4 years of business travel to charlotte,5.0
another kimpton gem,"solamar is by far one of the nicest kimpton properties ive stayed in greeted by very friendly staff who were helpful in getting me into my room 3 hours before the 300 checkin room was huge so much room to spread out bathroom was very spacious and bright speakman shower heads bed was immensely comfortable view was looking out over the 4th floor rooftop pool and bar 
wine hour from 56 was great and then moseyed up to the bar where john the bartender took care of my beverage needs pool and bar area are bustling around 7 but a great place to catch some rays and enjoy some conversation 
i will definitely make this my san diego hotel of choice after my stay here",4.0
great hotel cheap price,we were really worried after reading so many horrible reviews about this hotel before our trip to nyc but the hotel ended up to be really nice the room was clean 16th floor though it was a little shabby the furniture in the room were new and the bed was ok bathroom was very clean and had fresh towels almost every day the services in the hotel and in the lobby were also great though we sometimes needed to wait for some time to get to our safe deposit box but hey they have 1700 rooms altogether the hotel is really a bargain just dont expect plaza for that price,4.0
brilliant location,"i stayed at this hotel last year on my first trip to new york and thought it was brilliantly placed as did my boyfriend whos been to nyc several times we were able to walk absolutely everywhere and it was great to be slightly away from the madness of times square whenever we walked through there we said it was nice how calm our street was in comparison 
wed asked for a high room and were given a lovely room on the very top floor with a fantastic view of the chrysler building the room was really big and the bed one of the comfiest ive slept in all of the staff were really helpful and friendly would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it",4.0
nice stay for business,i recently stayed at the magnolia while on business in denver the location is great close to light rail the 16th street mall and all the fun stuff downtown the service at the front dest was excellent and efficient the building is older and the long hallways can be a little confusing the room was clean and nice enjoyed the nice couch for lounging and the bathroom was very nice the evening happy hour cookies and milk and continental breakfast at no extra cost are great perks if staying downtown and looking for a nice place to stay that isnt too expensive this is the place for you,4.0
pretty nice place,we just got back from a week long stay at this hotel which happened to be our honeymoon we had to change our original florida plans due to the hurricanes neither of us had any major complaints the staff was excellent as was our room we were on the 8th floor overlooking the charles river the suites have ample space and the beds are perfect once you climbed into the down comforters and pillows it was difficult to get out the concierge would do anything for us and was well prepared to dish out any information concerning the local area among the things we didnt like were the 20 per day parking fee i thought this was a little steep for a paying guest at the hotel the only other complaint i have is the entranceexit to the hotel if you drive to the hotel you will curse entering or exiting the property we rented a car for the week but after being there one day we found it completely unnecessary the hotel offers free shuttles to areas of interest and cab fare to other places is reasonable plus you dont have to deal with the insanely packed streets of boston,4.0
a bit old but service is great,"first the positives the staff are great friendly and knowledgeable they seem to really enjoy their job and want to help guests the hotel is also fairly clean and the rooms are quite large they have a business centre swimming pool and gym which are small but adequate the breakfast is continentalnothing spectacular but adequate for your needs
i guess the hotel seems a bit dated but fine for any 3 to 3 12 star hotel the neighbourhood and some guests are a bit eclectic it is not unsafe but i would describe some guests as edgyartsy the hotel has a funky vibeagain not bad but just different
all in all it is a great hotel if your expectation is correct it is not a four seasons but very adequate there is noise from the highway but not really disturbing some of the appliancestaps can be noisydripping but again easy to fix i think the staff really turn this from an ok hotel to a quite a decent place to stay",4.0
wonderful hotel with great service,my husband and i just returned from an overnight stay in the city to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary the chatwal was a perfect choice we were very pleased with the service the accommodations and the location of this hotel the hotel was very thoughtful and provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates in honor of our anniversary im hoping to return again in october with my 5 year old son as it is also a very safe facility,5.0
very nice time,"we stayed on the 25th floor and the same week the dallas cowboys had their training week my stepdad had some meeting there
the athletes stayed there  my family and i got to meet a few trainers 
it had a very gorgeous view of the riverwalk it was tad bit expensive though but they have a pool half indooroutdoor the hot tub was very relaxing  they have a neat workout gym 
the beds were ohso comfy i even napped in jeans 
we had a balcony  got the gorgeous view of the riverwalk its really neat at night the location is great the elevators are fast lobby smells good valet parking nice staff clean room i cant complain really id say go for it",5.0
comfortable stay,weve stayed here a few time while visiting our daughter at school rooms are clean quiet and comfortable unfortunately this sheraton doesnt run any specialsthey dont need to the hotel is a short walk to both penn and drexel,4.0
2nd time is not a charm,"wrote a review this summer about my displeasure with this westin got stuck there again this time via hotwire which booked me at the intercontinental but then switched me to the westin same pet peeve staff who dont care why would they tell me the mall opens at 900 am when it opens at 1000 am tired bathrooms and loud long running toilets the kicker is waking up and having not an ounce of water hotelwide
yes it was only for two hours but it just is indicative of the state of disrepair at this property they offered me a free night and i passed it up wont stay there for free 
all in all a solid 3 star hotel max which is why i gave it an average rating it would be an average hampton inn not a westin shame on you westin sell this dog and keep our confidence",3.0
no one should stay in this dive,"to say we were disappointed with this hotel would be the understatement of the century first of all we arrived to find there was no elevator despite having 3 floors in the building and as we had a lot of luggage this was not much appreciated the second we walked into the room it was clear we were staying in quite a well kept establishment as they had saved us the hassle of turning doorknobs by ripping them off each door the beds came equipped with filthy sheets each sporting brown stains what these came from we are not sure but one can speculate
the state of the beds was second only to how uncomfortable they were particularly the fold out bed we were given this particular bed collapsed as soon as it was unfolded and upon telling the manager about it we were given the response yeah that ones broken is it is it really my god thank you for enlightening me
after one night the inevitable happened cockroaches
this of course didnt fill us with confidence about the rest of our stay so we decided to capture a roach and show it to the hotel staff to see if they would do anything rest assured they were quite helpful they looked at the cockroach with a very ive obviously seen numerous cockroaches in this hotel before look and said oh thats scary needless to say we will not be going back and we feel sorry for anyone else that has to endure this hell hole there are phenomenally better hotels for around the same price even closer to downtown we strongly suggest you choose one of those",1.0
nice place and good deal,"we liked our room and the pillows were not as bad as some other reviewers have indicated it says something about the hotel when the worst thing i can think of is the hard pillows we really liked the lack of check in and invisible staff but found out they are around if you really need help
we have relatives in boston and plan on staying at st botolph again",5.0
location location location,"stayed march 14  17 2008 the tuscin inn is a great hotel depending your room location location is the best everything is in walking distance shopping etc the weather is great just a little cold and windy but no rain there were sunny days on our trip walgreens was a great store and purchase clothing less than the vendor on the street were offering 
i had a government rate which was very good for the room selection we had a double beds for the first 2 nights and a suite for the next two nights the room are exact has they appear on the wedsite made our reservations on best westerncom the room 454 had double beds and no view the closet are very small but the room was comfortable when checking in remember to asked for the bar key so you can store beverages in the refrigerator room 402 was the suite large bathrooom no closet space nice room fireplace but the sofa bed was terrible in addition the heater did not work so i had to order additional blankets to get warmeven received a slight cold upon return room 402 did have a view they were willing to change room but we had already uppacked and did not realize the heater was not working until our 2nd night did not asked for a discount they told me to contact manager who was unable at the time each time i inquired the corceige was excellent and some of the hotel staff did care and others did not may be the government rate the coffee in the morning was great did not attend the wine party did not eat at the restaurant but room service was great if you book a room asked for the courtyard view if possibe location is everything at this site everything you need is right in the area pier 39 and other activities are in walking distance do you go the aquarium not worth the price
grayline tours were great took the 10 per person on the ride around the bay best price the battleship was a great tour also did not do alcaraz tour due to the kids overall the stay at the tuscan inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service there are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service we traveled with 2 adults and 2 children",5.0
great hotelwould stay again,great hotel superb location and really helpful friendly staff the room was immaculate comfortable and tastefully decorated the rooftop pool was faba little cool maybe but very refreshing with plenty of loungers and chairs and it provided welcome down time for my kids we had a meal in the restaurant and also in room dining and both were excellent quality we would definately stay here again,5.0
great hotel not the best location,the hotel itself is lovely fantastic breakfast with everything you can imagine the managers reception was the best we have had at an embassy suites hote the room itself was very spacious clean and i would definately say this is more plush than other embassy suites unfortunately you do have to pay for internet in the rooms and the free internet lounge was often fullthe location is great for the airport but not particularly convenient for downtown boston the underground is about a 510 minute walk and for adults the return fare is not especially cheap with children you may want a more convenient hotel if you are exploring the city what i would say is the hotel overall was very good value for 5 people we couldnt find anything of a similar price,4.0
this has to be my favourite hotel in california,i loved this hotel  it is such a little hidden gem very cosy and beautiful there are fresh cookies and cake available in the hotel reception breakfast is a lovely affair with fresh hot food brought out all the time in the evening there is a little drinksfood reception this is a great time to meet other guests and share ideas i will definitely return again to stay the staff were very friendly and helpful our room was basic but there is something about this hotel that is magical i hope you agree if you get to stay there,5.0
great hotel great location,i have stayed at this hotel more than 5 times during the last few years if you want to be part of the west village i know of no better choice the staff is friendly and helpful the rooms are typical nysize the entire facility is clean theres a lot going on in this unique central area and the washington square hotel makes you feel like part of the neighborhood,5.0
nice place but service,"for a relatively cheap quite clean place the drury inn in denver certainly appeased us they provided pizza and some snacks during the evening which was certainly welcome and very much appreciated
when we checked in the lady greeted us and advised that we could get a king room for two nights at 54 us each night
i was elated given that id read pretty decent reviews about this hotel so i sign up we go to our room everything is fine
the pizza the popcorn and the pool all great
on our final morning when we were checking out they placed the bill under the door a subtle reminder that we need to leave and had charged us 54 for the first night and 96 for the second
when querying this the woman treated me as though i was lying and that i must be dreaming if id get the same room for 54 on a saturday night after much frustration and complaining she eventually knocked it down to 64 for the second night
i was not particularly happy but it certainly was a lot better than the original price we left and probably wont return the place was good but the service was not so
having said that denver was awesome",3.0
good choice in river north,"we have stayed here on several occasions and i enjoy this hotel
i like that you can walk to shopping theater good restaurants lively bars hob so depending on what you are in the mood for it is nearby the public transportation is only a couple of blocks away and if you use the attached parking you get a bit of a discount it is a bit expensive
the rooms are a really good size for downtown and very clean",4.0
great location average hotel,"we stayed at this sheraton for a conference my husband was attending the hotel is located on the river between the lake and the miracle mile the location is a great starting point to shop and sightsee the hotel itself is clean and the staff was friendly our room was average with the bare essentials it was a decent size but there were no perks basic shampoo conditioner and soap no bathrobes or even cotton balls
the staff was very helpful they provided directions and even a pass to skip the line at a local chicago style pizza place btw ordering a pizza from malnatis or ginos is cheaper than room service and they deliver concierge will give you a list of who delivers",4.0
very nice and clean hotel,very nice and clean centrally located to all major subway stops they are going thru lobby renovation so the lobby might not look to appealing but i understand they are improving rooms clean and spacious very quiet check in was a breeze and guy was amazing gave us top floor and a couple of travel tips thanks hyatt for making our trip to boston amazing,5.0
conference meeting space  perfect,i had a work conference at the sheraton crescent and everything was done perfectly the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating everything was very clean and the whole place smelled wonderful yeah i know it sounds funny to say that but there is something nice about walking into a place that just smells great thank you sheraton for making our work conference there a perfect setting,5.0
did not even get past the initial phone call  wont book here,"i just called the hotel to ask a couple of questions i could not find anything on their website if wifi was complimentary and i needed to know if wifi was only in the lobbycommon area or in the rooms also i have been burned before with this distinction
i called and asked the front desk if there was a charge for internet access i was told no one word answer so i asked if wifi was available in the rooms or if it was just in the common areas her response i just told you it was free what more do you want
ok thenif i am getting attitude before i even get there this is not a place i want to stay yes she may have been having a bad day but i have 20 people that i need to put someplace for 5 nights and i need to know they will be treated well
sorry hampton you lost our business from the initial phone call",1.0
new sf hotel,"we returned from our 2 night stay at the hotel vital which opened recently 
location it is located close to the freeway so it easy to find but so close that you hear traffic noise it is right across the street from the newly remodeled ferry building which includes restaurants and shops and down the street from pier 39 
service upon making reservations we had to switch days and they were not especially friendly over the phone but not rude either i suppose efficient would be appropriate the rooms are significantly more expensive during the week than the weekend which is the opposite of most places we visit our checkin was very pleasant and we did arrive four hours before checkin we were greeted and to our surprise promptly given an available room 
hotel the hotel has a modern zenlike feel the hallways are very dimly lit which may not be plus for many people the artwork and lavendar pieces in the hallway are a nice touch our room was average sized with a great bed and nice linens flatscreen tv cd player with four cds bathroom amenties from the fresh co our view was of a building wall but if you are able to get a view of the water it would be amazing my husband hated the bathroom door as it is more visually appealing than suited for privacy 
restaurantbar we did not eat at the restaurant although the menu looked great and it was crowded the bar was nice and had a similar feel as the hotel with great service even though it was a busy night 
gym we had the room to ourselves with a couple cardio machinestvs and free weights small room with no windows
overall we had a nice experience but were able to get an introductory rate we would most likely look elsewhere for the current price",4.0
very average room not best location,i was a tad disappointed with this hotel lobby beautiful actually stunning but to to room which was supposed to be big enough to fit a portable bed if we decided we friend  i didnt want to share a bed as they had no twins available but getting back to room size we could barely fit extra rack for suit case let alone another bedas for location well its a lovely view perched on top of snob hill but makes exploring a chore because the road to it is soooooo steep had to take heels off walking down as its that steep so not a handy easily accessible location i would have perfered bottom of hill near union square cheaper less impressive lobby service was ok but hardly worth the  for the tiny room oh did i mention window in room looking at wall,3.0
considering the cost and location this is a good place to stay,"if you are only after an affordable place to stay in a top location go for this hotel we were out all day during our stay so we knew we only needed a bed to stay in my husban and 3yr old and i slept comfortably in the bed we were on a higher floor facing the street and did not hear much noise 
 its perfectly located near union square the bart stop though an uphill walk the cable car stop as well we took the bart easily from the airport and within 30mins arrived at powell st station and walked some blocks to the hotel the room we had had two double beds and large clean bathroom flat screen tv some people complained on reviews about the breakfast but if you are getting pastries for free there isnt much to complain about free wifi in the lobby 
once again if you want a fancier experience go for a nicer hotel as this is the basics no hairdryer but apart from that it is good some staff members need to smile a little more",4.0
beautiful hotel perfect for our honeymoon,"we stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon tour of the west coast in april this was the best hotel we stayed in  we absolutely loved it it is very different to the modern hotels we stayed in on other parts of the trip  this one one is grand and old style with afternoon drinks and an actual key for your room the staff were lovely and very helpful the location is stunning  pacific heights is the most beautiful area and you are surrounded by traditional houses and views of the bay sf is very hilly so do expect a few walks up and down steep roads  but it is totally worth it follow pacific avenue right down and you are in china town which is great fun
the room was lovely and big and had a luxurious bathroom  you really felt you were staying in a big old housein the 1940s
the hotel has a lounge where you can get tea and coffee 247 and home made biscotti in the afternoons the breakfast was included and was a nice buffet with plenty of options
i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city  but especially if you are looking for some quirky charm and tradition this was just the perfect place for a honeymoon escape",5.0
great stay as expected,"after reading the many many positive reviews i didnt have any worries about booking a stay here for a weekend getaway w a friend andas expectedwe had a very good experience the lobby is small but very sleek  modern every staff member was friendly and helpful our room was clean  comfortable even though the hotel is in a great location just a block  half off michigan ave it was too cold for us wimps to walk around so we cabbed instead valet parking is only 9 more and worth it because the self park is on the next street over and down a little plus it offers inout privileges
we had reserved a room w two doubles and asked to be away from the elevators since my friend  i are both light sleepers we were told that all the doubles are by the elevators  the kings make up the rest of the rooms on each floor but were assured that there was soundproofing so we shouldnt hear the elevator noise we were happy to find this true we didnt hear a peep from the elevators just the crying baby next door
a breakfast buffet is included which had all the standard cereal yogurt bagels juice etc plus hard boiled eggs oatmeal a waffle maker  batter and breakfast sandwiches  miniquiches that you could heat in the microwave
its not a 5 star plush hotel w fancy robes and such but you cant beat the cleanliness  value for the money here
the only negative was that we came back after a long saturday night out  were planning to watch a payperview movie but the tvs do not have that option oh wellminor detail 
thanks fairfield i will definitely be back",5.0
waste of money,dont waste your money this hotel is overpriced dont let the breakfast fool you not worth it the hotel is dirty the staff could care less about you just a bad experience one good thing it was cold so we could shop right there or take the metro to get out of there you may want to take your own sheets since the sheets in our room were dirty we complained and it took forever to get new ones the shower was not cleaned again the staff took no action the once nice staff was at breakfast who seated us they are more interested in talking to each other that you there are plenty of places to stay take some time and do your research,1.0
not much quality at this inn,checkin was alright friendly staff park in front of room and was 3 min from where i had to be in the morning but all downhill from there no fridge or micro gross beds desk falling apart with sticky crap on the leg when i went to prop it up with a phonebook looked like dang oil spots on the carpet internet actually worked great but the tv was not a flatscreen one serious problem was sharing a parking lot with a very seedylooking strip club not a place youd want to stay with kids also nasty fake eyelashes on the mirror property unfortunately had the feel of a cheap brothel at least it was cheap,2.0
cheap and cheerful,we stayed in the baldwin hotel in november 2012 and were generally happy with our stay the hotel itself is located on the edge of san franciscos china town and feels safe comfortable and quiet it is also close to union square and the main shopping district you will need to jump onto the famous trams if you are wanting to visit other sites however though these are just around the corner the rooms are a little dated but were clean and tidy and the staff were always happy to help us with our queries,4.0
great location nice hotel rooms not quite as grand as in the past,"mellia the concierge made my stay very knowledgable and friendly the other hotel staff could take pointers from the two female concierges they know how to provide topnotch service
when you enter the public spaces will wow you the rooms are nice but dont feel as grand as the public spaces large flat screen tvs are nice fridge safe plenty of storage space walls thin temperature difficult to regulate beds comfy
great location muni across the street close to union square museums restaurants etc
i recommend the tour to wine country the concierge can set it up for you take the smaller of the two tours
if the price is right id stay at the palace again",4.0
simply lovely,"i was in town for a conference and this hotel was picked by a colleague for its location and fair price i was thrilledalways loving the w brand
 this hotel did not disappoint 
first walking in the floral scent is lovely and inviting i love the modern design water features and fresh flowers everywhere the reception area and bar have a cool modern edge the staff were very friendly and helpful storing luggage and help at conciergeaka whatever desk
our room was a good size for nyc 2 beds and it fit luggage it was modern and clean bed and linens were top rate the bathroom was complete with tub shower and fantastic bliss products
location is great for the tourist and jatvis conference attendee yes there is some trafficsiren noise but common anywhere in nyc overall i highly recommend",4.0
the very best,i often stay at the st regis in san francisco and find it to be absolutely the best the facilities are excellent but what really separates it from the rest is the level of service and attention all staff is extremely helpful and capable it is my hotel of choice in a city with other very good hotels,5.0
friendly staff comfortable rooms great free breakfast,i stayed here one night during a work trip and got a great aaa rate the staff was very friendly and as requested i was given a quiet room on an upper floor there were cookies and candy canes twas the season at the time at the front desk at certain hours the continental breakfast was better than most offered at hotels and included herbed eggs that tasted fresh and were delicious the coffee something important to me was great as well the location of the hotel is near the convention center and chinatown which is known for great restaurants etc the hotel is also within walking distance of some notable attractions as well the valet parking fee and tax was the only thing i found objectionable though this is a common problem in dc,4.0
stay some where else,the rooms are very very small my bathroom is bigger not a good location for families there were no in room amenities glasses ice bucket towels etc the parking is not at the hotel and is 3000 per 24 hour period the staff is very snotty and not helpful i would not stay there again and i would not recommend this hotel,1.0
wonderful stay at the chancellor,my husband and i are just back from our first trip to san francisco i chose the chancellor based on reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed i emailed the manager wes tyler several times prior to our trip with questions and he always responded promptly which was a nice touch im not sure one would get this at a larger hotel everything about our stay at the chancellor more than met our expectations we had booked shuttle service from the airport with lorries which i found on the hotels website and which im sure saved us considerable time as we were unfamiliar with getting around san francisco we arrived early in the morning and our room was not yet ready but we had expected this and left our bags to go on an alcatraz tour when we returned we went to our room which as requested prior to our arrival was a corner room with a view of union square room 1203 surprise waiting for us was a bottle of sparkling wine two chancellor wine glasses giftwrapped photo frame and nice note from the hotel staff congratulating us on our recent marriage what a way to welcome your guests the room was painted in lovely shades of green and taupe with nice prints on the walls the bed had a soft white comforter and many pillows television armchairs dressers lamps etc were more than adequate the bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies for the four nights we were there the bathroom was plenty big for the both of us and wellappointed with soap shampoo lotion tissues cotton balls and qtips hair dryer and makeup mirror plus the rubber ducky was a cute touch the ceiling fan and open windows provided more than enough ventilation the large closet was much appreciated as was the iron ironing board and inroom safe the room was very quiet at all times and street noise was not bothersome all of the staff that we encountered were efficient friendly and helpfulparticularly steve helped us with restaurant reservations susie answered transportation questions and arranged shuttle service back to sfo and matt brought our bags to the room everyone that we saw truly seemed to enjoy working at the hotel we visited both the bar and restaurant and had pleasant experiences along with moderately priced tasty mealsdrinks as many reviewers have previously noted the location of the chancellor cant be beat for just about anything a tourist would want to do in san francisco particularly shopping and dining if we ever return to san francisco which i sincerely hope to do because i fell in love with it there is no way i would stay anywhere other than the chancellor thank you,5.0
i will alwyays stay at the st gregory hotel,i stay at the st gregory hotel for the second time and i must admit that it is great m bah was very helpful during check in we came in at 1 am in the morning and was upgraded to a suite for 129 we will always return if you need a good hotel in a nice neighborhood stay at the st gregory hotel the rooms are very specious with kitchen there is a business center that is free to use,5.0
not fancy but worth the perks,this hotel is just around the corner from the main times square which is great because it puts you in a convenient location without actually being right on the most crowded noisy street in nyc the hotel is small and the lobbyrooms are not anything extravagant it reminded me more of a european hotel in its size for us that was totally fine but if youre only interested in space and want the newest fanciest hotel with a view then this is not the one you want however if you want a friendly staff a cleanquiet room free breakfast free winecheesefruitveggies every evening and 24 access to coffeeice waterbaked goods then this is the hotel for you  you also get free wifi and access to a fitness center should you want it though we did not use these options the hotel was nice enough to put a complimentary bottle of wine in our room for our anniversary which we appreciated also the cafe on the second floor where all the free stuff is has a nice little outdoor terrace that we enjoyed sitting on at night,5.0
spotlessly clean different kind of hotel,"keep in mind  ive never stayed at a club quarters hotel despite my 60 nightsyear in hotels that having been said i was made to feel quite foolish by the front desk staff when i didnt know that checkin was via an automated kiosk and not from the front desk attendants regardless i wouldnt let that spoil my visit  the hotel itself is just a few steps off wall street making it a great location monday  friday and totally desolate friday night through sunday the hotel restaurant and bar were closed but there is a duane reade across the street with limited hours and south street seaport is a few blocks away
the hallways are very narrow making it difficult to balance a laptop bag and suitcase while attempting to get to your room big perk  chilled purified water stations on every floor adjacent to a closet with extra pillows blankets and ironing boards the room itself was adequate for a solo traveler double bed desk with ergo chair flatscreen tv decently sized bathroom with nice toiletries and good wifi everything in the hotel is spotlessly clean and the tvcomputer lounge on the main floor is a nice perk bizarrely enough the cost for a 3 pm checkout is 35  ive never seen that before but i suppose its just part of a limitedservice hotel
net if i cant get in to any of my usual hotels in nyc or if i really need to be on wall street i would probably consider the club quarters again",3.0
good room for the price,"pear tree is a good place if you are on a budget and need a room for a good value this is a slightly older property but still well maintained the staff is very courteous and helpful check in was easy and quick the hotel is located on 410 not far from northstar mall there are a few restaurants close by and a short car ride will get you to many more restaurants as we were there in the winter we didnt get to try the pool 
the rooms  they are pretty roomy and our room had the minifridge and microwave the bed was reasonably comfortable i wish it was a little softer but for a weekend it will suffice the bathroom is average sized and like most hotels seems to fog up quickly if you take a hot shower the floor gets slippery so definately law down a towel to keep you from slipping 
continental breakfast  this was the best thing about the hotel they had a good supply of food the bagels were fresh and the waffle maker a good touch it gets packed especially the waffle maker stationbecause everyone staying there eats the breakfast so expect a crowd 
building  it was nice and tidy not extravagant or posh but wellmaintained and not musty smelling like many ramadas it could use some new carpet in the hallways and maybe in the rooms too however the carpet is an old style but not dirty or dingy the building is well insulated from sounds and it was surprisingly quiet 
this hotel is a good deal if the price is right i recommend it if you are looking for a nice room and are not concerned with needing a lot of luxuries",3.0
an excellent newly renovated property,my husband  i stayed here as we had a 7am departure from san diego airport as i was unfamiliar with the proximity of downtown etc we thought it would be a convenient base overall i was extremely happy with the newly branded holiday inn express and the value we received for just under 130nt incl tax the hotel is 100 located parallel to the freeway so i requested a room facing away from the freeway and jose was very happy to oblige when we checked in just after 8pm in fact jose was friendly attentive and helpfulwhich is not the usual response when you check into a property so late in the day we had rm 347 and you could not hear a peep from the freeway the one complaint my husband had was that the airconditioner was very noisy to make matters worse it kept turning itself onoff all night which was noisy and frustrating we couldnt seem to figure out how to keep it constantly onif management could somehow fix this i think it would certainly help i would suggest bringing ear plugs if youre a light sleeper we had a rental car from enterprise and it was literally down the road so it was very convenient so early in the morning the holiday inn express also had a little convenience store in the lobby which was open 24 hours so you could easily grab some water or some snacks to tide you over the renovation was really well done  new carpet furniture microwave kettle tv duvet set etceven the bathroom had been preened still keeping in with some of the retro outfit though all in all i was very happy with the holiday inn express,4.0
warm and cosy room,"some people here have rated the wrong hotel you can not complain about the restaurant or bartender when it doesnt have a restaurant or a bar i have come across other reviews for the wrong hotel and im definitely going to use tripadvisor very carefully now its not necessarily accurate
anyway this is a good place to stay the room is warm and cosy the bed very comfortable the breakfast is nice too i would stay here again any time the only drawback for me is that there is no restaurant nearby if i had a car no problem theres plenty of parking too the free internet made up for it thats always a bonus for me",5.0
location location,in south park near staples center and other tourist attractions great service nice rooms and very reasonably priced even saw p diddy and his entourage in the hotel lobby,4.0
modern clean great location great service,my husband and i went out for a date night here were in our 30s so was most of the other guests young hip friendly front desk was helpful and efficient hotel room was beautiful and clean and price was reasonable would book again i was expecting a dump after reading other reviews so i was compelled to write about my experience oh and bed was crazy comfy,5.0
its an awful hotel,the room we got was dark and dingy due to a blown out ceiling light and the carpet felt and looked dirty the ceiling was peeling and patched several times the bedding had holes in it and the beds were hard one of the shower taps was loose and you could see the holes the taps came out of the wall i thought we were in the hood theres signs on the hotel entrance door about the amount of the cash kept in the lobby and a bullet hole in our rooms window i would never stay here again the pictures are deceiving,1.0
birthday weekend made perfect by helix associates,we were celebrating a 30th birthday in dc and hotel helix really pulled out all the stops to make it perfect for us great location friendly associates and cool decor we were welcomed with framed pictures of the birthday girls loved ones complimentary champagne was brought to room as well as extra pillows sheets and additional animal print robes upon request no special request was overlooked we will be back,5.0
please please stay somewhere else,for all of you looking for a budget hotel with friendly staff and clean beds please look elsewhere the ladies if you can call them that who staffed the windows were beyond rude i honestly could not believe how selfabsorbed and obnoxious they were my sheets had what i called mystery stains all over them as did the top cover and spare blanket the sheets looked like theyd been laundered but the covers looked like theyd never seen the washer i barely touched them and you should do the same they were filthy on the contrary to other reviews my bathroom was ok it could have been worse as a matter of fact it was a lot like the dorm bathroom i used in college thank god for flip flops and lysol the tv was about 20 years old with bad reception and barely 4 channels but you dont come to nyc to sit in your room and watch tv one great thing about this hotel is that if you arent leaving ny until late in the day and need a place to store your things you can pay 1bag to store them at the hotel also the hotel is in an excellent location just a block away from times square and the 42nd street subway but there are other hotels in the area that offer better service and nice clean rooms your best bet is to go with one of them instead,1.0
pleasant hotel on business,i had business just a block away from this hotel so i decided to give it a try the building contains offices as well so you take separate hotel elevators from the entrance floor to the lobby the lobby is elegant and tasteful you need your room key to go to any hotel floors above lobby level which is a good thing in baltimore my room had a very high ceiling and a very nice bathroom with a stand up glass walled shower and aveda bath products it was a spacious room with a nice flat screen tv the bed was supposed to be a king and maybe it was but it was small in length and my 6 2 frame hung over it not sure it was the bed but i did not sleep well for some reason it happens for kimpton members there was free internet access of course and also 10 for use at the inroom minibar the gym was nice with a decent selection of equipment,4.0
average is a good description,"was here for a conference and stayed in the lowrise section the room was very dated with an odd layout plenty of space but not well used
hotel is very busy a colleague had a wallet stolen from the conference area the fact that the hotel has a loss prevention officer should lead you to believe that this is a common occurence especially given that this is the hotel that alex trebek was in when his room was robbed
the hotel serves its purpose but you might see if you can get in a less dated room and watch your stuff carefully",3.0
will use this hotel again,"great location as close to the subway so makes visiting lots different areas in the city easy having visited several hotels in new york this has good sized rooms is really clean and they are contemporary the sky bar has lovely views over the city and the barman made a mean cocktail
only problem we had whilst staying was one of the lifts wasnt working so we did have to wait sometime for the other lift to visit our floor lol
and i nearly forgot it was lovely and quiet at night how could i forget that ",5.0
ill be back,this was my second stay at the beverly garlands holiday inn the staff has always been courteous pleasant and very attentive the rooms are clean comfortable and beautifully decorated on this trip i ate at the onsite restaurant and was very pleased with the quality of the food i was doubly impressed when room service delivered a hot meal the onsite bar has a great lounge atmosphere that plays music videos on several flat screen tvs i truly enjoyed the pool area especially in the evening when i could sit close to the outdoor fireplace overall it was great experience staying here and im looking forward to my next trip,5.0
holiday trip,this was a holiday trip with family members staying at the hotel it has been redone and is really lovely our dog traveled with us and when booking the room the lady even said she was looking forward to meeting our dog they advertise as dog friendly and they are there is a wonderful walking trail at the hotel that is great for the dogs rooms were very comfortable but the comforters had been washed and should not have and were matted and funny looking for sure they need to change that anyway  all else great breakfast was more than just continental  had some real breakfast food and that was a nice surprise we will be back,5.0
good hotel great location,stayed at the comfort inn manhattan recently the hotel is in a great location only a 2 minute walk to macys and the empire state building just behind the hotel on 34th st rooms very clean very comfortable bed could have had better lighting though breakfast good cereal eggs bagels toast but plastic plates cups and cutlery as earlier posts have said staff very helpful especially mathew staff booked our tours and transport back to jfk brendans also a good place to eat if you want to eat close by would stay again,5.0
one of the best stays in new york city ever,"the affinia 50 hotel has everything going for it for the same price as a room at the hilton or sheraton you can have a clean large onebedroom suite they are basically apartments with a full kitchen large bedroom and the great affinia bed 
 one thing many people dont think about or maybe dont care about is the number of electric outlets in a hotel room well affinia 50 has this covered  i had no problem finding a place to plug in 2 cell phones my moms palm pilot and my tmobile sidekick device
 i think one of the best things about the affinia 50 is the incredibly friendly courteous and professional staff even though i was only there for 2 days i felt as though i had acquired extended family members 
 i would highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to stay there again",5.0
great location,this hotel was in a great location to the wharf and other sites in the city although the rooms are small it was very clean hugo the concierge was very knowledgeable helpful and fun too,4.0
a very pleasant stay in downtown dc,our stay for 2 nights at the normandy was very pleasant the continental breakfast buffet was delicious and our room was comfortable the hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and also within walking distance of the doubledecker sightseeing bus also about 4 blocks from the nearest metro stop conveniently located but also in a very quiet and residential neighborhood derek at the front desk was always courteous knowledgeable and very attentive had a very customerfriendly disposition overall a great stay,4.0
class class class,"this place screams class old school classic motif with paintings and sculptures of us presidents and historical events jackets necessary at all times no jeans all the reviews are pretty accurate so read closely but heres some other stuff to know
great breakfast included in price of room omelet station belgian waffle station best belgian waffle i ever had normal bacon sausage bagels oatmeal pastries cereal etc
25 parking across the street solid price for philadelphia
close to a lot of bars within walking distance
cigar bar and hotel bar are very nice
room is ok normal hotel room nothing special really only critiques would be if you are a light sleeper ask for a room on the inside of the building not sure if its a courtyard or if the rooms just dont have windows because the rooms on the outside are very loud due to street traffic walls are also very thin could hear other peoples wake up calls very clearly
overall great place to stay in philly if you want to stay in style",5.0
sleepy and grumpy but not happy,this hotel is very convenient to graceland and also very quiet but has the most uncomfortable mattresses that i have ever tried to sleep on in my life it felt like i was laying on a big bag of flour needless to say there was little sleeping while i was at this hotel i was shocked to see reviews saying the beds were so comfortable the mattresses are made of foam and are well worn and lumpy the room also smelled loudly of a chemical room spray which greatly bothered me when i returned home my clothes had absorbed that smell i was miserable and glad to leave the hotel lobby was nice and the workers seemed to be working hard to do their jobs but sleeping and breathing are important to me,2.0
cant wait to go back,other reviewers have pretty much said it all we stayed for three nights in february and loved it the staff are exceptionally helful courteous and knowledgable our room was immaculate with a great view the pool was heated just right and the large king size chaises were to die for top it all off with the super location and no less than 75 restaurants you can walk to and the horton plaza seaport village and the ferry to coronado and you have all the makings of a wonderful holiday or business trip,5.0
cool and trendy,"we stayed one night in w times square for a family birthday and broadway show with my two children and parents this hotel is very cool and trendy with a fun entrance and check in arealobby when we tried to check in several hours before check in time one of our rooms was ready however when we got to the room my parents werent happy with the location next to the elevator when i went downstairs to the desk to ask for another room the receptionist not only politely moved us but made the effort to find us connecting rooms and actually upgraded us to a corner room with no extra charge my parents were thrilled with their corner room and we all loved the newly redone and trendy details in both rooms
later in the evening we spent some time at the extremely cool bar in the hotel which was fun and the next morning ate a delicious breakfast at the restaurant downstairs
valet parking was convenient and fast
location is smack in the middle of times square and while this is convenient and fun it is also extremely noisy even on the 48th floor so keep this in mind this city really doesnt sleep people",5.0
be warnedshuttle service stops at 10,booked a night at the crowne plaza north for a quick stay over in columbus because i saw they had an airport shuttle unfortunately the shuttle service stops at 10 the hotel is nowhere near the airport and ended up taking a cab which cost close to 50 from the airport the hotel itself is otherwise average location is quite poor,2.0
great hotel great location,"what a great hotel we were on the 27th floor with an excellent view hotel is next to the prudential and copley place shopping center 1520 min walk to fenway park in case youre attending a red sox game
hotel room was very clean comfortable and the bed was excellent this room really felt like home
the sheraton offers valet parking for 39night quite reasonable considering the location",5.0
trendy hotel in a great location,"this is a beautiful new luxury hotel in an excellent location in downtown boston room was very large and modern with an elegant and spacious bathroom bed was very comfortable and furniture was all very highend service was wonderful and extremely courteous however we found some of the concierges recommendations to be somewhat biased towards select restaurants in fact some of our own finds turned out to be much better than the hotels suggestions we discovered flour bakery for breakfastlunch and had an amazing dining experience at toro one night the hotels own restaurants and bars were very lively and quite good both in terms of the food quality and the bar scene
this hotels location was very central and ideal for walking around and discovering the city and it acted as an excellent base to start our day would absolutely stay here again for our next visit to boston",5.0
weeknight stay was great for the price cant vouch for the weekends,"i had really low expectations for the standard after reading the reviews posted on tripadvisor the reason we ended up booking our stay here was in order of importance 1 price 140 a night for a medium room 2 location we needed to be downtown and 3 we wanted to try something besides the westin bonaventure which was over 230 a night for the same days 
you should take everything i say with a grain of salt given that we stayed here from sunday through wednesday and therefore missed most of the alleged weekend pretentiousnessnoise and attitude we had no problem checking in or with any of the other amenities by amenities i mean that we ate dinner and breakfast at the restaurant downstairs food was good service was fine went up to the rooftop bar on tuesday night no wait because you get a wristband for staying at the hotel used the gym small and depressing and used the valet parking at the hotel every day each of these services were provided in a timely and appropriately polite manner 
my biggest complaint is that on sunday the day of our arrival the floor that we stayed on was littered with plates and cups from room service earlier in the day and the plates and cups were not removed until around 11 pm that night even though a number of hotel staff maids included passed the littered areas plates and cups may not sound that gross but there were half eaten omelettes oatmeal and fruit left on the floor to attract god knows what kinds of pestilence if this small incident is any indication of how service on the weekends is i probably would not stay at the standard however our stay for the rest of the weeknights went without incident and in fact we made bets about how long it would take before the room service plates on monday morning would be removed we left our room at 830 am and they were removed by the time we returned at 11 am  an overall improvement from our experience the previous day 
the rooms are decorated and reminiscent of college dorms the furniture is plastic and the bed is on a platform on the floor we both agreed that despite the underwhelming decor the rooms were very clean
our parting words are as follows if you need a place to stay in downtown la during the weeknights and can get a good price stay at the standard otherwise you might want to go elsewhere",3.0
lovely hotel but,"my family and i stayed a long fall weekend at the ritzcarlton boston and overall very much enjoyed our stay as previously noted in reviews the hotel is more modern than many other ritzcarltons but we still found it welcoming we had an executive suite which had enough room for our family of 5 with a rollaway 3 children under the age of 9 the room was nicely decorated and the king bed in the bedroom was very comfortable i was not impressed with the quality of the sofa bed but at least they gave us a featherbed topper to put on top of it the bathrooms were outstanding in particular the full bath in the bedroom and i really liked having a coat closet in the front foyer the location of the hotel is convenient to most attractions but its in a rather random few blocks on the edge of chinatown and in the middle of a couple of schools so there are a lot of students and bars there are not a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity 2 block radius  however that is not a huge consideration for most people
on the slight downside the staff was helpful but not overly so  ive had more helpful staff at other similar hotels but that alone would not dissuade me from the ritzcarlton boston for me the biggest downside which was still rather minor is that they really didnt make any accommodations for the kids frequently at similar hotels there will be a small treat waiting for the kids in the room coloring book or similar or the housekeepers will do something sweet with their beds a treat or tucking in their doll etc  but really they were pretty much overlooked during our stay i did note in the book in our room that they offered amenities for the kids  bathrobes etc  but there were none in our room and it wasnt worth it for me to call housekeeping note this was a minor detail on a very nice stay  it was not that the kids were unwelcome and everyone was very kind to them
overall we had a great trip and a lovely stay at the ritzcarlton boston would we stay there again perhaps  but id probably look around for other options in particular if the kids were with us for me it felt best suited to a business traveler but comfortable nevertheless",4.0
very good choice,my friend and i decided to have a girls weekend in the big apple the hotel was conveniently located just minutes from the empire state building great location easy access to the train staff was very nice and helpful the room was very clean with philosophy toiletries would highly recommend,4.0
had the best expirence,what can i say about this luxury hotel it really was a holiday that we will never forget the staff was amazing any thing needed from room service to concierge graham  was our guy and he directed us to some top places to eat from xmas day in a very good steak house benjamins good menu and great wine we had another fantastic meal at the bull and bear which is underneath the hotel and the service was second to nonei have read some reviews saying that its a little run down i just think for a hotel as old as it is its in great shape it is old but i think it adds to character truly a brilliant stay ,5.0
great experience at the w in bostonma,"it was our first time but will not be our last everyone at the hotel was very friendly and could not do enough to make sure we had a good time we had a hard time with working the lights in the room but that was taken care of once we listened to the phone message the rooms were good size and the beds were very comfy i love the extra wording around the hotel and in the rooms i will let you find them yourself the location was good and there were always taxis right outside we used valet and they were quick considering the location on the street
we are going back to try out the spait look great",5.0
four nights at the shoreham,"this was my 6th time to new york city and we were there with another couple who had never been before the shoreham is a very modern and trendy hotel with beautiful decor and a comfortable bed the location is terrific just blocks from 4 subway stops and an easy walk to various hot spots
the free coffee bar and new york times is a great touch and we hear that they offer a free fitness centerwe wouldnt really know about that
i stay at a different hotel everytime i go to nyc and while i have a lot of good things to say about this hotel i must add that it was my least favorite of all of my experiences 
i am of the theory that a traveller spends very little time in their hotel room in new york city so size isnt an issue however the size of these rooms are to the point of inconvenienve and discomfort you are bound to get a smaller room when you book a boutique hotel but the rooms at the shoreham are so so small you really have to maneuver just to get around the side of the bed and if you have more than one large bag there are very few options
the bar is beautiful but very high priced there is a great pub just about 6 doors east on 55th
so far the best hotel i have stayed at is the hyatt grand central and if you want a boutique style hotel check out the benjamin
if you are alone and want a trendy room in a good location book the shoreham the people are friendly and the place is very nice if your party is larger than one then look elsewhere",2.0
not up to usual hampton inn standards,i stay at many hilton properties and hamptons in particular i have been here a couple of times now but i wont be anymore my company has many people that have stayed here and they all report that the wifi is basically unusable and that has been my experience also i asked at the front desk and they admitted they get a lot of complaints but that there is nothing that they can do about it on top of this problem i went to work out in the gym but the elliptical machine was completely out of service with a broken wheel and the mini tvs that are part of each machine were all inoperative front desk stated that the repair service was on the way well two days later still nothing fixed given the number of other hotel choices in burleson one would think the local management would try a little harder,2.0
we loved it and we will definitely be back,my name is ginette ventura my husband and our 11yr stayed at this hotel for 1 night we checked in on fathers day and stayed until mon 20th we were in town for a school interview with our son we arrived at the hotel early before the check in time the staff was so wonderful and accommodating that they checked us in and held our bags we were so appreciative courtney at the front desk was absolutely wonderful and just a lovely person we told her why we were there and she was so excited for our son she told hime not to be nervous that he would do great we then asked her if there was a way to have our bags held while we were at the interview and she told us not to worry about anything that they would take care of everything this was our sons first trip to new york and you made it such a wonderful trip our stay was a bit short but tylerson loves ny so we will be back before he goes back to school please thank the staff at this location its nice to know that great customer service does exists thank you ,5.0
excellent location a bit of an old style hotel,excellent location a bit of an older hotel and it shows in the rooms though completely acceptable and clean had a room facing north and between the hotel and the next building there must have been below large trash containers as you could hear from 45 am garbage trucks in an out taking the trash out  which woke me up even on the 11th floor besides that a nice hotel seems like priority club members get a free complimentary starbucks voucher of 5 that can be used in the starbucks of the hotel which is a nice touch would stay again,3.0
rooms with views to mask the problems,this hotel has a lot of potential cosmetically it looked pretty good bathrooms were great but the rooms could use a better upgrade when we checked in we asked for a king with a sofa bed was told they were completely sold out she even checked with the manager and she said the same thing we are platinum members so we are supposed to be abe to get upgraded rooms if available we were fine with her answer so we got our key and went to our room after a few hours the ac unit in our room started making a horribly loud noise we couldnt hear anything over it maintenance couldnt fix it so they moved us to a different room surprisingly it was a king room with a sofa bed pretty sure thats what i asked for in the first place but whatever it was a corner room with views of the river and it was literally the most amazing view that view was almost worth the troubles except at 200 am this ac unit started making the very same noise really so irritating there was no way we were dragging all of luggage to a different room in the middle of the night i turned the ac completely off and tried to sleep not the best when its been 100 degrees outside all day i called the manager the next morning and he refunded the points we used for the room i feel he couldve done more than that but at that point we just wanted out of the hotel when we were leaving our room i heard over the maintenance radio that someone else was also having problems with a noisy ac unit im thinking its time to replace the ac units,3.0

1st time in boston,picked this hotel based on reviews here and price for other 4 star hotels in boston and we were very impressed the hotel looks every bit as good as it does in its website photos we arrived by train from nyc taxi to the hotelunder 10 and were shown to a great room on a corner not a great view but it is in the city centre surrounded by other buildings the staff were very polite and helpful and nothing was to much trouble tips ate once in the hotel bar and the meal was fine but you will pay hotel prices but you know that dont you did a waking tour which was excellent and would also recommend the duck tour the hotel couldnt be better placed for getting around with most things within an easy walk would recommend the bean town pub and the union oyster house quincey market and the sea front are also buzzing with life overall we loved boston and if and when we return would go back to the parker house,5.0
wow reviews didnt even begin to describe,the corner studio suite is truly an amazing experience we had adjoining rooms due to having 4 boys and although we the parents planned on sleeping in the nicer corner room the boys decided to camp out on the long corner benchesthey wanted to look out the windows walking the grounds was a delight and the meal  beyond dreamsthe adult hot chocolate made at our table with the donuts was so incredible highly recommend,5.0
good for price,"my rating is based mostly on value i got a large very acceptable room for 79much cheaper than the nearby hotel of the conference i was attending i found the service to be efficient and the hotel has history and character 
on the downside my room had windows facing other rooms and was a bit dark it also felt a bit worn you can ask for a room with a view if that is important to you 
it is also a bit of a walk to the metro 
good if you want a relatively lowcost option in the city",4.0
what a pleasant surprise,came to baltimore for a conference and found our hotel choice to have been spot on nothing but top notch customer service from the time we pulled up out front every staff member that we have interacted with has made it a point to go the extra mile special thanks to jason brown who took time to offer us a number of entertainment and dining options for our evening out a great time was had by all thank you jason well be delighted to return to this hotel,5.0
beautiful and wish i spent more time here,"the rooms are not the best part of the hotel the public areas are the style quotient of the hotel was superb details were taken care of even down to the wifi password the rooms are small but above average by new york standards i liked the attention to detail in the rooms

very nice right in the heart of downtown,"stayed here for two nights this april in town on business and the institution i was visiting arranged and paid for the room at check in they did not have an authorization form to have them pay and needed my cc number no problem they emailed my contact who had booked the room he sent a consent to charge and all was good staff was professional and courteous through all of this but it is a pricey hotel as is understandable in downtown
valet parking 31 a day kind of steep but guys working it was fast efficient and friendly offerred advice directions really top notch room was a king size on 4th floor bed was nice sheet good but i like a harder bed and it was the soft pillowy top wife would have loved it tv plenty of channels great deep soaking tub top notch restaurant in the lobby italian i however only had room service breakfast last morning hand cut oats with honey and fresh berries and a fresh squeezed oj all was very very tasty

worth a shot,"i stayed at the onyx june 1st for a business meeting the next day in the downtown area the hotel is tucked away on a smaller one way street the surrounding area was probably one of the only disappoints with this hotel the area wasnt lively at night at all and had few choices other than the hotel for dining not an ideal to take a casual stroll either i found 
what the location lacked the staff made up for small touches put a smile on my face such as a preshipped ups package already placed in my hotel room before checkin top that off with a handwritten personalized greeting note placed on the rooms desk was really a prime example of the touches youll find from a boutique hotel versus a megachain hotelier the room was small but average to what youd find in a nyc hotel ultra modern room with touches in white black gray and red rounded out the room",3.0
absolutely fabulous,"this was our first trip to san francisco and unsure where to stay the hotel was very nice for the money 99 per night had excellent views and was clean and quiet fishermans wharf offered a safe place with much to do in the evening nearby were many dining options in all price ranges transportation to pretty much anywhere you would want to go was within a few blocks most could be reached within one block the hotel staff and conceirge were very helpful dont miss alcatraz or johnny rockets both were great fun

lovely hotel but shame on the afternoon tea effort,"my wife and i stayed in the palmer house hotel for 4 nights in early august 2012 the hotel was very nice and the staff were very accommodating when we asked for a quite room we got one on the nineteenth floor away from the noise of the train going by
we were in chicago a few times in the past and we like that city very much this time we decided to do something special and invite my 2 sisters and their husbands for afternoon tea in the palmer hotel they live 40 miles outside the city
my wife booked the reservation for six people at lockwoods by phone from ireland just to ensure everything was ok we then looked forward to a very special little event which we thought our us folks would appreciate a lot as we have similar in the shelbourne hotel dublin and the standard is of the highest
we checked at the desk at 2 oclock and were asked to take a seat we did not realise that the table wasnt even ready finally at 215 we were shown to a small oval coffee table not big enough to hold the cups and saucers when the teapots arrived we had to move side plates to make space milk arrived 30 minutes later which we had to ask for i spoke to the person at lockwoods she quickly vanished and was not seen again when sandwiches arrived the waitress wondered where she would put them so my wife had to hold them while she got a small table to put beside her so she could dish them out at this stage we were highly embarrassed and hurt the bill arrived with an 18 cover charge i did not think it was the fault of the waitress but the supervisor who was informed from the beginning
we complained to the duty manager of the hotel who was shocked and got the manager of the restaurant to ring us he offered a bottle of wine which my wife declined he gave us 20 off which did not mean anything as the afternoon was totally destroyed",4.0
wonderful experience,our stay at embassy suites was short we arrived late and had to leave before 10am check in was very quick and the staff was very accommodating our room was on the 8th floor elevator was a little slow but not too bad the room was clean and the bed was really comfortable one of the best features in the room was the fact that there were electrical outlets everywhere on every lamp on every table i could plug in the computer phone charger everything breakfast the next morning was amazing cooked to order by 2 very nice chefs who encouraged people to eat offered to make special items for kids etc i couldnt have asked for anything more at this hotel except maybe the opportunity to stay longer,5.0

great great hotel,"searching for a hotel in ny look no further you have found it
we have just arrived from a 3 day stay in ny although it was not our first trip to ny i searched for a hotel at the trip advisor and believe me this hotel worth is position there
it is more expensive then others you can find but if you can afford it you wont regret it
the sofitel is very well located just two blocks from times square the rooms are large specially for ny great bed great bathroom well soundproofed modern furniture
the staff were all very efficient polite the check in and check out without any problem
the food at the restaurant was great and come out quickly
in summary a case where what you found is even better then what is showed in the pictures

dont stay on floor 25 of the historic tower,hotel location is great bed was wonderful nice bathroom towels are a little smallbut i cant help but wondering if they put us on the 25th floor  where the elevator mechanism is for the entire historic tower  because we perhaps paid a lower rate we were trying to nap after an extremely early morning flight and i kept hearing a consistent thud which woke me from my nap i thought i was crazy and went out to the elevator lobby i complained to the desk clerk who said they have never had complaints about that room or floor hard to believethen they sent security to see what the issue might be and he opened the door in the elevator lobby to a huge room that contained an ancient looking elevator machine they moved us but were not too apologetic about the incovenience,4.0

not the best start to a stay,i stayed here for six nights on a trip that included both business and pleasure purposes i booked through a conventions site and my room was paid for in advance there were some issues upon checkin about what was included with my reservation and it was handled poorly i was assured that everything was in order but later the night i checked in a very curt voice mail was left by the checkin staffer who was also a member of the hotel management saying the issue was my problem and that i should take it up with the convention folks i had a printout of my confirmed reservation that showed the addon in question but i did not get what i paid for it would have been so easy for the dt to fix the problem at checkout a different hotel manager admitted the hotels mistake although no one bothered to correct it during the six days i was there they did take off parking fees to make up for the misunderstanding  that was a good thing other problems with the property ridiculously slow internet service and theres a 12 per day charge for it but i was told at checkout that they are hoping to have this upgraded by the end of august 2011 i had to change rooms the first night as the room i was initially given abutted the elevator shaft and every time someone pushed the call button i could hear the elevator going up and down the second room was very quiet 1012 i found hairs on most of the towels i pulled off the shelf  not mine wrong color heres the good turndown service with the always popular dt cookies is terrific the trolley stops right across the street and there are plenty of restaurants and other businesses close by  great location if you dont need to be downtown or by the beach a cab ride downtown without traffic will run you 20 with tip i had room service twice and both times the food was excellent other than the aforementioned checkin staff member the rest of the staff was polite and helpful the room itself was fine bottom line its a value thing  for 200 per night i expect a bit better service,3.0

great hotel great location,loved this hotel it was in a great location opposite the waldorf astoria and the intercontinental next to the subway and only a ten minute walk to times square should you feel the urge to go there great rooms very comfortable beds small kitchen area with fridge and microwave the bathroom was small just about the tiniest sink in the world but very well appointed and nice amenities the aircon took a bit to work out but overall it was a really nice hotel room the new restaurant and bar the national was fantastic  really great atmosphere for evening drinks and great food with very good service  could not fault it,4.0

great for the lake and trail,"stayed here for just under a week in october 2008
very pleasant hotel best to stay in the new lake block at the back rather than in the circular block at the front
had absolutely fantastic views of the lake and surrounds
very quiet room given the closeness to the highway
room service was excellent every day and they deserved a good tip when we checked out
there is free parking in the multistorey car park which takes up the first 45 floors of the rear block
there is a small gym two treadmills and a recumbant bike and maybe one other piece of equipment there is a nice rooftop pool its fine for a quick swim can sunbathe around the pool no problems at all
meals were pleasant at the hotel had breakfast a couple of times it was 10 each for as much as you like they will cook an omelette to order given i like to eat lunch and dinner and the huge portions you get everywhere i didnt eat breakfast every day restaurant is quiet in the evenings but food and service were fine had 2 evening meals at the hotel on nights that we couldnt face travelling anywhere else
the hotel is a 1520 minute walk away from the downtown austin nightlife along somewhat lonely streets but not a great problem if you can drive get a cab or just dont mind a quick walk 
dont get me wrong this hotel is central and right on the lake just its on the eastern border of central austin and theres not too much right on the doorstep
next door but not obtrusive at all there is a gas station that doubles up as a minimart with snacks drinks fruit etc which is handy if you need something if you are on the way out for a walk or drive
i would certainly come back again to this hotel unless i was in austin just for the nightlife when i would choose a hotel more central",4.0
cant beat the location,"location location location  need i say more this hotel is in the centre of the cbd close to the trolley cars buses and bart station as a family of five travelling from australia we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the handlery we had a corner family suite in the front older part of the hotel which had plenty of room for us and all of our luggage the smaller room held a double or queen bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed with the sofa away we had a large lounge area with coffee table  perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of san franciso
this kids also enjoyed the pool  which was outdoors but heated nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food including a walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies there was a fridge in the kids room the irish pub next door has a fantastic dinner buffet and the bar around the corner has a champagne happy hour and live music for mum  dads time out
my tip for familys is to use the bart to travel back to the airport we easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us yes 7 to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean bart train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus more money to spend in the wonderful shops in chinatown",5.0
great location,stayed here en route from toronto to washington on an escorted tour very comfortable hotel  a bit large for my liking though however i would recommend it as it is so central had our breakfast here which was a bit pricey but you would expect that from a large hotel in central boston rom was a bit smaller than other hotels we stayed in but then that is what happens when it is such an old building i would recommend this hotel for its central location and comfort within easy walking of the main shops and the park,4.0
the perfect getaway,"how in the world is it that on a particular day motel 6 in san diego cost just as much as kona kai for the same night well thats exactly what happened and we ended up stay at this hidden little paradise instead of winging it and spending the night at a motel quite honestly probably the best decision we made the check in process at kona kai was quick we were charged a decent amount for parking and the rest was beautiful beautiful experience
okay so ive had my fair share of outdated and silly decor and rooms kona kai just barely dodged that bullet their decor i would have to describe as quaint and cute honestly the carpet and whatever else may have been outdated really didnt matter we open up the two doors and it opened right up to the beach the most gorgeous views and kona kai played it right i loved how humble the room came off as while boasting such a beautiful property there was a big sparkling pool next to a great little hot jacuzzi
my boyfriend and i walked around the property checking out the sea life in the dock stalking seagulls swinging on the childrens playground swing set next to the dock we walked across the street walked next to the beautiful beach and watched the sun set 
their room service was beyond amazing they have these pork nachos that were everything my boyfriend and i ever dreamt of in a nacho i still drool at the thought of them ive yet to encounter such perfection anywhere else",5.0
easily a great choice,visiting philadelphia on leisure for two days and two nights my wife and i elected to stay at the sofitel based on the positive reviews on this and other websites we were not disappointed paying only a little above 200 per night we got a very spacious suite  a corner one at that  and the experience was impressive in every aspect the service was friendly professional and efficient the valet parking which cost us a mere 30 total meant that our car was ready at the door when we wanted it and upon arriving back at the hotel we could just get out of the car and go back to our room very convenient the decoration and styling of the hotel is not as gaudy and florid as some other highend brands but the look is very elegant modern and artistic no less you might call it luxury without ostentation the suite was most accomodating in every way from the numerous spacious closets to the heavenly comofortable bed to the wellstocked refrigerator bar and the wall finishings and all the furniture oh and the bathroom  extremely impressive it was tremendous with two sinks a comfortable bath and a spacious shower if i had to find anything to quibble about i could say that the wireless internet should have been free rather than 10day though i was able to get a free signal from a nearby hotel and it would be nice if the bathroom would have a jacuzzi rather than a plain bathtub though strictly speaking it was actually a jacuzzi brand bathtub but anyway cant speak for the barrestaurant as we did not partake dont forget to bring cash to tip the valets room service and bellhops all in all you cant go wrong with this hotel certainly at the price we paid strongly recommended we would easily stay there again,5.0
completely ridiculous,"stayed in a serenity suite this time around at a lower price due to a poor experience previously at the dana i wanted to give them one last shot before i wrote them off completely 
can i just say putting someone in a handicap accessible suite when the guests are so obviously not handicapped is ridiculous secondly the pictures are 800 doctored on their website to look more glorious than the rooms actually look the website shows stone seating in the shower area our bathroom did not include this luxury the website also shows a privacy curtain up on the window dividing bedroom and living area the room did not have this curtain 
what our room did have was a lot of broken lighting fixtures painters tape everywhere yes were talking bright blue tape on various walls throughout the room also included at no cost was the abandoned lunch cooler on our balcony outside this room would normally cost upward of 500 a night do you not at least do a run thru before putting guests in the room professional this place is not 
when we called down to the front desk to discuss the issues we were greeted with blatant rudeness well i see you had a problem with your stay last time what is it this time if you would like we can downgrade you into a normal room
my friend and i have never been talked to so condescendingly 
surely we will not be coming back ever im sure the trump would provide a higher level of service without the obvious snobbery and carelessness 
on a positive note there is a complimentary breakfast downstairs on the main floor and it was a pretty nice spread delicious granola fruit bagels etc 
but i didnt pay hundreds of dollars for bagels did i",2.0
as expected at this price,the hotel was as advertised the shared bathrooms were generally clean depending on the previous user there are four bathrooms on my floor but only two of them had sinks in response to another reviewer i didnt have a lot of towels in fact i had a face cloth hand towel and a body towel that is large only by european standards it wasnt large by american standards on my first night i inquired about how to control the heat in my room because it was too hot in fact the heat cannot be controlled on a per room basis instead the heat is centrally controlled and is on a fixed schedule the radiator in my room turned off at 1130pm and turned on at about 630am in between i used the air conditioner to cool the room on the brighter side the heat allowed me to do laundry and everything dried easily the staff was nice and polite noise from the bathrooms are noticeable wifi wasnt very reliable i relied on my cell phone service instead,3.0

pardon our dust dont bother until its finished,we paid 189 plus taxes for a room that looked like it hadnt been decorated in fifteen years on a corridor in the process of being refurbished although nobody appeared to be working on the refurbishment during our stay the ice and vending facilities were out of use while the floors were being retiled the signs said very helpfully pardon our dust im sure itll be nice when the refurbishment is finished and the staff were up to usual doubletree standards to be honest though id steer clear unless the hotel can guarantee you a room in a part of the building where the work has already been completed the parking spaces are tiny by the way so be prepared to breathe in if youre getting in or out of a normal or larger sized car,1.0
really different,i spent one night here and a friend i was travelling with stayed for a week the staff were friendly and really helpful they made the trip for us the rooms were really nice and comfy and spotless breakfast was ok bagles and muffins nothing fancy teh mini cinema with the free popcorn was a definte plus as was the area 5 minutes from union square f line bart and cable cars i would definitely go back when im next in the city,5.0
fabulous 40 at the mark,"just returned from a special 40th birthday treat to new york and stayed at the mark hotel a great quiet location in new york but really close to central park on arrival we were informed of breakfast being included in our room rate   our room was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious the staff were quite friendly and chatted and being a smaller hotel had that more personal feel as we had a late evening flight the hotel let us use a room in the afternoon to freshen up and change before we left for the airport
the only downside was the extortionate price for room service which we got on our first night as we arrived quite late
would certainly return if i went to new york again",5.0
great hotel in a great location,this is a very nice hotel geared toward the business traveler but quite accommodating to families we had a great room and wonderful service the room was in the west tower requested thanks to suggestions of other reviewers which has been renovated and is quite nice the location of the hotel is fantastic our room overlooked lake michigan and was great due to the location of the other high rise buildings we were disappointed that despite our great view of navy pier we were not able to see the fireworks from our room oh well we had a great stay and will return to this hotel,5.0
best of breed,"this residence inn beats out every other hotel of its category and even hotels with more stars that ive ever stayed in 20 years of worldwide travel in 5star to nostar hotels i intend to return here any time i come to memphis 
to begin with it has great service from jesse the professional competent friendly guy at the reception desk to tracy the sales manager doug carl and a few others whose names i didnt catch all of the staff were on the ball and obviously cared about providing good service in a real way not a plastic smile way the hotel has the charm of an old building with a lovely view of the river lovely big room suites with clean bathrooms comforatable beds and wellappointed kitchens all the important amenities small workout room and complimentary passes to nearby health club rooftop hot tub free wifi free local calls ironing boards and blow dryers laundry service etc and a nice location near a variety of good restaurants 
it provides a complimentary varied breakfast and a pleasant reception every evening the evening reception has complimentary light fare beer wine coffee tea and soft drinks and on thursday evenings becomes a rooftop barbeque with homecooked picnicstyle food eg grilled veggies sausages bbq chicken potato salad coleslaw chips watermelon

a new standard for hotels,"alexis has created a loyalty for me to kimpton hotels this boutique hotel demonstrates what other hotels lack down the small details its modern chic and luxurious my stay at alexis was not only pleasant but felt as a retreat as well will definitely be back and will definitely be visiting other kimpton hotels from now on
alexis is conveniently located near pike place and by elliot bay it was a very short walk to the pier 1 block where there were plenty of delicious foods to eat i even walked to the space needle which is the farthest attraction i wanted to see and on my way back i walked through downtown i only had to park my car once and never had to move it until i left for the airport because everything is in close proximity to the hotel
if you forget a few things like we all usually do alexis provides them complimentary while you stay at the hotel things like cell phone chargers curling irons bandaids etc this will definitely save you a trip from the convenience store and having multiples of these items when you get home
i will definitely be coming back and now im excited to visit other kimpton hotels",5.0

classyelegantthe eldon is a remarkable hidden dc gem,"we stayed here for memorial day weekend and loved it 
the eldon is a relatively new hotel that just opened in march of this year we took the subway in from dca this airport has a direct line to the hotel if you hop on the yellow to mt vernon squareconvention center exit 
from the outside the eldon has a historic facade which is very washingtonian the inside however is a totally different story in itself the hallways boast very luxurious marble floors and walls there is a unique set of glass artwork on every floor and the lobby has soothing spalike music to really help you relax the moment you walk in did i mention checking in was a snap the front desk staff were very friendly and more than willing to go over and above to help us with finding our way around helping us with our bags great personal service that youd only find at small hotels the concierge there vinh is exceptional he has first hand experience of the area being a dc native and recommended to us some local favorites like marrakesh 7course morrocan dinner with live belly dancer phillips all you can eat seafood right by the waterfront
the designers spared no expense in making you feel very pampered the trend of marble floors and artwork continue onward into the guest rooms themselves the furnishings have a very modern and contemporary flare the rooms are bright spacious and luxurious my girlfriend loved sleeping on the down pillowscomforter the hotel provides guests with bathroom amenities from loccitane a very high end french brand the showers themselves are state of the art with a massaging jet function a real treat at the end of the day of sight seeing
there is a complimentary continental breakfast served every morning in the lounge area across from the lobby with very lovely pastries the cherry filled danishes were my favorite there is also a fitness center on the rooftop with a breathtaking view of the city we didnt have time for it this trip but we were up there to look at the facilityviews 
i am not sure what else to add the eldon has everything you want while visiting dc complimentary wifi in the rooms great location to downtownnational mall metro accessible located on the same block to a cvs and 3 blocks from a safeway a friendly and personable staff that is willing to serve you and make you happy in room spa services the eldon made our first trip to dc a memorable one that we wont soon forget

great staynot so great room,the sheraton was a great hotelonly a couple blocks from camden yards and a few blocks from the inner harbor we booked thru hotwire and upon arriving to our room we found ourselves in a handicap room we didnt mind the low bed rails near the toilet or in the shower but we did have issue with the condition of the bathroom it seemed as though the room had been recently renovated but someone forgot to update the bathroom there was old dirty caulk in the corners rustry shower rails and a rickety rusting pole holding up one end the the sink the bed was hard as a rock weve stayed in sheratons in the past and loved their cushy beds and heavenly pillowsbut this bed was the equivalent to sleeping on a slab of sheetrock i wont give up on sheraton but i will not pay full price to stay at the sheraton inner harbor,3.0
what you would expect but too pricey,"great location  check great service  check great lounge  check clean rooms  check great big bill  double check 
my husband and i stayed the weekend of october 5th which was extremely busy due to the chicago marathon and a game at soldier field when we booked this hotel in august this was one one of the few rooms available in downtown chicago
the hotel is very large but very well run it was everything you would expect at a downtown hotel the staff was very professional and the rooms were fine i can say that it was probably one of the smallest bathrooms ive encountered in a us hotel  but it was not an issue
i was particularly happy when a staff member found my drivers license by the elevator on the 39th floor where we stayed it was the day we were checking out and they promptly called our room to say that they had the license at the front desk i can only imagine how my day would have gone showing up at the airport without my license
overall a good experience but nothing to write home about particularly when paying topdollar",3.0
dont waste your money,ill be honest i read the reviews that came before me and thought they were all just being overdramatic its a twostar in ny what do you expect so we went anyway we checked in on 21605 and were supposed to stay 7 nights we checked out the next day two stars are two too many for this dump most places in our price range were already booked for the weekend but we were lucky enough to find the super 8 in times sqare a onestar according to this website that was head and shoulders above the pennsylvania everything that has been said in the other reviews is accurate its not even worth it by budget hotel standards,1.0
daughters birthday,very nice despite still being under construction two issues first the walls are very thin and we heard a lot of ambient noise second there was only one mirror in the entire king suite with 4 of us including a teenage girl this was nearly catastrophic for us the fitness center could be an issue as well only 2 treadmills and 1 bike,4.0
great hotel,stayed a couple of nights while a family member was having surgery at one of the area hospitals it is very clean comfortable bedspillows the staff was very polite and the in house restaurant was really good we ate there twice they also offer free shuttles to area locations and all the hospitalsmedical centers which makes it really nice to have one less thing to worry about it is also close to plenty of restaurants and stores would definitely recommend to others and would stay here again if in the area,5.0
great with kids,i took my 9 year old niece for a weekend in san francisco and stayed at the hotel del sol she had a fantastic time they accomodated all her needs she got to check out videos books and games from their closet at the front desk her favorite part was the chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon we hung out on the hammock and at the pool i live nearby so i had chance to see my neighborhood as a visitor its a safe neighborhood with lots of amenties nearby and has a hotel with a good price we will stay here again,4.0
new york tradition,ive stayed at the roosevelt on my last two trips to new york i like the history and tradition of the roosevelt its where guy lombardo used to do his new years eve broadcast ted husing and lindsey nelson mentioned the roosevelt in the autobiographies its a hotel of the cafe society of the 20s and 30s the closest hotel to grand central station walking distance to the broadway theatres someone mentioned how relaxing the bar isi agree for new york its an affordable hotel thats also a famous hotel big hotel for a big city,5.0
i owe trip advisor for this one,"went to chicago for a conference  not my first vist  and sought some advice on the chicago travel forum on hotels that would help me mix a little buisness with pleasure i intended on getting my brother and sister to join me on the trip  but they never got their act together so i ended up traveling solo
i usually  because of just pure laziness and the prospect of accumulating points stay with marriott but i decided to take a leap of faith and try out this boutiquetype hotel that offered river views so very glad i did 
 first the view was excellent nice large windows to enjoy the view from the hotel is situated somewhat perpendicular to the river so from your river view room you look down the river as it opens out on the lake gives you such a unique feel to chicago especially at sunrise and sunset the way the light plays along the streets river makes it seem as if chicago has laid a golden carpet out you and only youand that the city is yours for the taking i think this is by far this hotels top selling point 
the service was excellent i booked my room through the hotels website because they had a special running at the time i got a deluxe room  with two queen beds and river view for 227 night during the last week in august the room was clean appeared freshly renovated more spacious than i expected i think the catch was that it was a physically impaired disabled accessible room but dont let that fool you you could hardly notice the modifications contemporary styling keeps the bars looking as if they are just part of the decor and i did not note this until i was checking out 
of course you cant beat the location took one train from midway to the statelake station  45min ride one way and had 5 min easy walk to the hotel another 510 min walk from the hotels steps and i was in a millineum park enjoying a sandwhich and perrier listening to jazz floating through the air from the free summer concert series ahh heaven 
loved this hotel so much that when i had to return to chicago 1 month later i tried to book it outright and didnt even bother searching for an internet dealbut they were full  the horror
no worries though investigated the closest hotel that offered the same location and thus the same views and found the river hotel next door with slightly cheaper rates however in comparison river hotel had much smaller rooms and they were missing the nice decor no friendly doorman had to wait in a line at the checkout counter sigh yes i had been spoiled by hotel 71 and i probably looked like a jealous lover as rolled my carryon luggage past that day with a huff but let that speak to hotel 71s quality and value not truly anything against river hotel
would return to hotel 71 in a heartbeat if hotel 71 would take me back ",5.0
had a great time,"we stayed for 4 nights july 1317 we had a great time we had a tower room with a view of the bay the opposite side of the pool it was great we watched the fire works from sea world on our balcony and did not have the hot afternoon sun 
we ate breakfasts at the red marlin and it was delicous i recommend the buffet what a great way to start the day the service was great
pool was good as was the slides for the kids 
there is a little fish place right down from the hotel we walked to which was excellent luckily we waited for a table outside as the inside leaves some to be desired so go early
we will go back",4.0
thumbs up for the metro hotel,"we are a family of five adult new zealanders who returned just a few days ago from our first visit to new york we spent a week at the metro hotel which we found difficult to fault the location was excellent allowing us to walk to many of the places we wanted to go as well being close to the subway for longer trips we all got a buzz seeing the empire state building from our windows and especially the roof terrace
our rooms were spacious and scrupulously clean our family all appreciated the breakfast and found it perfectly adequate it was so good being able to just get on with our day rather than have to search for a breakfast cafe
we found most of the hotel staff friendly and helpful with the exception of a couple of those manning the front desk however on the whole we were delighted with our choice of hotel and would thorougly reccomend it to all visitors to new york",5.0
comfortable and accommodating,the laurel inn is in a great location on the corner of california and presidio a pleasant area with good restaraunts they do offer a continental breakfast as well as lemonade and cookies in the afternoonthe staff was helpful upon check inout our room had two double beds with comfortable bedding and pillows we had a nice view of the city from our room parking is not freenot unusual but we had the comfort of knowing our vehicle was in a safe garage and could access it easily we would definently return to the laurel inn,4.0
good choice of hotel near the airport,"this review is written by a business traveler who frequents marriott and hilton hotels around the world primarily in the us and it is based on a onenight stay in may 2009
i wont rehash everything previous reviewers have described so here are the highlights for fellow frequent travelers
pros
 this property meeting or exceeding the fairfield inn standards
 wireless internet access is free and fast 54mbs speeds
 renovated bathroom flooring

 close proximity to the san jose airport without the airplane noise
opportunities for improvement

 no market available in the lobby for latenight snacks
for business travelers and other folks looking for value and convenience this property will meet ones needs in the san jose area",5.0
nice place to stay,just back from a 4 night stay on marathon weekend 6 blocks from magnificent mile lots of great restaurants surrounding it yolk wildfire uno due ginos east eggcitement greeted by micheal a stand out the staff was friendly helpful and offered fantastic options for our stay the room was great comfy beds clean well appointed the pool was good to cool our tired legs after running only negatives would be poor wifi small slow elevator fire station 4 blocks away  mediocre restaurant would stay there again in a second however,4.0
highly reccomend the affinia 50,"we stayed at the affinia 50 for one night in march 2006 the staff was very friendly and helpful the concierge was very knowledgeable and went out of her way to find out our preferences before making suggestions for dinner
the location is great a few blocks from rockefeller center and on a relatively quiet street
our only complaint was that the bathroom was a little small otherwise we had plenty of room in room internet access and even a kitchen in the room
after we got home we received a survey and after completing it were given a discount certificate for our next stay
we will definitely stay there on future trips to new york",5.0
definitely not your ordinary boutique hotel,"stayed here for 3 nights the main draw of this hotel is its proximity to lax this is my first time staying at custom hotel and absolutely fell in love with this place
servicecheck incheck out
checked in a little early with now hassle i wish the front desk receptionist was a little more pleasant and smiled more after a long flight you definitely want to see you pleasant face greet you upon your arrival be prepared for high hold fees on your card we booked our stay online and paid in advance and wasnt expecting a 50day holding fee other hotels usually dont charge that much holding fees for a prepaid stay valet parking is a little pricey too other hotels in the area charges 15over night stay wish there was an option for paid self park at their parking structure but it wasnt too bad to valet the valet attendants were really nice and gave good directions on getting around town and it doesnt hurt that theyre very easy on they eyes 
breakfast buffet isnt worth it at 11 there was very little options all they had was bacon eggs oatmeal potatoes and pancakes at their price point they should over a lot more options may more pasties just more choices
room
the room was very neat i myself admire the minimalist design aesthetic and this definitely suited my taste the rooms are a little on the small side but it doesnt really matter you get great views a cool mood light and a flat screen tv and of course free wifi we stayed on the 2nd floor and was awaken sunday morning by loud music cheering and singing a church event was going on next door to us in their conference room it wasnt a good way to wake up to such loud music wish their conference rooms were sound proof or they should address the sound due to the proximity of the rooms to the conference hall
pooloutdoordeck 33
spent sometime out here and find it just divine its a great spot to kick back grab a drink and just unwind after a long day of touring the city wish they hosted parties or some sort of activities during the weekend to make it much more lively maybe they do during summer
location
perfect location located on a less busy street and definitely avoids all the traffic in the seemingly congested century blvd with all the other lax area hotels its also close to stores and restaurants at this condo building next door 
overall
had a great stay at custom hotel and would definitely return and recommend this place to friends and family visiting la theyre not just an ordinary hotel but they have raised the standard of hotels around lax definitely can compete with the big name chain hotels",4.0
cockroach encounter,"i stayed in w san francisco for three nights from january 29 to february 1 2009 in the past i stayed in w los angeles on hilgard avenue and it was superb so i decided to stay in w when i was on my business trip to san francisco together with my two friends from canada
i prepaid my room through travelocity ang got the rate of approximately 250 canadian 200 us per night
i have seen a lot of hotels in my life but this stay was the most horrible one account for the amount i paid for the room first of all the hotel lobby is converted to a bar which attracts so called fashionable san francisco individuals in reality the bar is full of punks enjoying themselves listening to the ugliest and loudest music i have ever heard you can be sure that you will have a chance to listen to those musical masterpices from your room
in the evening of the second day i encounterd a live cockroach in my room this fellow came out of the gap between the wall shelf and television and rapidly proceeded to the work desk in the direction of the window what an opportunity to have such a wonderful neighbour for only 250 a night it took me five minutes to chase and execute my guest
next morning i reported this incident to the front desk and it seemed to me that their receptionist was not surprised at all i suspect that the whole building is infested because cockroaches usually do not come alone the receptionist assured me that the hotel would perform disinfection of my room and issue an official apology certainly no special cleaning was done apart from regular room service and i am still waiting for that promised apology
after we had checked out one of my friends discovered a charge of 75 applied to his account for drinks in the lobby bar he has never visited since it happened last week he still keeps calling the w trying to get his 75 back
the other friend of mine who also prepaid his room discovered a charge equalt to 8 cents eight cents on his account when checking out according to the hotel they made a mistake when giving a quote for his stay so the actual rate was eight cents more than the one my firend has prepaid this eightt cents charge was applied to his credit card
i can continue sharing my experience relating to this w hotel but i assume that what i have already mentioned herein is enough for a prospective visitor to san francisco to make his decision about this hotel",1.0
good value and convenient location,i have stayed at this hotel 46 times per year for the past several years it under went a remodel about four years ago and is holding up well more recently the breakfast area was opened up to provide more room its a practical change that works but do miss the old gas fireplace myriad dining choices nearby and with the opening of the domain shopping area this hotel is convenient to some of the newest hippest shopping austin has to offer the staff is courteous friendly and helpful while rarely an issue it has been my experience this hotel takes seriously quest comfort and will enforce its noise policy the business center has one computer and printer overall in my opinion a good value and convenient location,4.0
if you come with low expectations youll enjoy your stay,i stayed for five nights from january 10th15th and would recommend the hotel for wellprepared budgetconscious travellers having read several rants before booking my room i was fortunate enough to arrive on a late flight from europe avoiding the 4 pm checkin ordeal it also helped that the airline lost my luggage so i came even later than planned i had earplugs so managed to slumber through the latenight revelry and cleaning lady cacophony i requested a quiet room low down  stairs instead of lift queues i had a shower in my room instead of a bath no peering in revulsion at hair clogging the plug the room was freezing the last day but i burrowed down beneath my cosy bedding and survived the few occasions i approached the front desk the staff were just like any other new yorkers friendly and direct i had breakfast across the road every morning you save quite a few bucks staying here and i didnt have any complaints having come expecting the worst the localisation is perfect for concerts at carnagie hall or the lincoln center if you dont mind walking 10 blocks then maybe the hilton at times square would be an alternative naturally the ymca is only 25 dollars a night,3.0
bad deal all around stay somewhere else,this is a glorified sideroad motel with dirty looking outdated rooms with an awkward location kids enjoyed the pool but but you have to drive for everything else and the parking is a ridiculous 18  night this hotel  motel  warrants about 1 star we will not go back,2.0
they just dont care,the room was ok but the front desk staff were rude use this place as a last resort at least there are no bugs,1.0
nice place at a good price,a very nice property with a very accomodating staff beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was good we had purchased the summer special that included breakfast we arrived rather late and the staff directed us next door to a hilton where the bar was still open for food service,4.0
absolutely beautiful hotel,we live in michigan and have made many trips to chicago with our son he was 7 at the time of this trip and the affinia was the best hotel weve ever stayed in we stayed in a queen suite with a fold out couch the room was beautiful and the whole hotel was immaculate i cant comment on service since we didnt order any but the location was great it was within walking distance of the pier and many other chicago attractions there was also an awesome pizza place right next door its more of a businesstype hotel so i wouldnt recommend it to people who want to have entertainment at the hotel for their kids,5.0
nice hotel but a little out of the way,"we chose the savoy suites in georgetown mainly because of the free parking we parked our car at the beginning of the trip a long weekendthursday to monday and didnt use it until we left with that said the hotel is a little out of the way yes there is a shuttle that takes you to the closest metro this is very convenient we only had to wait about 2 minutes at the longest on the other hand we werent really sure how the pickup at the metro to get back to the hotel worked and we were usually coming in very late the shuttle only runs until 10pm so we ended up taking cabs back to the hotel those ran about 8 the hotel is also not that close to georgetown we walked down to m street and it took us the better part of half an hour plus on the way back to the hotel its all uphill
location aside the hotel is super clean and everyone that works there is so friendly our beds were comfortable and the complimentary shower products were very nice we ate a late lunch in the hotels restaurant and our cobb salads were delicious the bar tender francisco was lovely 
if we return to dc we may look at hotels that are closer to where the action is ie we spent all of our time by the mall and at nats stadium but for the price you cant beat it and you get free parking 
we had an very enjoyable stayif only we could pick up the hotel and move it a little closer
oh if you do stay here and take the shuttle to the metro there is a fantastic restaurant on the corner called open city we had breakfast here twice and it was amazing",4.0
perfect locationgreat hotel,upon my 3rd visit to nyc i stayed at the edison and im so so glad that i did what a great hotel perfectly situated off time square so your only a stones throw away from the hustle ans bussle of the nyc lifestyle the room was greatcomfy and very clean the staff were really nice and very polite and really helpful when we needed to hail a taxi down to go out for dinner all in all a cracking hotel and i will be staying there again next month cant wait,5.0
really affordable luxury the gem of boston,the property is located across from boston common in a trendy part of the city the lobby and reception are sumptuous and very high class the hotel rooms are a bit dated but well maintained and appointed and have everything you needsort of a classic feel but with all the luxery of a super high end hotel the best part the price boston is notorious for extremely high priced accomodations and this is the exception almost too good to be true i used to pay upwards of 250 for hi express downtown which is what you would expect but this property does it all including a plethora of restaurant options for 120 full time concierge gift shop business and fitness centers no pool but who has time in boston a true value and pleasant professional crew to assist your every needs highly recomended,4.0
wingatejacksonville,wingate hotels are usually decent to stay in however we changed rooms five times before finally accepting one without a stale odor this was our worst experience in recent years,2.0
great staff great breakfast great value,"the woman taking our madetoorder breakfast orders had an amazing memory and my eggs were perfect every time 
i like that they served cooked oatmeal rather than packets of instantoats which so many other hotels have with their free breakfast the fruit was fresh and sweet 
we were there on business and never tried the pool or fitness center it seems like a place where you could stay easily with kids 
our beds were comfy i like the furniture 
they provided shampoo conditioner and soap in our room we asked the friendly competent front desk staff and were immediately given shower cap body lotion etc i guess they arent putting one of everything in the rooms now to prevent waste my partner comment on how well trained staff wasseveral times",5.0
good value for the budgetminded traveler,"last time i was in san francisco i saw the astoria and thought it looked like a decentenough hotel when i was called to the city on sudden business i checked the astorias rates and found them to be astonishingly low for the hotels location i also checked trip advisor and saw mixed reviews based on what i read i wasnt sure what to expect but i decided to go ahead and stay at the astoria  i needed a cheap place to stay
maybe its because i didnt hold high hopes for the astoria but my stay there was a pleasant one the hotel reminds me very much of places ive stayed in london  small lift narrow staircases
my room which had an attached bath i understand that some rooms do not have an ensuite another similarity to small london hotels was rather spartan there is a television but no clock radio but very clean the very large window looked onto a small patio and could be opened widely for lots of fresh air my room was very quiet too while i could hear people pass in the hallway now and then i did not hear guests talking in their rooms or watching television it was peaceful
the bathroom was immaculate in fact i am hardpressed to remember a cleaner hotel bathroom in my more recent travels in terms of amenities you will want to bring your own hair dryer but the hotel does provide a shower cap soap and shampoo  very basic toiletries on par with what you might find at a red roof inn
the hotels location is fantastic the montgomery bart station is two blocks away union square and shopping heaven are two blocks down and one over chinatown is literally right outside the door for people who want a bit more than the astorias continental breakfast there is a starbucks right across the street another one a block down and several pubs and cafes in between
overall my experience at the astoria was great its clean and functional and while it might not be the ideal setting for a romantic weekend getaway or a luxurious vacation its perfect for people who just need a convenient clean economical wellsituated place to crash i will definitely be staying there again",4.0
what you would expect from kimpton,"i am not a boutique hotel guy give me a relatively generic but comfortable chain hotel and im fine quirky decorations and a stylish lobby are great but since im not living there i can live without them if youre like me then this hotel really hovers somewhere between 3 and 4 circles if you are in to the boutique thing then this is a 4circle hotel for sure
first the good news the rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff is friendly and efficient overall but like a lot of boutique hotels you get a pretty small space to work in this room inspired the punchchline when i put the key in the front door i broke the back window they have a desk but the tv is mounted right above it so while i like working with the tv on i dont get into the front row movie theater experience and so couldnt do without resorting to sitting on the bed and the bathroom is classic nyc hotel if you are over 6 tall i am not you could possibly hit your knee on the wall when you sit on the toilet unless you ride side saddle can that be done safely
the breakfast buffet is definitely up to par except in rare occasions can you really get excited about a breakfast buffet they have good quality food for the full buffet and good enough for the cold those little boxes of cereal are always okay the lone waiter bordered on indifferent and gets a demerit for giving himself a 20 gratuity for a buffet i later was told by the manager that 20 is industry standard for buffet service so they add it for your convenience i have actually never had that added to my bill for a buffet breakfast at any other hotel in the united states i was a party of 1 plus 20 for almost no service its a buffet people but i realize that some people tip the guy at mcdonalds for handing them their food so for those people im sure this would be a nonissue 
dinner food was very good and they had a good selection of wines by the glass yes they did add the industry standard 20 gratuity to the room service tab that one i have seen everywhere before so no issue there
so would i come back if i needed to be in this part of town probably its a well run hotel in a good location and my company got a very good rate making it a great value versus most nearby hotels",4.0
mixed bag  depends on what is important to you,"my family and i 2 adults 1 teen 1 child just spent the night at the residence inn charlotte south 177 as we were driving back home from our florida vacation i chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and its proximity to the roads we were using to drive home i usually have no problems following reviews on trip advisor and am very happy with the results but this time i was disappointed and have a mixed review
first the pros
1 hotel located conveniently for easy access to i77
2 the staff was very friendly helpful and polite about 15 minutes after checkin they called our room to see if everything was satisfactory and if we needed anything at breakfast on sunday morning the staff was very friendly polite and efficient they made our belgium waffles for us cleared our table as soon as we were done with an item and gave us advice about the drive home 
3 the room was very large and let us really spread out we stayed in a two bedroom room both bedrooms had queen beds full bathroom and tvs there was also a living room between the two rooms that had a small sofa desk chair gas fireplace and another tv there was a small kitchen as well  with basic serving for four stove full fridge etc with our aaa discount we had a rate of about 125 a night 
4 free breakfast on the sunday morning we were there they offered scrambled eggs biscuits and gravy sausage bacon grits oatmeal belgium waffles made as requested oatmeal cold cereals and muffins they food was nice but typical of hotels that offer breakfast 
5 there was a tiny pool on property and an outdoor grill 
cons
1 noisy we stayed in their hirise building on the second floor a three level rectangular building with one tiny elevator and rooms indoor front entrances equally distributed on either side of it the walls were very thin and noise traveled easily we could hear neighbors flushing toilets showers walking around upstairs the elevator bell we were four rooms down from the elevator and even the train whistle from the tracks up the road none of the noise that bothered us was people being rude or rowdy  just everyday living noises  so it was nothing to complain about and have fixed  it was a function of the building with very thin walls 
2 dated while functional and clean the room was very dated in appearance cracks dents and dings all over this does not usually bother us  but there were so many here coupled with the old decor  it was hard not to notice 
3 bed soft the bed was also too soft for my preference as well it was not saggy as in old  just too soft and not high quality 
maybe the garden style rooms would have been quieter  i dont know however the cons noise and bed are things that are really important to me in a hotel as i am a very poor and light sleeper so i will not be returning to this property but i didnt just want to give a negative review instead i tried to portray all aspects of this property so that others could decide based on what is important to them",3.0
excellent service2 small complaints being very picky,it was fantasticthe service was exceptionalevery staff member we encountered was very friendly helpful and attentive our only complaints and they are small oneslack of water pressure in the spa suites andlolhorrible quality toilet paper,5.0
above all expectations,"i picked this room up with my points and got a steal with how little points i was spending and reading the reviews here i figured it was at least worth a gamble the lobby was beautiful and the restaurant was new 
we landed early on a friday and they accommodated my family by giving us a very early checkin so i didnt have to keep our luggage in the back of the pickup truck  my wife was not happy about the pickup truck hah
their generosity didnt quit they gave me a bunch of drink coupons that i regret i couldnt use them all a nice bag of goodies at check in free appetizer etc dinner costed me like 16 w tip that night kids eat free for breakfast the food was fabulous the breakfast was top notch
the room was a typical hotel room they all look the same to me now the view looked over the airport and i could see downtown in the distance my family was stoked and i was a hero for picking such a great place",5.0
ambience taken to the extreme,although a hip and buzzy hotel was expected this was ambience gone mad inadequate lighting throughout the whole hotel and it was almost impossible to see the floor numbers on the buttons in the lift the dark atmosphere was far too oppressive looks have been designated as more necessary than comfort the room was ridiculously small for the price charged hardly room to go to the toilet in the bathroom area cleaning was inadequate in the hall areas of the floor that we were on air conditioning very noisy in the room and the blinds inadequate to keep out the early morning light bed too small for average height man inadequate storage space for clothes and suitcases overall a hugely disappointing experience such a shame  great location and the idea is good but it is at the price of common sense and comfort,2.0
great hotel for families,"i really really liked the affinia dumont for our family trip to nyc it is not the biggest flashiest hotel in new york but it has a nice friendly feeling the front lobby is small but has everything you need the staff was wonderful and very helpful the rooms are very big for new york standards we had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds and a sitting room  plenty of room for my husband and i and our two kids ages 9  12 the room even had a small fully functioning kitchen which was great the beds were comfortable which you want after a long day touring the city you can hear the traffic outside but hey it is nyc you not here for the peace and quiet the decor is beginning to show its age but i thought the hotel was well kept 
originally i thought we should book a hotel in the center of times square  i am soooo glad we didnt times square is manic and way to touristy the dumont is located within walking distance of times square less than 15 minutes and it is very close to the empire state building there is also a nice selection of restaurants near by to suite a variety of budgets the barking dog cafe is right next door and is really good 
i would definitely recommend the dumont to any traveling families you can not go wrong with the location or the value for money",5.0
sls style lacking substance,"i recently stayed here for two nights on a business trip 
if the underlying philosophy of this hotel is to create a hotel room that does not look like a hotel room then the proprietors have succeeded alas many conventional design features in hotel rooms serve a functional purpose for example it is fine to have lights that do not look like lights but not if they only illuminate a patch or two of the rug and it is fine to have chairs and sofas that do not look like chairs and sofas but not if they are so uncomfortable that no human being would want to sit upon them and an illuminated clock goodness how jejune lets get rid of it but it sure would have been useful in the middle of the night and a master light switch near the bed not very slick lets not have one etc
other annoyances
the lobby was so dark that when i came in from the california sunshine i had to stand for a minute for my eyes to adjust 
the lobbyreception staff wasnt that attentive and when attentive creepily obsequious 
the fun little sayings riffing off sls for example in business center surf lovely sites these were posted everwhere i dubbed them stupid little sayings and came up with some of my own including the title to this review subpar lighting systems so laughably smug staff largely smarmy and so on 
fortunately i am an early riser so the loud conversations taking place outside my door from 430am530am didnt bother me that much 
it was not all bad of course there was a certain feeling of luxury the bed was quite comfortable they had dishes of these tasty miniapples near the elevator the pool and gym looked nice though i didnt have a chance to use them 
my last visit i stayed in the sofitel around the corner and i much prefer it",3.0
excellent location very comfortable hotel,i was on business when i stayed at the hotel in january 2011 the hotel is in a great location just one block from the gaslamp quarter where there are lots of shops and restaurants the staff were very welcoming and when one of my colleagues experienced a flight cancellation after checking out the staff member put her back in her room and even ended up extending her stay at the conference rate the business center also offered free computer use and printing which was nice for printing boarding passes i had breakfasts and a few lunches in the hotel restaurant and it was very good i also thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop bar the room itself was fine with a working area although the chair really needed to be replaced as it was about shot,4.0
really nice,"i have enjoyed staying at the roger smith hotel on lexington and 47th several times the rooms while older in style and fixtures are very comfortable and clean the bed is really nice with a pillow top and several styles of pillows to choose from each room has a small collection of hardcover books for your use and i am sure you can take one after you check out  courtesy says to replace it with another or return it on your next trip 
i also enjoy the continental breakfast which is included with the room rate it has more than the usual american style pastriescereal yogurt croissants juices excellent strong coffee whole fruits bagels and bread that is more like dinner rolls i think this is to appeal to the foriegn travelers as i have met quite a few of them on my visits there
you cannot beat the location and price of this hotel while in the big apple",4.0
great location great rooms,"no complaints at all about the hotel it is perfect to everything pier 39 and 42 close to transport cheap taxi from the airport 
room was a good size for san fran air con was good bathroom great and big staff extremely helpful at all times quick check in and out extremely efficient young male works on the front desk he needs an award 
only downside is the restaurant next door which offers extremely poor service at all times and has very rude staff avoid at all cost we had vouchers for breakfast so went each day we were no too concerned as we had booked room only so breakfast was an added bonus",4.0
great location  great hotel,this hotel is in such a fantastic location  very centrally located on club row our room was very comfortable  quiet  and not at all cramped which is what one sometimes finds in nyc the staff was also very helpful i would not recommend the restaurant that is in the hotel  we tried it for both breakfast and dinner and found the food mediocre and expensive for what it was next time i will try the diner recommend by the other reviewers we received a decent rate online through quikbook and would definitely stay again at this rate,5.0
amazing hotel with even better views and really friendly and professional staff,i stayed there 4 nights in dec 2010 first time in new york with husband and we both really loved the hotel which made our stay even more special giving us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates the location was perfect the room really big with such an amazing view the staff very professional and friendly room very clean and everything was thought of,5.0
great stay at the westin,"my husband and i have stayed at this westin two or three times most recently in october 2009 i have to say that this hotel keeps getting better and better the lobby is spacious and modern and the rooms are comfortable and inviting one of my favorite touches was water flavored with freshcut fruit in the lobby 
rooms the beds are ultracomfy and luxurious the tvs are flat screen and every possible amenity is at your fingertips the views of the harbor and the sweeping downtown skyline are simply gorgeous the rooms are so nice that it almost makes it hard to leave but of course san diego is such an amazing city that you just have to get out and explore 
location the location cant be beat the westin is only steps from horton plaza little italy downtown seaport village and the embarcadero petco park is only a few blocks away walk to the embarcadero and hop on a ferry to coronado stay here if you want to be close to everything that downtown san diego has to offer restaurants shopping nightlife etc 
service we received excellent service from the front desk staff and especially from the free shuttle service we needed transportation to several appointments and a wedding and the shuttle drivers were more than accommodating in helping us and our friends get to where we needed to be 
i highly recommend this hotel to anyone making a visit to downtown san diego",5.0
very disappointed in our outcome it could have been great but wasnt,"this hotel has some definite pros and cons many of which other reviewers mentioned a couple pros even the smallest room which we had is big for new york standards the staff was quiet but still courteous and helpful and the rates were reasonable lobby spacious and pretty with computers they had some kind of spalike aromatherapy thing going on scentwise which my sister loved but was a little much for me we didnt try the restaurant or fitness center but both looked perfectly acceptable and we didnt venture over to the pool at the other affinia nearby but thats a nice option
some cons slow elevators lots of noise from renovation room next door to us no coffee maker also we were told our my affinia requests were ready and waiting which they werent and never did show after repeated requests im torn over the location yes its walkable to times square 30 rock but definitely not a stroll really convenient to grand central and empire state building only close to green line of the subway i guess it depends how close to the action you want to be
so we went into this fully aware of those types of details from tripadvisor but i had high hopes that the shelburne could exceed because we were using a gift certificate that i won at a charity auction the certificate was issued by the hotel itself and invited the recipients to be special guests of the shelburne it wasnt specific as to what that meant exactly but with a 1000 value it seemed like that could be a really nice weekend let me just say they were kind enough to tweak the terms right away letting us check in a day earlier than specified and also letting us add an extra day for a reasonable price but from that point on our experience was not so hot 
from my initial contact with the manager david i had asked what would be included in our weekend as special guests their words not mine the manager said that because the room was a 500 value it had two beds our first 2 days were the full value of the certificate no meals no extras no drink at the bar okay not what i was expecting to hear but surely a 500 room surely would be nice right wrong when we arrived they stuck us in one of the smallest rooms across from the elevator right next to a room under contruction one morning we were not so pleasantly roused from sleep by a drill the next day a shop vac the bathroom vanity was ridiculously tiny with no shelf or anything with only the back of the toilet for keeping your toiletries handy which is not great for three people i realized pretty much right away that this was not a 500 room a quick check online put our room at 250 with the larger more suitelike rooms going for 369 and up and i was really irked when i saw online that this room says max 2 people when you are booking and here they stuck three of us in there our room had no coffee maker no lovely granite pantry or kitchenette but we managed to squish some drinks and snacks in around the honor bar items yes we fit just fine but this was not what was implied by the certificate if it had been just me or my family i would have complained quite vigorously but i was with friends who didnt want to move or make a fuss compared to other rooms they had experienced in new york ie no room to walk around bed no room for luggage etc this one was pleasant and decently sized and they were not inclined to want to move i went along with that to make my friends happy but i was getting more and more steamed at the special guest line because no my affinia amenities ever showed up even after repeated requests they never delivered the paper as promised also part of me was expecting at least a hi how are we doing phonecall or a welcoming note but nothing and i kept hoping our my affinia complimentary kit would show up with the maid at some point or that internet would be comped or they would remember they had invited us as special guests for the weekend and offer us a drink or some breakfast but they never did not even a peep 
affinia has a long way to go to reach the level of service that they boast we visit new york frequently and affinia had the chance to win over new customers and they failed actually falling quite flat in my experience kimpton properties still win hands down it really felt like the shelburne shut us away in the closet despite the promise the weekend offered 1000 value my foot you dont want to rush back to a place where you are not treated fairly",3.0
great for the price,within walking distance to wharf very economical considering prices of other hotels nearby continental breakfast is more than just donuts and coffee but cereal fresh fruit muffins juice etcand is included in price front desk was very helpful wdirections and transportation rooms are cute  clean whbo only 2 flaws i could find was 1most rooms dont have a view but if youre not in your hotel or dont mind walking 2 blocks to the wharf its not an issue and 2any san fran hotel is going to cost you 30day in parking but youre so close to cable cars wharf  busses that we didnt need a car for our stay,5.0
what a great place beyond our expectations will definitely stay again,we stayed here for 4 nights and found our room very large for new york with a separate bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room in order to save money we used the kitchen every dayit all worked and the fridge was full size the staff at the concierge desk went out of their way to make our stay pleasant gave us directions and they always asked if there was anything else we needed it is in a central location right across from madison square garden clean comfortable and a true bargain the street noise took a day to get used to but i loved leaning out the window and watching the cabs and people mill around penn station we will stay here again next time were in new york,5.0
it was great thank goodness,"i booked a double at the chruchill for over the christmasnew year holidays despite some dreadful reviews here  but because of a few good ones it was really great we went to visit our son and wanted someplace convienent easy walk to dupont cirlce and metro with a restaurant very good food and open all day with a decent size room as we knew wed spend more time than usual in the room it was more than fine even with another separate little sitting area room service till 11 i think and the staff were all very nice and helpful it probably isnt great for business people and they dont have mini bars or room safes
we will be returning to dc and will certainly stay at the churchill",4.0
mixed review,"i stayed at the hyatt for a conference the conference rate offered to the attendees was the same as the regular rate posted on the hotel website which i found a little odd the hotel is in a great location convenient to bart and right on the embarcadero the ferry building across the street is a fantastic place with wonderful restaurants and shops  we ate there several times during the conference we also were lucky to have wonderful weather and it was great to be able to stroll out of the hotel for a nice walk along the bay
the hotel is nice but not outstanding my room had a bay view i paid for the upgrade and a balcony which was nice  beautiful morning view of the piers the weird thing is if you sit on the very comfortable balcony furniture you cant see anything because the concrete railing is tall and thick the room as noted in other reviews was nice but kind of basic very nice bed and bedding and very comfy desk chair but the bathroom is kind of vintage and the lighting over the bathroom sink is pretty bad my room also had studs on the wall where apparently a framed picture once was gave the room a halffinished look 
the temperature control in the room was inefficient theres one vent near the ceiling that pushes air in the general direction of the tv takes a while to cool or warm the room which was a problem as the large balcony doorwindow meant it was a bit drafty also in my bathtub the shower faucet was loose enough that it wouldnt stay put at the chosen temperature the handle would just slowly sink until the water was scalding i solved it by wedging a cardboard coffee cup sleeve from the coffee service between the handle and the rest of the fixture to stop the thing from sliding down but sheesh
i didnt eat in the hotel as there are so many other lessexpensive options in the area you have to pay 10 daily for internet which always annoys me in hotels especially those with rates like the hyatts 
housekeeping also was very late the first day i was there ie returned to a still uncleaned room at 430pm it was subsequently cleaned earlier not sure if that had to do with the fact that i leave a daily tip with a thank you note housekeeping staff i passed in the hallway were unfailingly friendly and courteous
i cant recommend the hyatt for people who are expecting true 4 or 5 star accommodations although the location is great and the staff are good",2.0
great place to crash,rooms were nice with refrigerator and microwave the continental breakfast could have been better i was able to print my boarding pass from their computer in the lobby and they did not charge a fee beds were very comfortable they are right next to the on ramp that takes you to lax and yet you do not hear any freeway noise from the room which was nice,4.0
great hotel in a great area,"this hotel is situated in a great area for the metro very safe and clean area
the hotel is very good with the staff very helpful the room was a very good size and the kitchen area great for cooking your own food especially from safeway on the next block the two cooker rings microwave and toaster were more than adequate
the only slight critisism would be the lack of anywhere to hang clothes and towels in the bathroom you could not even put clean clothes on the toilet and there was no lid to the seat  a couple of hooks on the door would not go amiss but this was a very minor problem in an otherwise top class room",5.0
wonderful experience,we were in town for a family wedding and had a complicated set of reservations with people constantly coming and going the staff were wonderful they helped us with reservations and transportation helped search for a lost item checked on our wellbeing and were without exception exceedingly friendly and helpful the rooms and the lobby area are not large but that is not unusual for an urban boutique hotel we got a great rate through snique away the location was perfect for our purposesonly a couple of blocks from the t for the younger members of our groupand having an au bon pain right across the street was very convenient too very good stay,5.0
good for business travelers,"my husband and i recently stayed three nights in the hotel felix for pleasure the hotel was clean and modern but quite small in size the room is fine for business travelers and couples with no children im very glad we found a sitter because there is no way we could have squeezed a packnplay in that room and still have met fire safety standards 
the hotel staff was very polite i would suggest going down to the front desk if you have an issue however each time we called guest services they did not complete the task even after hours of waitingfor cups or pillows easy things but after going down the desk they were given to us right away 
the location was quite good a few blocks away from the michigan ave near the cathedral district there is a whole foods kitty corner from the hotel which is quite convenient 
overall nice for a quick weekend trip with your sig other or a business trip but not if you have kids",4.0
perfect choice,"excellent hotel in its class
very good location just minutes from broadway and 5th avenue
price  quality ratio very interesting
all personnel is competent friendly and smiling i would like to especially thanks to monika who was really helpful and professional she advised mi excellent restaurant to it",4.0
will definitely stay here again,"i cant believe how good this hotel is ive just come back from staying here 10 days and loved every minute of it
i booked through expedia  and because it was sooo cheap i thought that maybe it wouldnt be that good  but boy was i wrong as soon as we arrived outside i couldnt believe how good it looked the staff were very helpful and the room was much much bigger then i expected it was also very clean kitchen and bathroom were both spotless and still quite new
its location is also great  about 5 min walk from times sq  but the best thing is that it is accross the road from penn station  so all u have to do is cross the road and u can travel virtually anywhere in manhatten i advise anyone considering staying in new york to stay here  you wont be disappointed",5.0
pleasant  great location,"am visiting nyc for 4 nights and the location of this hotel has been amazing im mainly here to see shows and they are literally in my doorstep 
its good value too
lovely helpfull staff
downside is that the walls are v thin and on the first night we were kept awake by our neighbours after a long day travelling that is not what you need but they were politely asked to be quiet and then we could get some more sleep
would definitely stay here again though and recommend it to others",4.0
fabulous stay,"i recently stayed one night at the inn on my way to take a cruise out of the port of baltimore the next day the rooms were very nice clean and roomy the staff there was fantastic from helping us with our bags to providing a great breakfast the next morning i would definitely stay there again
after i got there and told the deck clerk that i was leaving on a cruise the next day she pointed out that they offered a cruising package where i could leave my car there and be shuttled to and from the port rather than having to drive my self to the port and park my car there it was actually cheaper than driving to the port they use a driving service called executive first transportation they were great we even used them when we went out to dinner that evening in little italy their vehicles were spacious and very clean they always arrived on time to drop us off and pick us up it was a great relief not having to try and figure out how to navigate our way around the city definitely a great stay",5.0
location location location,weve stayed at many of the hotels in and around times square over the years but what a delight it was to find the newly renovated hilton garden inn on 8th avenue hilton is trying very hard to cast the garden inn chain between the doubletree and regular hiltons and this property certainly fit the bill we loved the fresh baked cookies at check in and the cooler of ice cold lemonade even if it was country time was a welcomed relief as nyc sweltered through a heat wave on top of that the certificates for the free bottle of water from the pantry was a welcomed and unexpected bit of relief we upgraded to a corner room and it was spacious and comfortable i understand it is a company policy but i have to admit it seems kinda silly to charge hilton honors guests 15 for this upgradeyou should just provide a gratis upgrade for hilton honors members like other chains do for their valued loyal members on the other hand offering free wifi when marriott and others hit you up for this fee more than made up the difference my only other concern about hilton garden inns not just this property is the thread count for bathroom towels and bed sheets the beds are very comfortable sleep number beds that allow you to adjust the firmness of the mattress for each side of the bed what a shame to waste such a nice feature with sheets that were stiff unyielding and noisy indeed the sheets and towels is the only reason i couldnt rate this hotel a 5 but i recognize it is true for all garden inns what this property has hands down however is a fantastic location youre one block from the hershey and mm stores six blocks from times square and literally less than one block from several big name theaters and restaurants in fact we were able to eat shop and see the shows we had tickets for and never walked further than five blocks with the temperature near 100 degrees each day we were there having a hotel in such close proximity to everything was terrific finally i offer high compliments to all of the hilton garden inn times square stafffrom the front desk to the security guards to the housekeeping staff everyone was friendly offered assistance and seemed genuinely pleased that we were their guests as a result of this weekend this hotel property has assumed the  1 spot on our list of favorite places to stay when visiting new york city you cant go wrong here,4.0

a wonderful experience that was good for the soul,"my husband  i recently stayed at this wonderful hotel and i would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who is visiting chicago we stayed here for 2 nights and the staff were excellent in their professionalism and warm rapportthe amenities are first class the room was a great size and the restaurants had a fantastic choice of menu optionsthe hotel is situated in a great position that offers easy access to all sight seeing opportunities and shopping
anyone who is visiting chicago must stay at the swissotel as it is good for the soul

same as last 5 years good fun and very convenient,"have been coming here on first weekend in december for 6 times now not much has changed but i still love being smack in the middle of the best chicago has to offer everyting is nearby and the christmas shopping spirit is full omn recession what recession youd never know there was one if all you did was walk up and down michigan avenue for 10 blocks in either direction
the rooms are modest in size and not well cllimate controlled due to the windows good for cooling drinks the decor is a bit tired as are finishes the lobby is hopping and fun i have never stayed in a hotel with such a social lobby bar area and kudos to marriott for making it so
ill be here again next year for another four nights",4.0
nice rooms good stay,"i just got back from 4 nights at the hilton lax i had read a couple of bad reviews here and was wary fortuneatly those fears were dashed as soon as i opened the door to my room on the 13th floor
my room was spacious and very clean yes the bathroom is small but i was travelling by myself so that was not a concern the bathroom was clean and showed no signs of wear and tear the shower put out a nice steady stream of hot water which is always a plus to me
the king side bed was terrific a little on the soft side which i prefer
the only negatives i had the maid neglected to put face cloths in the bathroom 2 nights in a row the other i ordered a pizza and a couple of slices were burnt i would have sent it back but i wasnt that hungry anyway and couldnt have finished those slices i highly recommmend the chick and rice soup i had that 2 nights in a row and it was delicious
another post mentioned the elevators from the parking garage they are not scary and work just fine just a little on the slow side perhaps but they only service about 4 floors so its really no big deal
my company booked this room through priceline at just 60 a night a great bargain in my opinion ive already told my boss to book me there again the next time i travel to la",4.0
overview of my stay at the omni,"we just returned from an eight night stay at this hotel the location was great very convenient to the metro many restaurants within a couple of blocks there was also a cvs between the metro stop and the hotel 
 checkin was pleasant i asked if we could get a room with a refrigerator and was told that would be an extra 2500 per night we didnt want to pay that for 8 nights so the girl at the front desk suggested we take the stuff out of the mini bar and use it sounded like a good plan until we got to the room and found out the mini bar had not been installed yet we had one of the newer remodeled rooms the coverings for the bed had not yet arrived so we only had sheets and a very thin feather comforter with no duvet cover on it there was no dust ruffle so the box springs were exposed not a big deal but it did take away some from the overall experience of a nice hotel it seemed to me that they remodeled very halfheartedly the bathroom sink was new but the holes from the old one were still in the wall no attempt had been made to patch or cover them they hadnt replaced the old rusted dirty blinds in the bathroom they really stood out not much water pressure in the shower and there was no massaging shower head like the hotel claimed to have in all rooms the room did have a large flat screen tv personally i would rather have a regular tv and have a minifridge and small microwave
the room itself was very clean housekeeping was excellent we returned everyday to a spotless room 
noise was our only real problem during the day the construction from nearby rooms made it impossible to rest it sounded like it was in our room the air conditioner was so loud it woke us up just about every time it turned on or off we had to run the fan on it constantly to try to drown out all the noises around us every door in the hallway slammed loudly when shut i attempted to close ours quietly and it just wasnt possible 
we had no problems with the staff everyone was very friendly and helpful the hotel itself is beautiful im sure the rooms will be when the bedding finally arrives 
overall it was a pretty nice stay i would have been really disappointed and upset if i had paid full price for the room for what we ended up paying it wasnt all that bad",2.0
great location but be careful which room to choose,this hotel is part of the personality hotels group and i stayed at other hotels before always having been very satisfied this time i was a bit disappointed as the room was tiny without window and got very hot as there was no aircon either i was expecting a small room as it was explained on the hotels website but not that small as the price was actually not that cheap in comparison to standard sized rooms in other hotels in the union square area apart from that the location is excellent just 200m away from the powell st cable car stop and around the corner from union square also very conveniently located to powell st bart station and transportation to the airport the design is also very modern and very nice they served coffee every morning and wine every afternoon in the hotel lobby which is a nice touch i wish i had stayed in one of the other room types i probably would have been more satisfied but i cannot recommend the economy class room category at all,3.0
nice place to be but get ready to be nickle and dimed,this hotel really is a great place if you are on a layover at detroit airport the hotel is right in the concourse and even has its own security personnel so you can clear security without having to face the long lines elsewhere the rooms are great with the super heavenly bed that westin offers the food is excellent and the meeting rooms are very good the downside is that the staff especially the front desk tend to be brisk and borderline rude the other negative is that the hotel nickle and dimes the customer to death 16 for internet access  a bit high plus 250 for a local phone call ridiculous as well after a certain period of time you start getting dinged 10minute even after paying 250 for a local phone call i ended up going downstairs and using a payphone rather than pay what they wanted for a local call the hotel unfortunately is using their convenience to squeeze more money out of its patrons in the form of local calls and internet access etc while the food is good it certainly is overpriced as is everything at the hotel,4.0
not the greatest,"the hotel was very convenient to times square but that was pretty much the extent of what i liked about this hotel
the lobby was nice too but the rooms were very standard and somewhat old
the hallways were hot as were the elevators
the ac window unit in the rooms were a pain because the curtains covered it up
at night we had two choices 1 run the ac and keep the curtains open couldnt sleep with the light shining in 2 run the ac with the blinds closed keeping any air from circulating throughout the room not the best feeling for a summer night
the bathroom was very small with no where to place your things
there were zero additional pillows or blankets available
each night we had to ask for additional towels to be brought up to the room
the doorman wouldnt allow me to use the luggage cart when i was checking out so we had to lug everything down to the lobby ourselves i couldve used his services but after a few days in nyc i was tipped out
finally upon checkout i was told the valet would bring my car around in 15 minutes so after the above mentioned trek down to the lobby with all of our stuff we had the pleasure of waiting in the lobby for over 1 hour for our vehicle
i probably wont be returning to this hotel anytime soon",2.0
finally a place to stay in this part of town,i first found ink48 when they offered special room rates for their soft open in 2009 i have been coming back ever since it is my nyc hotel of choice unless rates are through the roof  which can happen in nyc the hells kitchen neighborhood has so much to offer  especially great cafes and dining spots along 9th the hotel is a kimpton which always makes me happy  robes free wifi wine hour and a very reasonable upgrade plan the view from the city view rooms at dusk and dawn are worth it  especially if you can get a photo the hudson suite  one of their premier suites on each floor offers a beautiful hudson view i think i have stayed in every size room this hotel offers and i am always comfortable the bath products are either aveda or italian and when you have a soaking tub they leave you salts the soaking tubs are so worth the room upgrade but all of the bathrooms are topnotch i have not had an inside room which might be a bit claustrophobic but the lobby lounge is a comfortable hangout spot with a giant wooden table and comfy chairs i have also dined at the inhouse restaurant print and the food is consistently delicious the press lounge is a great place for a drink while you soak in the city views the staff are attentive and respectful  i truly feel like ink48 is my second home the only draw back is there is not a subway stop close by but the walking feels great,5.0
would definitely stay again,i was a bit leary from the reviews on here but i was more than satisfied with my stay here i booked on priceline and then upgraded to a suite when we got there only 40 more a night  cant beat that we were on the 5th floor overlooking the construction site yes it was noisy but i was well aware it was going to be didnt damper our stay the people were very friendly they helped with check in and upon check out came over and asked how our stay was etc always greeted when we came in from outside the breakfast wasnt bad the food was ok and the price was ok it was very convenient and the view is great there was 3 of us staying me my husband and my 8 yr old daughter would stay again in a hearbeat definitely also recommend the blt grill right down the street in the w hotel great food,4.0
luxurious resort without hurting my wallet,this hotel really is grand the hotel rooms were beautiful and spacious also clean clean clean the landscape around the resort was breathtaking centrally located in the city close to shopping and movie theaters we did take a some time for the spa what a treat the friends we went there with went back the following summer with their kids a very family friendly place yet we went needing quiet and relaxation and never heard any kids best of both worlds,5.0
great even with lobby under refurbishment,great location on the nicer side of union square had room on a high floor with a great view room was modern and nicely furnished lobby was being refurbished but theyve done a great job at the temporary setup  you could easily not notice anything was going on,5.0
ok but disappointing for a seasoned traveler,"check in confronted with a clerk who clearly could not care less got to our room a single for 2 people with a weeks reservation and we paid premium prices nope went back down to the desk stated our case the first clerk told us this was the room grade for 1800hotelscom guests fortunately mohammed was able to find us a slightly larger room and kept apologizing about the lack of view i just was happy to be able to get to the bathroom without tripping over my spouse so room amenities were fine the problem came in the bar when we asked for a rocks glass  a wine glass for the room we were told that the bar was separate from the hotel and could not accomadate us so why could i charge my bar tab to my room just dont lie to your customers in hope of one more round believe me we found a place that sold glasses so we could have a quiet drink in our room and we spent plenty in that bar anyway so why unsult us of by being greedy 
i have to complain about one blond bartender on our friday night who was so rude as to be deservedly fired she was so busy chatting up some lawyer type that she got completely snooty when an irish patron asked her to repour his beer with a proper head and an englishman who rightly complained when she poured him bourbon instead of the scotch he requested i dont need attitude from a server its why they are there",3.0
good location  enjoyed our stay,"we took the bart from sfo airport to embardadero last stop and the hotel was only a 5 minute walk from here the hotel is in a good location 5 mins walk to the ferry building and about 20 mins walk to pier 33 alcatraz departures with the main fishermans wharf area a further 5 mins
the room was very modern with a very comfortable bed the rooms were reasonably clean but nowhere near what i would expect from the le meridien no coffee making facilities in the room unless you ask we did and they immediately delivered a great coffee machine with starbucks coffee filters v good bathroom accessories provided were minimal eg no shower cap small touches provided in most other hotels of this standard concierge was really helpful pub across the road elephant  castle was good
we ate breakfast at loris diner on powell street 50s style diner about a 15 min walk from the hotel and twice at the eagle cafe on pier 39 following a recommendation which was v good about 30 min stroll from the hotel which is needed to walk off the huge portions
if you are visiting for leisure then make sure you go to alcatraz the highlight of our stay and the tram station was also very interesting",4.0
good value for the money,clean room small but comfortable bed no hand towels in roomeven when we asked at the front desk they gave us more washcloths quality of breakfast needs improvement overall good value,4.0
top notch service great location,"i had never heard of the library hotel however based on the reviews i read decided to give it a try great decision every single employee we met was friendly and very happy to assist in every way possible the bed was very comfortable and the room extremely clean loved the reading room on the second floor which provided snacks and beverages around the clock continental breakfast each morning including fresh fruit and wine cheese and snacks in the evening the service here was superb as wellwe have stayed at other hotels that provided happy hour but here they actually come to your table to see if everything is okay and to offer refills 
the hotel is in a great location walking distance to grand central station and bryant park which is beautiful
we stored our luggage after check out so that we could tour the city a bit prior to catching the train home and were told that we were welcome to visit the 2nd floor when we came back to retrieve our luggage a very nice touch  even though we were checked out they still wanted us to be comfortable until we caught our train
we have stayed at many hotels around the world and the service here was definately at the very top of the list will definately be back",5.0
mixed feelings about this hotel but generally positive,"we had two rooms at the belvedereone executive double and one executive king it is essential to book the executive rooms otherwise dont bother definitely worth the extra  the location was perfect for us the double room was spacious for three people although the beds were a bit small for two people who are used to a queen the bathtub was wonderful the king room was great for two people but the bathtub not as deep apparently not all rooms have the same set up all beds were very comfortable the microwave and fridge were added bonuses although the fridge in the king room was too cold and ruined some of our food 
the decor was pleasant the rooms clean and the elevators not as bad as we had read use the service elevator as a back up i would recommend this hotel especially if you can get a good deal it is better than others we have stayed in at a similar pricelocation",4.0
great location,hotel 71 is located on wacker and michigan a great location for anywhere to go in downtown chicago everywhere is in a walking distance including the metro train the room is spacious adequate but not luxurious there is a good coffee maker in the room and a free wifi internet which is a plus there is a small gym which i think is rather limited this modern day people are health conscious and exercise is very important for frequent business travellers there is only one tread mill that is not enough but better than most places that have none i will have no hesitation to stay at this hotel again,4.0
not overly impressed,my husband and i spent three nights at the warwick and enjoyed our stay upon our checkin we immediately got an upgrade at no extra charge the rooms are pretty compact but comfortable i expected the bed to be a little more comfortable than it was we were also a little disappointed that there were only three very small drawers for clothing i left most in my suitcase and hung the rest all in all the hotel was very nice compact and charming just not that outstanding the elevator is big enough for about three people which added to the charm actually for the price i think well try another hotel next time staff at the front was young and maybe a little indifferent good location though,4.0
great location,"my husband and i stayed here over thanksgiving vacation of last year we paid about 200 a night including taxes and fees we loved the quiet uws location its proximity to central park and easy access to the subway we love to walk and explore cities so this was a fabulous place for us to stay when we arrived we were told that we would have access to an outdoor lounge on the 15th floor shortly after we unpacked and got settled we went up to the outdoor lounge and were pleasantly surprised to find it empty beautiful decorated a christmas tree and decorative lighting with fantastic north views of the city
the rooms are spotless nicely decorated and while a bit small the large bathroom size makes up for it
the concierge was more than helpful and when seeing how much luggage we had took us in a hotel car to newark airport on our last day
im not sure if well stay here again as we enjoy trying out different hotels but on the ave was worth every penny",4.0
this hotelwhile in a good location needs better service and a review by corporate,cleaning detail falls short and they really need to hire people who are service oriented and friendly at the front desk,2.0
girls weekend with american girl,"we take a yearly girls weekend there were eight of us ranging in ages from eight to eighty i called the intercontinental hotel ahead to request ajoining rooms two beds in each room and nonsmoking i mentioned that we were going to visit the american girl store as we have two girls with dolls we arrived around noon and to our amazement there were two hot pink star cookies with milk in each room waiting on the bed was a personal invitation to the girls to visit the store and a fold up bed for each one of the dolls as a complimentary gift to the girls you can only imagine how excited the girls were
the hotel staff was great the girls had a fun time in the pool then took their showers in the athletic clubthey supplied everything from shampoo and conditioner to a blow dryer one of the girls did not pack a toothbrush so we called the front desk and they sent up toothbrush and paste we received red carpet treatment we pricelined this hotel and sometimes because of that you get inferior service we did not the staff was awesome and we would go again",5.0
nice hotelbusiness,i visited this hotel for a business trip in the convention area rooms were very clean restrooms clean oh and the view from our room was very nice i liked the convention space the staff was very prompt and made everything room smooth during our lunchs and dinner party was very nice food during our evening meal was only on the fair side there was a nice sports bar on premise very nice parking fees were a little on the high side so be prepared to pay overall a very nice downtown hotel,4.0
top notch,"i loved the wit exceeded expectations on all levels when i arrived checkin was speedy yet personable all the staff was excellent  i wish i wouldve taken note of their names i was recognized as being a hilton gold member and given a couple of breakfast vouchers which could even be used for room service this is uncommon based on my experience
i stayed in the paramount suite which was almost like having my very own condo downtown the room was spotless and full of nice touches with floor to ceiling windows in 3 directions it made for a quite an experience room service in the morning was great and thankfully i had 40 to apply to the bill
i went up to the roof on a saturday night and was provided free cover charge this place is pretty amazing even during the winter  i can only imagine the crowd during the summer despite the noisy atmosphere my room was completely silent even with the l below and the roof bar up top
i definitely will stay here again in certain respects the wit has a few legs up on its conrad sister up north on michigan ave it all depends on what youre looking for",5.0

so choiceif you have the means,i have stayed at this hotel on two different occasions each for 3 nights the hotel is spectacular but you are going to pay for it beds were great room was nice but nothing that would just blow you away the main thing here is the hotel itself very large  beautiful great stay if you are doing something at the convention center next door easy walk to the gas lamp district joes crab shack is just right behind the building which is highly recommended the hotel does have nice bars  food inside though again pricey i would certainly stay here again especially when my company is paying for it,5.0
homeless person sleeping by hotel entrance,dont take a chance very disappointing the hotel is next to a loud multilane freeway on the first night its too dark right outside the entrance walking back from dinner we saw a homeless person sleeping on the ground right before you get into the hotel we saw several homeless roaming around within a block of the hotel at night it was a bit concerning keep in mind this hotel is right next to the freeway 5 after paying for the hotel on hotelscom la quinta charged us again for the stay on our credit card  double hit it was an absolute mess trying to reverse the charge and getting it off our card even through that credit card mess which the front desk person created he was rude condescending unprofessional and didnt really apologized for his mistake the hotel also failed to disclose that they charge for parking its not about the money its about their unprofessional and dishonest attitude when we asked about the additional charge on the card more than one person said that it would be reversed once we check out that wasnt the truth the hotel is very dated and beat up the air conditioner went on and off all night and it sounded like a very loud motor  no restful sleep for us the room was somewhat clean and you can walk to the restaurants in old town san diego  these were the only positives but be careful walking to and from the hotel we crossed a few homelessdrugged people at night and it wasnt the safest feeling well never stay there again,1.0
very friendly and clean,its right where we needed to be in chicago for price and size of room along with breakfast through in a decent pool and hot tube this good enough for me like others said its by the cfd but you would hear at other hotels cause they use same roads it actually made my family feel safe so there you go,5.0
solid choice great location,"stayed here 5 nights apr 610 1 adult w two teenagers very polite and professional staff from front desk bellhop housekeeping concierge etc felt safe walking around this area even at night rooms are tight but this is nyc location couldnt have been better for our purposes touringcollege visits subway station less than a block away grand central ny public library bryant park 5th avenue shopping just a couple blocks over easy walk to times square but far enough away from the maddening crowds only issues  1 tv didnt work in first room but was reassigned next morning no problem they even sent up a technician when we called about 1100 pm to report the issue 2 my laptop got lost in baggage storage  we checked out of room and had to store our bags with the bellhop while we finished up a few last minute errands while loading the car i didnt notice that the laptop wasnt there as much my fault as bellhops as i didnt count the claim tickets as i was a bit overwhelmed trying to pack the car in front of the hotel on busy lexington ave and just wanted to get out of the way upon arrival at our next stop boston i discovered the loss and called the hotel manager immediately connected me with hotel security and they made arrangements for the laptop to be shipped wherever i wanted immediately i directed them to send it to my home as we had a few more stops on our road trip and am awaiting arrival now hotel security called me this morning to see if i had received it yet and when i hadnt he provided me with the tracking number and asked that i call to confirm receipt very professional and responsive despite my somewhat frazzled state 
regarding the renovations there was a notice about this on the reservation page and we did not find it to be a problem at all our first room was on the 10th floor then moved up to 19th after the tv problem at neither room did we find noise to be an issue 
quite a few international guests which adds a nice vibe
enjoyed our visit here and would book here again",4.0
great service great price great view great location,when i walked in i was instantly greeted as a guest should be greated everyone that i passed or encountered provided me with the best service this location is in a great spot just a few steps from a convenient subway the rates were great as well as the views location and service times square was about a 5 minute subway ride away anytime i stay in nyc i will be sure to book at this hotel,5.0
excellent location for conventioneers or sight seers,we were greeted by bellman who was savvy enough to read luggage tags and address us by name as we got out of taxi the hotel is in a landmark building of the city and is ideally situated for events at the convention center visits to reading terminal market and about 34 mile to many of the historic sites the walk was well lighted at night so we felt safe also there was a tremendous number of city police and transit police as well as another area security service in the immediate area the room was a bit tired in that the wall paper was peeling in corners and seams and veneer on furniture was chipped off in places it was clean and quiet restaurant was quite good for a large hotel and prices on food were reasonable prices on bar items was a bit steep though staff was pleasant and helpful in the afternoon a station is set up in the lobby to serve lemonade and citrus water to guests  very welcome after a long day of walking the city there is a pick up station right out the front door for phlash the citys trolley service which serves most of the tourist destinations,4.0

nice accomodations for a reasonable rate,the hilton ny is in a great location very convenient to head anywhere in manhattan either by cab or subway my fiancee and i booked a room for a sat nite stay just a few days beforehand through priceline we got a pretty decent rate 170nt and when checking in asked for a renovated room which we got after reading some of the other reviews i wasnt sure what to expect but we were happily surprised that our room was very clean modern  comfortable overall we had a positive experience at this hotel and its a very good value if you book through priceline or a similar discount travel site,4.0
could be so much more,"the hotel blake is situated on the very busy dearborn st close to the even busier congress parkway and occupies the old morton building the room we were given was of a nice size complete with 2 comfortable chairs and a seat at the bottom of the bed this is one of their upgrade rooms and the bathroom was of a nice size with a walk in shower and 2 wash basins 
the room was unfortunately facing deraborn st and was very noisy making sleep difficult  book a back room if you are a light sleeper the bathroom and entry way are tiled making for cold floors we had the heat set at 85f but never got warm in this large room the air vent was also filthy bathrobes are provided but no slippers on the tile floors meant cold feet
the door to the corridor fitted quite well and if it were not for the street noise i think our sleep would have beeen much better a very slall closet with 4 hangers was available for the room  totally inadequate as was the availabe drawer storage plenty of hot water from the shower but the bathroom had no heat source so always cold and fogged mirrors
the doormen and front desk were always polite and courteous but the free continental breakfast is an insult basically donuts and coffee with about 10 places to sit  most mornings we skipped it as it is unhealthy and an uncomfortable setting not sure why theu bother putting this pathetic attempt on this area becomes a basic bar in the evening  basic beer and wine offerings didnt bother with that either the hotel is next to the custom house restaurant found the food to be fairly good and reasonable wine list  a bit pricey but not a bad option if you dont fancy walking  has a nice bar as well
we were attending a trade fair  room rates of 180 and talking to other guests we over paid by a hefty margin as you can usually get this hotel on hotwire for 90 and that is about what it is worth on its website the hotel proclaims the hotel as a landmark of luxury  frankly i have stayed in better hampton inns",3.0
good location but hotel barely average,i wanted to like this hotel because my past experiences with doubletree have been good and their chocolate chip cookies can sway me to forgive a lot of inconveniences however there were more negatives with this hotel than positives as many other reviewers have said the location is excellent the doubletree is a short walk from beale st and from many wonderful restaurants and clubs they also had nice flat screen tvs in the rooms the hotel has free wifi but as i have learned this generally means bad wifi no streaming videos on youtube with this wifi but its adequate for checking email other reviewers have said the beds are comfortable  but that was not my experience the double beds were too small and hard i am not sure why hotels even put double beds in rooms anymore the halls of the hotel were kept very warm and the smell of cleaning products overwhelms the lobby and hallways the fitness center is a joke  two treadmills one elliptical one bike and free weights two mornings i got up at 530 and had to wait for a treadmill and the third morning i gave up waiting since memphis has one of the highest crime rates in the us i did not feel safe to run outside this hotel should either expand their fitness center or work out a deal for guests with a local gym although i didnt see any gyms around the hotel the air conditioning in the room was very loud and would sometimes wake me up at night when it came on the ice machines were also unbelievably loud there is a tgi fridays in this hotel and i thought it would be convenient for quick lunches but it wasnt avoid tgi fridays if you only have an hour for lunch the two days i ate there they took more than 45 minutes to bring us our salads and sandwiches and offered no apologies i do recommend the nearby flying fish for lunch andor dinner i would have to agree with the other reviewers who found the service at this hotel lacking many of the staff were unfriendly and making guests happy does not appear to be a priority here does management read the trip advisor reviews this hotel could be a gem with some work,3.0
beautiful view  hotel,we stayed here for three nights and wish we could have stayed longer we absolutely loved this hotel our room was literally right on the water we even saw seals and jellyfish from our window the beds were very comfortable and the rooms are really nice i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again,5.0
holiday inn express great location,"great location only a couple of blocks from times square
reception staff were very helpful
good value for money rooms were quite tight as would be expected for something this close to times square
breakfast area is too small for the number of guests but staff do their utmost to make it work and keep people circulating through the area",4.0
much better than expected after seeing previous reviews,we arrived at the hotel at 3am after a sticky start at the airport it was my husbands 50th birthday that day and with all the negative reviews of the past we were anxious however we neednt have been we were upgraded straight away from a standard double and given a corner room with views over central park on the 23rd floor the room was quiet very clean as was the bathroom although it was a little on the small side the shower was very good and we were given plenty of clean towels every day the temp outside was very hot in the late 80s but we had very efficient air conditioning so it wasnt a problem the staff were very friendly and we didnt mind having to use the safety deposit boxes behind the desk as they were very efficient we would definitely use the hotel again you couldnt fault the location a must is the rockefeller centre at night great views of the empire state and all of new york also do the staten island ferry best free trip ever the best bus tours to go on are the gray line  blokes in red waistcoats the night loop to brooklyn is brilliant have a great stay and enjoy,4.0

great location,this hotel is right next to times square so is well situated for the tourist stuff subway station is also nearby hotel rooms are small by us standards and some have not been renovated recently we had 3rd floor room that was a bit tired but asked to be moved and ended up on the 12th floor in a better and quieter room street noise is noticeable on the lower floors free wifi in the lobby was a bonus but could have easily walked across the road to starbucks which is open all night,3.0
omg can we have minus ratings,"2012 texas line dance jamboree was held at this place sorry i can not call it a hotel because it was not from checkin till checkout there were problems im estimating 300 to 400 people staying here for the jamboree on 101912  102012 may have been more or less but an estimated 400 people were expected for the jamboree some were probably fortunate to stay at other hotels
lets start with checkin for these 300 people our first jamboree activity started at 300 pm many people were told that hotel checkin would start at 100 pm by 100 pm there were at least 40 people waiting at the registration desk ready to checkin a little after 100 we were told that checkin would not be until 300 it was requested to speak with the manager a man came out and i think he said he was the assistant manager but i could be mistaken he told us that the rooms were not ready and checkin would not start until 300 many unhappy campers i suggested that since the checkin process takes a while perhaps we could take care of that you know  credit card etc and pick up the room key later oh no that wouldnt work could we get key and not go to room until 300 no couldnt do that i guess he finally saw our mob mentality and perhaps fearing for his life he relented and said ok you can check in but if the rooms not clean youll have to wait ok we agreed to that now  expecting this many people and that most would be checking in around the same time so that we didnt miss the first activity wouldnt you think theyd have several people available for checkin well youd be wrong there were 2 people checking us in after about 30 minutes 2 other ladies showed up to help one of these was a young lady named celine celine was wonderful 
ok let me back up a little we had 21 ladies in our group and when reservations were made months ago we requested that we all be located on the same floor and that we have one hospitality suite well they had us scattered on at least 3 different floors  maybe more celine took some of our names and somehow arranged that most of us were on the same floor however the hospitality suite on the second floor was not ready so in addition to being scattered everywhere our hopitality suite ended up being on the 6th floor no one ever asked for that floor
ok by now its 300 so we rush off to our first activity
problems experienced 
electronic door lock  card wouldnt open the door door wouldnt lock when closed
rooms air conditioning unit didnt work toilet paper holder loose in wall and fell out when you pulled on the paper toilet handle had to be held down several seconds before it would flush and then had to jiggle handle to get water to turn off bugs found under a mattress fortunately they were dead and were not bedbugs but  bed mattress so sunken in middle that one rolled into an abyss i could go on and on
overall there were 4 elevators but one didnt work and another one some people got stuck on for several minutes because door would not open one elevator on saturday the doors just stayed open and it wouldnt move carpets were filthy and worn walls and tiles etc were nasty looking ice machine on floor 2 my floor didnt work finally found one vending machine with pepsi in it that worked dont remember which floor old television set in my room so didnt even turn on someone said they turned theirs on but no reception geez
i could keep going but i think by now you understand that this is not a place to stay room rate was 89 and not worth it id prefer a nice clean laquinta or springhill or any place else 
its not like all these people just showed up on friday they had our reservations for a long time but they acted as though wed just unexpectedly walked in off the street
oh back to the main reason we were there  line dancing jamboree in their 11000 sq ft ballroom well it seems they decided to refinish the rooms wood flooring which sounds nice right but it wasnt completed and the floor was a disaster sticky rough etc
please dont waste your  at this place they should just just the doors and turn out the lights  the partys over",1.0
classy comfortable beds friendly discreet staff,"i stayed here for one night after an unpleasant stay at the hampton inn 
i wish i had stayed here the entire time  the bed was so much more comfortable the staff was very polite and understanding of our needs 
the rooms were a little small but we scored a handicapped room so it was a little bigger than the room my parents were in 
very nice lobby  impressive",4.0

better than expected very convenient to medical services,"stayed here for almost 2 weeks while a relative was hospitalized at beth israel location was very convenient only a block from the hospital and numerous other hospitals as well had a floor on the 6th floor facing the street insulation to the street was pretty poor so the sirens from ambulances which were pretty constant were audible in hotel room this was not a concern for sleep because i brought ear plugs i would recommend this to anyone staying here bed was quite comfortable and there were plenty of pillows the room furnishings were in good condition room clean not sparkling clean but clean enough bathroom pretty small toiletries were very minimal only soap and shampoo no conditioner or lotion at all hair dryer supplied tv channels are pretty limited but as someone else noted in their review the internet here is lightening fast so i was able to watch some tv programs online maintaining temperature in the room was difficult either too cold or too hot it was also hard keeping the water the right temp in the shower pretty variable continental breakfast quite nice served by wait staff in restaurant downstairs the hotel restaurant downstairs was surprisingly good had several very nice dinners there the food court next door was handy as was the cvs adjacent to the food court i recommend upper crust pizza and penguin pizza if you are looking for pizza delivery there is a large movie theatre within walking distance which can provide some much needed respite from the stress of caring for someone in the hospital 
overall i would not hesitate to stay here again however if you are coming to boston for tourism rather than medical services i would look elsewhere not a convenient location to tourist activities",4.0
avg subluxury hotel save wamex promo rate,"although a local resident of dc i decided to stay at this luxurious property for one night with the sole intent of relaxing being pampered by superior service fine dining and the use of their spa 
a member of the free ritzcarlton rewards program i was entitled to an amex promotional rate of 220nt because i am a platinum cardholder so i booked the room wo using pts at the amex travel website because of the following additional benefits none of which were honored by ritz management
 room upgrade if available
 daily continental breakfast for two
 400pm late checkout
 100 foodbeverage credit
long story short avoid this ritz as it is no different then the capital hilton or renaissance both of which are far less expensive 
if you decide against your better judgment continue to read on for detail on what to expect
the large premier room with king bed was very clean but not the least bit luxurious and rather small the bathroom was really fit for just one person the ordinary bathtub was supposed to be a jacuzzi with water jets and fitted with a headrest the separate shower is a tight squeeze even for one person felt a bit claustrophobic the very soft beds are in need of replacement springs seemingly worn down woke up with a soar lower back 
tip if you order room service food  beverages you would be wise to pre negotiate the cost prior to ordering let them know you will pay them in cash i personally saved 150 this way",3.0
old world new world,"we were warmly greeted on arrival and checked very quickly which was good as the afternoon complimentary wine and cheese was about to be served

aother wonderful stay at the palomar,"we returned to the palomar and were not disappointed the staff are all so welcoming and helpful particularly the front desk staff 
i am noisesensitive and love the courtyard rooms at the palomar where you can stay downtown without having your sleep disturbed however the palomar now is petfriendly so do not stay on the 9th floor if noise is an issue ",5.0
clean but basic accommodation  great staff who are very helpful,i stayed here for one week as i was attending a conference at the hotel and thought it would be convenient to just pick the one hotel rather than check into a couple  especially after such a long flight from england the rooms are quite spacious and the cleanliness is to a very high standard  the cleaning staff work very hard the first room i was given was looking at the runway so i moved rooms and was given one overlooking the pool which was a much better view they have a policy of rewarding you with 5 per night if you forego the maid service  i only received 3 vouchers in total even though i left the ticket on my door every night and the queue in the morning at the check in desk was always so long i couldnt be bothered to wait and get my voucher the main thing i would have liked in my room would have been a mini fridge to store my own drinks the internet was 1295 for the night  very pricy albert in the concierge was so helpful and friendly  that guy knows everything about la and the places to check out and nothing is too much trouble the staff on the check in desk were a little frosty and stiff but very professional and polite the starbucks and lobby area makes the hotel feel a bit more luxurious than it actually is however the pool is always a bonus  there is also a spa jacuzzi but its always busy if you want a hotel right near the airport to use as a base to explore the rest of the city or for business then this place is fine but if youre looking for something special and romantic then personally i would choose something well away from the airport and near the vast amount of beaches that are a 2030 min drive away,3.0
great hotel near seattle center,"i stayed at the maxwell to visit the attractions at the seattle center it was very close to before moving to another hotel for sakuracon and i must say that i wish i could have stayed at the maxwell for my whole trip 
let me give you a quick list of the things i loved the room bathroom and shower were nice clean and very very roomy i found the bed to be very comfy there were a lot of good restaurants and 2 good grocery stores within walking distance a fridge and a microwave i made good use of every staff member i ran into was very polite and friendly it was good to have free wifi and a flat screen tv that got hd channels
there were a few things that did not lessen my opinion of how awesome the hotel was but could be a potential dealbreaker for others you can really hear the people walk around and roll luggage on the floor above you pretty clearly the nice big tvs in the rooms had a shelf near it that looked convenient if i had brought a video game console however from what i could tell there were only had composite video inputs and not the hdmi i would have preferred also the hd channels on the tv werent on the hotel provided channel listings but were there way past of all the other sd channels and seemed to be a pretty random selection of what was there the shower was designed to not need any sort of curtain or door but it seemed to me that to make it work and not get water all over the bathroom the shower head was pointed towards a corner and was not adjustable at all that made the very roomy shower seem kinda cramped as i had to huddle in the corner of the shower to stay in the water flow
all of that said i loved loved loved the maxwell hotel the next time i stay overnight in seattle they will be my first and probably only choice",5.0
hilton garden inn was worth the price,my wife and i stayed at the hilton garden inn downtown the evening of jan 1 2011 prior to watching the indianapolis colts we normally stay at the hampton inn downtown but the hilton garden inn was much cheaper i was very impressed by the service complimentary breakfast honor members and the pleasant attitude of the staff the room was on the 5th floor with a king size bed that was perfect for us the bathroom was topnotch and was very comparable to the conrad hilton in indianapolis overall it was a great stay and we intend to stay there again this coming weekend for the colts playoff game self park was 900 and totally convenient across the street and in a covered garage,5.0
decent stay huge difference in staff makes the difference,"decent hotel where we stayed with our kids during our last three days of a five week roadtrip two guys at the front office never must have heard of costumer service since they responed very unfriendly when i told them that i had a confirmed reservation for a queen bed suite they kept telling me that they only could give me a king bed suite so my kids had to sleap on a fold out sofa since they are at an age that it is more fun than a burden it worked out but they never showed any hospitality and never tried to even the situation
luckily the other people at the front desk were much better the other day even in spite of the fact that they couldnt or wouldnt change our room they at least acted professionally
the room was all right and cleaning was excellent
the pool was a mess filled with leaves and insects i would not take a swim in it 
next time i will prefer the westin above this one",3.0
run from this hotel,this is the most horrible hilton ive ever stayed at ill list positives first room was ok  location was greatbut these 2 things would never make me come back to this hilton property the rudest people and most horrible service ive ever encountered hilton needs to send a mystery shopper into this hotel and stay a week and observe how horrible this place is they would immediately remove their hilton logo off the front i wont bore you with every detail  just suffice it to say  as an experienced traveler  this was the most horrible staff and service ever in my travels if you are a hilton member  stay at the hilton on avenue of the amercas run from this hilton if you want to stay right attimes square area  then try marriott marquis crown plaza times square or doubletree do not stay at this hotelunlessyou love horrible rude staffand love horrible service then go aheadstay and enjoy as for meill never be back to this hilton ever,1.0
i need of a total refresh,"i tried to stay at the hilton mission valley as i was hosting an event at the hotel in the conference center the event was great but the rooms leave something to be desired
what i liked not much the service was average the lobby area was clean but dated the location however is good
what i disliked half of the hotel rooms overlook interstate 8 i asked some other tripadvisor reviewers of this hotel how the noise was they said it was tolerable i found it to be too loud i ended up leaving the hotel and going to the doubletree newly remodeled to sleep keeping my event at the hilton mv i found the parking system to be questionable at best i had paid for parking but the meter outside didnt take the card 
if you stay here do not stay in odd number rooms regardless of floor number i was on floor 14 top and the noise from the freeway was almost 20db higher than at the doubletree in the room using a sound meter on my android phone 
in summary i dont plan on coming back its fine if you cant find anything else but i would not recommend this hotel",3.0
great location good servicerooms need makeover,"the omni is a old favorite of mine in houston and this past weekend was our first time back in a couple of years the location is one of the best in houston for access to shopping dining major interstates and even downtown its tucked between a small forest and some office buildings and a new high rise condo but theres very little activity on the weekend from the offices i would even say the setting is serene for a large city hotel the grounds are immaculate with a cool swan pond in front of the property two restaurants and a great bar the black swan 
the service this weekend was friendly prompt and overall above average especially at check in i had requested and they accomidated without my asking again at check in a corner room overlooking the pool and pond these rooms are a bit larger and at end of the hall far from the elevators and service areas however the rooms are in desparate need of an aesthetic makeover especially in the bathroom paint and wallpaper in poor condition bathroom fixtures are loose and turn all the way around the bathroom marble is not in the best condition and they need new shower curtains on the other hand the carpet was in good shape and the bed was very comfortable but im surprised the sheets were not of a better quality i hope they get new tvs when they remodel to catch up with the competition
finally our very fair rate included the buffet breakfast for two in the cafe the food was great especially the fresh berries the service was good but not exactly friendly 
im checking four stars but its really a 3 12 at least until the rooms are remodeled",4.0
tired and just adequate,our family stayed here one night on a cross country trip unfortunately our son age 22 needed to sleep on the pull out sofa it was very uncomfortable the queen sized bed was fine the actual room was adequate although tired looking and sort of dingy it was located in downtown denver but not walking distance to where you would want to go out to eat or walk around breakfast was not very good at all if you wanted a banana and cold cereal you would be ok the breakfsst room wasnt big enough and we had to take our food back to the room to eat,2.0
clean and nice,i was there with my family and felt very secure in their hotel the hotel was newly remodeled and very clean inside and out the staff was very friendly and help the rooms very good size it was a gated parking lot which made it even better it was next to freeway but noise wasnt a problem i would definetly stay there again,3.0
really good location good price and good service,great location downtown walking distance to magnificent mile as well as to bussubwaytrolley stations the manager even gave my son a gift card to area restaurants to treat us on his birthday although rooms were a bit small they were clean and comfortable breakfast at marriott is always great,5.0
gracious southern hospitality lives,"my husband and i just returned from a 3 night stay at the memphis peabody and enjoyed it immensely the georgous lobby lavish details piano playing in the lobby recalled the gracious charm and elegance of a bygone era the twicedaily duck procession to and from that exquisite lobby fountain was too cute for words 
our spacious comfortable room was in the club level on the 12th floor and included a lavish continental breakfast with amazing freshbaked pastries fruits cereals etc our own concierge and valet parking the entire hotel is spotless from the shining marble floors to the woodcarved and stained glass ceiling everyone was so friendly and welcoming most attractions such as beale street civil rights museum mississippi river boat rides shopping all within walking or trolley distance neeleys bbq a little more of a walk but worth the effort

hotel staff apparently stole my iphone and kindle from my hotel bedroom,this hotel seemed fine but i left my belongings in the room before going to dinner and it transpired that when i returned to my hotel room my ipad and kindle had been stolen i realized they had vanished the following morning was very distressed and complained later that day after vigorous pursuit by my office the hotel retrieved my items they didnt so much as apologize and were so inefficient in returning them to me that i nearly missed my plane the fact that my belongings werent safe in my locked room plus the fact that management were unperturbed and not apologetic about causing me extreme stress and inconvenience means id advise anyone to avoid this hotel at all costs,1.0
noisy in the mornings,the hotel is definitely central to everything and makes it convenient room is average probably outdated as they still use shower curtains for showers after a shower the floor is all wet the one thing that i didnt appreciate was woken up at 9 to the sound of housekeeping outside my door vacuuming bumping into things loud talking its only 9 and im trying to sleep not the best hotel if you cant even sleep in some peace and quiet,3.0
another great visit,we have stayed her many times and never a problem the employees are friendly and accomodating and the location cant be beat we asked for a rollaway and it was promtly delivered with no extra charge we asked for extra towels and againquick delivery the lobby is crowded and sometimes chaotic but it makes for good people watching we have stayed at other hotels and have looked at others too but always stick with the st francis fyibeware of all the charges they tack on to the room service,4.0
san diego minivacay with two toddlers,"my husband two daughters aged 2 and 3 arrived on a saturday there is a plaza directly below the hotel that has different food options httpwwwmiramesacomsorrentotowers so we had lunch there and then headed to the hotel checkin was easy and staff was friendly they gave us a two queen room on the third floor facing the courtyard facing the courtyard is your best bet as far as a view goes as the outer views are office buildings or the freeway the room is a basic marriott courtyard room nothing fancy very standard the lobby has a cafe and there is a pool jacuzzi area and courtyard to lounge outside
after checking in we headed to coronado and rented bikes at bikes  beyond great experience compared to our last trip to coronado last time we had parked near the coronado hotel and its was too crowded with tourist this time we went on the opposite side of coronado where it seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists after renting our bikes we went around all of coronado and it was so much fun for all of us 
i had done some research on places to go and one big attraction was balboa park but when we drove by we decided to pass on it and go back to liberty station where we had been to last time we love liberty station very familykidfriendly with a great park httplibertystationcomsliderparkrecreation and the corette diner httpwwwcohnrestaurantscommenurestaurantscorvettediner which is always so much fun for our kids its a completely decked out 50s diner with a turquoise corvette big beehive hairdos singing dancing games etc

perfect location,"our stay in this hotel was good stuff is friendly rooms are clean quiet except for the dogs barking in the hallways sometimes the bed is extremely comfortable i enjoyed that food is overpriced you only get one shampoo conditioner etc in the room for two people i dont get thatbut we asked for some extras and that was no problem no shower gel though only some weird soap bar with a hole in the middle 
i would appreciate more hangers in the closet for our clothes the sliding door to the bathroom is a bad idea its loud and doesnt give you much privacy also if you turn the light on in the bathroom it also automatically turns the light in the room which is not great when you dont want to wake up everybody when you go to use the bathroom during the night
the coffee in the room is terrible and we always got just one creamer for two people
the size of our room king superior was just fine for me im european so im used to it  
parking is a little bit pricey and it can take some time for you to get your car because they have it parked in a garage that is not in the hotel
location is perfect
overall it was good not great not bad",3.0

a fab stay at the muse,stayed at the muse with my husband and two children 21  18 the hotel was fantastic very chic welcoming and friendly we had two beautiful rooms linked through a small private lobby both rooms were very clean stylish and the beds where to die for wide soft and very comfortable complimentary tea and coffee was very welcome in the morning and the complementary wine each evening was a good way to wind down after shopping  sight seeing before hitting the nightlife an excellent location for times square 5th avenue the rockefeller centre empire state building and much more the staff were very helpful this is a super hotel to stay in and we would definitely stay here again,5.0
nice location and good value,we stayed here before new years hotel is in a great location around the corner from michigan ave our room was clean and nicely appointed but a bit small the only small downside was that the windows are thin so even though we were in the 30th floor we could hear street noise at night the bathroom also needs to be updated along the baseboards the paint and wallpaper were peeling back hotel rate was low though so this was a solid value,4.0

very nice and clean hotel,we just got back from a one week stay in fabulous nyc we arrived about an hour early to our hotel and irene front desk was so helpful in finding us a room before our check in time since the hotel is in the flower district it was always a treat to walk out in the morning and seesmell all the beautiful flowers it was a bit noisy we were on the 9th floor but we turned on the coolerfan at night and slept through all the street noise hotel very convenient to subway and bus route purchase a metro cardcan be used for both subway and bus we rode bus most of the time just to experience the city highly recommend staying at this hotel for the reasonably price you get a helpful staff modern and spotless room and convenience to all city sights,5.0

worth the expense an oasis in the middle of new york city,"just stayed at this fabulous hotel the staff  service were friendly  extremely helpful without being intrusive they all seem to enjoy their job and are proud of their hotel whilst we were checking in another guest was having problems with a financial institution and the front desk staff were going out of their way to assist in ensuring that the guests problem was being fixed without fuss
the rooms are great lovely to find your bed turned back when you return after night out not to mention chocolates as well as a weather forecast for the next day with temperatures in both f  c those of us not from the usa use celsius  really cant quite grasp the temperatures when in fahrenheit the rooms are not large but in new york space is at a premium 
the complimentary breakfasts were a great start to the day plenty of choices healthy as well as muffins  pastries to have someone toast your bagel for you  then bring it to your table was just lovely
the complimentary wine  cheese in the afternoon 3 hours was delightful to recharge your batteries before going out to explore ny at night or see a show
being able to make yourself a coffee or tea endless varieties and nibble on fresh cakespastries  biscuits at any time was fabulous
the entire library theme is a winner it adds to the uniqueness of the hotel as well as setting a mood of serenity  relaxation away from the hustle  bustle of new york

loved heartbreak,"barnoldswick lancs england 
 we went in july this year and stayed at the heartbreak for two weeks and it was absolutley fantastic i loved everything about it our room was big and very comfortable we had two televisions one in your bedroom elvis films on all day and sirius elvis radio the staff were very helpfull and the desk clerks were dressed in black and it was down at the end of lonely street
graceland is just across the roadand you can go up to see elvis grave every morning from 730 till 830 you can catch the sun tour bus down into memphis through the day which comes every hour and the hotel shuttle bus at night which you book at the desk and drops you off near beale st
we didnt have a problem with the hotel apart from the fact that the jungle room bar could be a bit bigger all in all we really enjoyed our stay at heartbreak hotel and all the staff were really helpfull and friendly we would go back tomorrow if we could we are starting to save up for our next trip and we will be going to heartbreak hotel first time i have ever been to the usa and it was my dream come true absolutley brilliant",4.0
honey they shrunk the hotel,"the doubletree is a nice enough hotel  just everything in it is smaller compared to most of the other nyc hotels i have stayed at small rooms hallways and elevators a total of 3 of which service 46 floors
i go to nyc on weekends about six times a year on average and often stay downtown at the millenium hilton which is supersized compared to the doubtletree downtown and usually in the same price range 
despite a good location i cant say i will go out of my way to stay there again in addition to the small room the sink had some major cracks and the door between our room and the next did not fully close or lock other than the inside latch
i would stay there again if the price was right but there are better options in the hilton family",3.0

gaps in service,"we utilized our marriott points to stay at this hotel and found the service lacking continuity the front desk was helpful the folks at the resturant were nice and the food was very goodwhat bothered me the most was we were expecting a very important package which was shipped fedex and clearly signed for and recieved with a name on a specific date when we inquired about the package we were told it wasnt recieved we requested the tracking number from the shipper and retracked the package the following day needless to say the package was delivered the previous day but someone in loss prevention apparently was too lazy to look we readdressed this issue when were told the package was not delivered the previous day but was delivered latera clear falsehood then the person on the phone in loss prevention had a clear attitude if you make a mistake admitted it and move on but dont lie about the issuepoor poor service from the loss prevention group
the pool was dirty the maid service never left soap in the room and left trash on our floor the people had an attitudenot what i would expect from a marriott and we have stayed at marriotts throughout the world",2.0
great location but,ask for a room on the inside the cable car bells get to you after awhile also be sure you have lots of energy to get back to your hotel at the end of the day doesnt matter where you go you will have a steep incline to climb to get back to this hotel this where the three cable car lines come in handy all stopping in front of the hotel hotel is great for easy access to fishermans wharf union square and shopping on market st and ferry market 30 minutes to airport by cab 30 minutes to golden gate park by transit 30 minutes to sausalito by rental car,4.0

a delightful new nyc hotel,although i live just 12 miles from midtown manhattan occasionally i stay in the city because of business last week was one of those times i decided to try ink 48 in general i am a fan of kimpton hotels ink 48 is a truly wonderful hotel its fresh clean spacious and is most attractive and appealing the staff are extremely nice that goes a long way with me as well i stayed in a deluxe room there was a special rate on the 14th floor with a view of 11th ave looking east  it was simply fantastic one word about the hotels location  its a little off the beaten path but if you are reasonably fit you can easily walk from the hotel to time square in less than 10 minutes the subway is also just three long crosstown blocks away cabs are everywhere buses are just one block over over the years i have stayed in at least 25 nyc hotels ink 48 is now officially my favorite,5.0
very upscale  great hotel,i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for a family wedding that was in the hotel ballroom i thought the place was expertly maintained and the room was very clean and modern the bed was comfortable the bathroom was huge by comparison to most hotels the view of the hudson river was fantastic the catered food was very good overall an excellent experience  although the one strange thing i found was that the hotel lobby was on the 22nd floor of the building not a bad thing just odd,5.0
many more positives than negatives,"we stayed june 15 thru 17 arrived at 1pm we had already advised the hotel by phone a day earlier that we would appreciate early check in self parking garage for this hotel is easilly accessed on 41st street heading toward 10th ave by the way a parking attendant actually parks your car and asks you if you are staying at the hotel fee was just 25nite this is great for nyc parking believe me valet parking is double that rate the elevator up to ground level takes you to the luggagebot we did not use and easy self checkin computer terminals a bell services staff member helped us our room was readyand guided us on a brief tour of the hotel and the nuances of our room
 room small just what you have seen in pictures we have been charged double the 149 we paid for smaller rooms at luxury addresses yes  the liquid soap has a pine odor yes only a curtain seperates the bed area from the shower sink toilet area a minor issue for us as i am generally more odorproductive than my wifethere is a window which can be opened a small way and that helpsno tissue box fabulous for nyc hvac system cooled the room in minutes be warned to save  a sensor turns it off when you are not in the roomgood thing it works so quickly when you come back in bed was firm but we liked that this room  1736 hadbar none the best soundproofing of any room in any hotel in which we have ever stayed i know only too well how new york city can invade other hotel rooms and how other rooms can leak sound into yours we generally turn in earlyah relief
 hotel fourth floor terrace is just wonderful rest have a drink before going up to the room free computer terminals didnt try the restaurant staff there was very nice free continental breakfast is also on four and some inside lounges as well each floor has a small room dedicated to a coffeeicecold water soda machine these are very frequently used by guests and you can find them messy if more guests than staff have preceeded you
 area all of nyc is accessed by walking andor taxi this part is not the most happening zone in the cityyet it is as secure as any neighborhood however and i frequently walked between times square and the hotel 43rd st is a particularly good street to travel up or down when going to or from times square small shops etc and pedestrian friendly

a wonderful spot for many reasons,from the conversation prior to arriving had on the phone assisting us in choosing a room to the numerous conversations we had in person while there that helped us plan our trip around town this hotel definitely holds up it was very personable this hotel was superior our room was perfectly described very clean and bright and we enjoyed ourselves staying in this great spot we would definitely stay here again the nighttime bedside godiva chocolates and the plentiful fresh fruit salad for breakfast were a very nice option too,5.0
location cant be beat,the main reason why i booked this hotel was its location and it certainly did not disappoint you cant go wrong being literally next door to grand central and only 1015 minutes away from all major attractions not to mention the great food choices that wont break the bank found nearby on 3rd ave try the libretto pizzeria on 3rd and youll love the food as well as the homemade ny favorites cannoli and tiramisu were the best i had just a side note anyhow the hotel room itself was nothing special room was very small but the bathroom i found designed for a little child and not for adults so this was the worst thing about the room however i knew going in that manhattan hotels had tiny rooms so i wasnt expecting anything keep in mind that there is no way more than two people could be comfortable in one room so get two rooms if you are three or more in number hotel staff were friendly and attentive to all my questions and issues with the room tv reception is horrible and i complained about it but was told nothing can be done i assumed all the tall buildings cause reception problems so it didnt bother me much was out all day anyways i didnt appreciate all the nickel and diming they did with the costly wifi charges charges for using the hotel phone for toll free and even local charges or the final surprising charge that id never encountered before which was for luggage storage upon check out they charge per piece of luggage which i didnt appreciate but i figured that this is ny so was expecting to be ripped off here and there overall this was an excellent first time visit to nyc and we had a great time cant wait to go back again and will definitely stay at the hyatt each time i visit because again its location cant be beat by any other major nyc hotel in the area all of manhattan was right outside my doorstep and i loved it,4.0

perfect location  great staff,"i have just come to the end of a 9 night stay it was supposed to be 3 but we had to stay on due to hurricane sandy
the staff have been exceptionally helpful and accommodating given our circumstances i have have heard all sorts of horror stories from other stranded travellers this week and it appears we certainly struck lucky
the location of the hotel is perfect too just a short walk to time square and yet far enough to escape the noise 5th avenue is literally around the corner and grand central is just 5 minutes walk
i dont like recommending hotels as everyone has different expectations but the iroquois has exceeded mine this last week or so for so many reasons 
thank you team iroquois",5.0
great for families with kids only,"as usual the hyatt provided great customer service for whatever reason our room wasnt ready on time and they provided comps to make our wait tolerable the pools were incredibly small and in one single location which were filled with hundreds of small children in fact the entire hotel looked like disneyland with all the children swarming everywhere 
my bad for not reading trip advisor reports before booking here since i was looking for a quiet romantic getaway and this was not quiet",3.0
great hotel great staff great place to stay,"hotel was wonderful staff very helpful especially jacki the concierge

a must is to go to the fort worth stockyards easy to get to with bus great fun and if you can go and see a real rodeo with bull riding  awesome
we went in may time weather was very hot hotel was exactly as the pictures show rooms very spacious and well equipped housekeeping staff friendly and efficient the only gripe i have is the air conditioning was quite noisy

perfect hotel in great location,"me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and could not ask for more reception staff were very polite and friendly o arrival and gave us all relevant information including the free wifi code and a drinks token they also gave us the option of a two double or a king room which was nice we opted for the king room was was amazing
bed very comfortable bathroom was spotless tv was around 40 and gave you the usual american tv channels a free safe was very useful to store expensive items the room was refreshed every day without fail with fresh towels and didnt have to call reception once with any problems our toilet became blocked and we requested help as we were leaving the hotel one morning and they said they would get someone up to sort it which they did well before we got back that day
staff always acknowledged us each morning and night as we left and returned to the hotel the concierge lady was also extremely helpful with suggesting where to go to eat
this hotel is only 3 stops on the subway from times square which takes around 4 minutes theres a subway two blocks down which takes 2 minutes to walk to

mixed review,i booked my stay on hotwire my stay was determined by price and ratings i attended a workshop at another 4 star hotel nearby the posted rate for the other hotel was 130 avg per night i paid 99 per night plus 22 per night parking fee and 1095 per night internet connection which i was told is not wireless because the hotel is too old and the cost to install wireless in every room is prohibitive the other hotel didnt charge for parking or internet nor did a local 2 star hotel where one of the other attendees stayed also you could hear people using the toilet in adjacent rooms my bargain room overlooked the freeway which could be heard at all hours of the day and night i think it is time for some soundproofing on a positive note the staff is great the grounds are beautiful beds very comfortable and the food delicious,3.0
hotwire no deal at st francis,"lets not get issues mixed here the westin st francis is a wonderful property the problem is if you think you got a deal guess again
i stayed at the westin or two day on business i booked the room through hotwire as i usually do the problems started before i even got to the hotel i called the st francis to confirm my reservation a few days prior to my stay i was told at that point that all hotwire rooms were only the rooms that provided a full bed there is no way my wife and i would fit in a full bed so we had to pay 35 a night for the upgrade i have never had to add money to get a bed we could actually sleep in 
another detail that was conveniently left out is that the westin st francis charges 5130 a day for parking i am used to paying for parking as most hotels now charge you even though you are staying at their property and in most cases there is no other parking options they charge you for parking this however in my honest opinion is a complete rip off 
so take your great deal at the westin 125 a night now add the parking and the up charge for a bed large enough for two adults to actually sleep in another 8630 im not sure you tell me is it a great deal any more at 21130 a night",2.0

lovely little gem,"the nutshell is i really enjoyed my stay at petite auberge and id really recommend it
the hotel itself is a charming boutique hotel in french decor im not particularly a francophile but i enjoy what they were trying to do if anglophilia is more your thing then next door is the white swan inn their sister hotel done in english style i found the room to be spacious clean and well appointed the bed was very comfortable breakfast was continental with a heavy french slantthink croissantswhich is more my speed 
what really knocked my socks off was the service i booked a stay of several days on bookingcom but i had an knee injury landing me in emergency prior to my trip that cut short my visit to only one night even though the nofee cancellation deadline had already passed when i explained what happened to reception they bent over backwards to help not only did they waive the cancellation fee they worked with bookingcom to get the reservation updated i really appreciated that they were so helpful during a time that was otherwise so stressful very impressive i",5.0
walking distance to times square,we stayed at this hotel both before and after a tour of eastern usa and canada and found it to be the best hotel on the entire tour the rooms were both bright and well furnished and as quiet as a hotel on manhattan can be we were on floors 4 and 5 which both faced a side street with the red cross headquarters directly across the road a railway line passed right under the hotel and a regular low rumble could be heard although this was not enough to keep us awake may be louder on a lower floor as other reviewers have stated several fast clean and relatively in expensive breakfast stores across the road from 10th avenue it is an easy walk across 9th and 8th avenues to the 7th where times square is located,4.0
great location,very nice hotel bed was comfortable room was clean staff was very friendly and the hot breakfast was awesome my only complaint was the shower the water pressure was so high it actually hurt to take a shower it felt like sharp pins and needles were stabbing me while they cant do anything about the high water pressure they could certainly use adjustable shower heads to compensate other than that everything was wonderful and the location was great we walked everywhere the riverwalk and the river center mall were only a few blocks away as was the alamo you can park your car here parking is free but space is limited although they let you park a couple of blocks away in another lot all in all a great hotel,5.0
the cool room,this hotel is a good place to stay when youre flying out of phoenix in the summer the room is kept very cool front desk is always helpful and they provide the things you might forget they offer a breakfast in the morning but our flight was too early shuttles were on time and not a long wait in between the time you call from the airport to you get back to the hotel,4.0
good hotel for business meetings and golf,"good hotel to stay if your purpose of visit is to be in the hotel itself probably one of the few places that can hold so many people in one place some excellent restaurants and great staff 
the only negative is the long distance from almao riverwalk and downtown area 
comparatively nearer to airport though

the small in chinatown,i only stayed for one night before going to albany we arrived much earlier from the check in time but the receptionist by the name of alice was so great in trying to get the room for us to check in she was very helpful the location is excellent which is very close to chinatown soho and little italy the subway station is just few steps away,3.0
one thing kept it from being perfect,"a great hotel  located 2 blocks from penn station and within walking distance of times square nice comfortable rooms with adjustable beds extremely friendly staff and a nice but small cozy bar wifi service was decent as well
so what kept it from being perfect  i set my alarm for 530 am and awoke when it went off i started packing up and was about to get into the shower when i looked at my cell phone and realized it was actually 430 the hotel had failed to adjust the clocks to account for the end of daylight savings time the previous weekend
despite that i would still stay there again highly recommended",4.0
very nice hotel near phx airport,"this property is actually a motel design with access from a large outdoor courtyard the courtyard a large pool as will as multiple setting areas with orange trees and umbrella tablesbut be forewarned the interior officerestaurant and rooms are nonsmoking but the courtyard is not during our visit there were both cigarette and cigar smokers nearby which pretty well fouled the air in an otherwise delightful venue
our suite had a very comfortable bed seating refrigerator and microwave oven all clean and good working order most of the suites face the courtyard and are accessible by both elevators and stairs in addition the lobby and restaurant were attractive and comfortable the full complimentary breakfast provided a wide array of items to choose from and was very good",4.0

nice location for the ,yesterday april 4th 2005 i returned from a 3night stay at the harrington with a group of 5th graders including my daughter from south ga the hotel is old and some group members had problems getting enough heat however the accommodating staff gladly provided a space heater we had 5 in our large room with 4 double beds and a pullout sofa the bath was small and the tub would not drain properly however the staff quickly provided maintenance to unstop it every time given the location and the price i would stay there again even with the problems the staff were so nice and since we were travelling on foot or by metro the location was great i didnt eat at harrys but the blue plate diner offered a great breakfast buffet for those that enjoy that meal youll enjoy the location and the price if youre not looking for luxury and you want a good deal,2.0
corporate parent in trouble,"i desperately wanted to like this hotel i like old historic properties and hope to encourage others to stay in them 
this place does indeed have a grand lobby the bar in the lobby is an attractive clubby space but expect to drop 67 for a domestic longneck there really is no excuse for that anywhere although it has become commonplace 
the room was plenty big for one person and the bed and linens were comfortable there was a ceiling fan which was a nice touch
unfortunately said ceiling fan had not been serviced since its installation in 1985 and it creaked and moaned also the room had recently been painted and it smelled like it and the windows had been painted shut all of the foregoing was a recipe for a persistent headache
the final straw was the minibar minibars are a ripoff we all know this this one however set a new low for me there was a service charge of 15 percent on items from the minibar items which are already marked up considerably    items which you serve yourself thats just needless piling on and it makes me wonder how badly the parent company is in need of revenue",3.0
would take a lot to beat it,"we stayed here dec 5 to 9 2008and were a bit worried after reading earlier reviewswe arrived early and were checked in and asked to return for our room key at 3pm as stated no problemo
the room was immaculate as was the whole hotel the staff were very helpful and friendly and our corner room on the 43rd floor made our stay amazing the hotel was clean tidy and except slight works ongoing on the front door area the renovations are all complete there was no noise or dirt from the front door works and the back door is so grand that you dont really worry about it the turndown service and nightly weather forecast were a bonus in the room and it has the perfect location for a great stay in the big city1010",5.0
fantastic base for seeing new york,we booked this hotel based on its location as we wanted to be in the centre of all the action and it didnt disappoint the service was just what youd expect in a good hotel and everywhere was spotless and clean we would definitely recommend staying here to anyone coming to the big apple,5.0
was a great value when i stayed,i stayed here in 2004 and for about 140night including taxes i had been to nyc about 4 times that year and this was by far the best value i was attending a conference in times square and i had a leg injury so i needed someplace walking distance this hotel was much better than i expected for the price the room was large huge by nyc standards and very clean i realise things may have changed and we may have been lucky with our room and the rate was really awesome but this hotel would still be one id check rates at if i were looking for a room in nyc,4.0
first class,"i booked two nights at this hotel at an exceptionally good price through hot wire earlier this year
i ws rather concerned because of the reviews being posted
the hotel is beautful  friendly helpful staff every member  restaurant opened for the first night while we were there  lovely meal well priced
we were upgraded to a lovely room on 29th floor  as it was my husbands birthday we were treated to complimentary sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries on the first night and compliementary sparkling water and fruit and nut platter on the second night  well done westin
great location but as our booking stated new york helmsley there was a little confusion with the taxi driver as the hotel name is now the westin  but otherwise no problems at all  thank you",5.0
full of history  luxury,"my husband and i stayed here for 4 nights in august with friends of ours we were upgraded due to my friends hilton honors status to the executive club and were given a beautiful room on the 21st floor his status also provided us with many perks such as access to the lounge the lounge serves pastries cereals coffee tea juices cheese plate yogurts etc for breakfast  all complementary we never had to eat breakfast outside of the hotel during the day it also served brownies which were invented there cookies pop juices and served hors doeuvres every evening from 5pm7pm a fantastic perk 
the hotel is huge we typically are into smaller boutique hotels but this place is beautiful the lobby is the most stunning hotel lobby i have ever seen with the artwork tiffany chandeliers and beautiful ceiling its a gorgeous spot for a predinner drink there is a starbucks right in the hotel as well which is nice location is good steps from an el train stop the large macys is a block away and the hotel is also close walking distance to millenium park and the art institute 
everyone we encountered at the hotel was very helpful and made our stay fantastic we really loved the little history lesson that we learnt while the palmer house station on tv which gave us a ton of info on the hotel the palmers and chicago very interesting information 
overall a fantastic stay at a beautiful hotel we will be back",4.0
good location nice hotel,valet parking 2500 per day room was very nice and clean comfy beds trying to find the entrance to the hotel was a bit rough our ac went out in the middle of the night they gave us free parking in return ,4.0
great location beautiful room,we stayed only one night because we were in town for a fundraiser at the boston public library we wished we could have stayed longer the accomodations were terrific the room is beautifully designed and the bed and linens are exceptional the hotel is quiet the front desk staff is helpful and friendly and the location is perfect for a weekend in boston we would definitely return and plan to do so soon the next trip will include a visit to the seafood restaurant the description of the oyster sliders will definitely bring us back this hotel is for the money a better value than some of the comparable firstclass hotels because of the service and the room amenities,5.0
location,this location is hard to beat great hotel excellent service but beware of the concierge lounge i think everyone gets a pass in or at least it felt that way it was overcrowded and breakfast ends promptly at 930am  needless to say we didnt eat breakfast there as we couldnt even sit down room was a bit dark and the bathroom was very small with no pressure at all in the shower,4.0
perfect location for sox game,"no this is not an ultramodern hotel but the staff was great the rooms were neat and clean and for 138night on a friday night in boston to see the sox it was just right the subway is right outside the hotel and it takes 2 minutes to walk to the common we did not go to boston for the hotel and if that is what you want this hotel is not for you if you are there to enjoy boston and want an affordable place to stay i recommend it to you
also by calling i got a cheaper rate than hotelcom for breakfast i recommend the south st diner about a 15 minute walk worth every step and if theres a wait its worth it",4.0
i love the w,"thank god for fatima if it was not for her we would not have closed a 7 million deal week it all started when our corporate office had no meeting rooms so we were staying at the w and fatima under short notice was able to secure the best meeting place the w had to offer im forever in her debt

this hotel is cozy and charming and in a great location,i stayed here with my mother for a week for medical reasons the staff was polite and very helpful the food was very good and the beds were comfortable the indoor pool is great and the outdoor firepit is cozy and romantic the guys will also enjoy the outdoor tv the bar is fun and has good energy the hotel has a great location its close to the medical district downtown shopping fine dining and the airport its also close to the denver zoo and other sight seeing and is surrounded by a beautiful neibhborhood and park the cherry creek trail is great and right here as well the hotel even offers bikes if you didnt bring yours beautiful area with a bonus view of the mountains its a great value and i would definitely stay here again on future trips,5.0
simplyexceptional,there truly is no finer hotel to stay in in the entire detroit area this hotel in fact ranks amongst the nicest ive stayed in in the entire united states everyone here must have taken the four seasons school of customer service and it shows there was some concern at checkin and check out lines are a little longer than expected no level of detail has been overlooked in the design of the hotel everything is modern new fresh and up to date things are done with a modern flair but it is comfortable and welcoming the rooms are wonderful complimentary wireless internet firm but comfortable beds flat screen tvs both in the room and the bathroom fluffy bathrobes ipod docking machines and more the bathrooms have dual sinks a separate toilet area and gigantic walk in showers the rooms are about 500 square feet and are very spacious and comfortable the design is very modern and up to date and as the hotel itself is relatively new things look great the casino of course is the main focus of the hotel and sadly since it allows smoking it can be a bit of a turn off for those of us who dont enjoy second hand smoke the restaurants are okay but extremely overpriced we ate at bourbon steak and while it was a good meal the bill came to 250 and thats with just only one glass of wine each wolfgang puck for breakfast was a big disappointment and again priced as if you were eating at the ritz in paris also watch out for the valet parking  they put a scratch on our vehicle and it was never resolved the room rates are always quite high so dont expect any bargains here this hotel is for people who can shell out the dough or those who are big players and somehow get their rooms at reduced rates or fully comped if youve got the dough and you want a luxurious atmostphere you have arrived,5.0
great location good value,second stay in 9 mos free parking clean rooms and bathrooms so close to fishermans wharf walgreens safeway and trader joes within walking distance rooms a little dated and in need of some bathroom upgrades but the cleanliness and friendly staff make up for it,5.0
nice but almost too big for its own good,"let me start by saying that i really enjoyed my stay at the omni dallas the only negatives stem from it being a large hotel and at the moment very trendy so it is very busy and crowded as a omni select guest member i bypass the front desk checkin so i cannot comment on that experience
the rooms are very spacious and great floor to ceiling windows looking out to the dallas skyline as a new hotel everything is clean and up to date the room could have better controls for the lighting since there is a lot of it i think there were at least 6 lamps in the room also electronic controls for the shades would have been a nice touch the hotel has several options for restaurants and the owners box sports bar was great
i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone but just know that it is likely to have a bit of a hectic feel to the main areas of the hotel",4.0
nice hotel in midtown,my 15yearold daughter and i spent five days in manhattan and stayed at the affinia shelburne its a nice property with comfortable rooms and trendy decor our room had a microwave and mini fridge which were useful conveniences affinia proudly offers a pick your pillow option and my daughter loved her choice which allowed her to listen to music while falling asleep service was mixed  there was no stopper for the tub and it took three phone calls over an hour before one was delivered also some items in the minibar were outofdate we enjoyed the hotel overall,4.0
good location great price,"just returned from a stay at the surfer during the last week of april for 3 nights its a great hotel for the price  you cant beat the location we had a room on the 3rd floor with an ocean view there are some rooms that dont face the ocean but we resquested an ocean view room when we made our reservations  got exactly what we requested we kept the curtins open almost the whole time just admiring the view from our room we also kept the sliding door half open with the screen shut  never experienced any problems with noise just the sound of the waves in the ocean the room was very clean the bed was comfortable their rooms are nicely remodeled  very modern looking the only complaint that i did have was that the shower is made for shorter people i have read this issue in a previous post so i knew what to expect im 57  i did have to bend down a bit when washing my hair but it really wasnt a major problem the surfer was like a 10 min drive from everything i would totally recommend this hotel for someone who is looking for a hotel on the ocean and close to all tourist attractions in san diego 
thanks surfer for making our trip to san diego very memorable",4.0
really liked it esp vs chicago intercontinental,"i was in chicago staying at the intercontinental on michigan avenue and had to change hotels abruptly when the intercon lost my reservation for the last night of a conference i was attending my secretary got me a standard room last minute at the fairmont i was skeptical and in a bad mood anyway via intercon experience but was very pleasantly surprised
for 329 corp rate i received a 33rd floor suite with a view of lake michigan the room was spotless and homeycool  think west elm decor the lobby and reception area are cool and peaceful with a wine bar right in the center even got a chance to try the hotel restaurant  aria  which was excellent except for clueless service bringing everything at oncewhat but the food is quite good and left me wanting to try it again  warm nanlike bread with dipping sauces to start gratis a nice touch
beds v comfortable better that heavenly westin beds wellstocked minibar and welcome basket full of goodies extra charge  even the chamber service was friendly  my evening service person actually came in to do the turndown and chatted with me for a couple of seconds unobtrusively which i appreciated traveling alone
i though the fairmont would be a stodgy choice but i am a fan and convert would definitely stay here again great service calmingsoothing atmosphere everythings buttoned down  first class",5.0
great lobby,"wonderful location fun lobby bar and friendly service

the hotel and the staff were amazingly welcoming,"the hotel stay was wonderfulwe had a girls weekend in san antonio with friends we hadnt seen in years the staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly 
several of the employees made us feel right at home one in particular i believe his name was marques he was exceptionally friendly helpful and professional with all that we needed the front guest services went over and beyond to accomodate to our need i have stayed at hotels where the valet is not so friendly not the case at all  they were great and fast 
overall  excellent hotel to stay at if youre visiting the san antonio area 
thank you la cantera for making our girls weekend a blast",5.0
good value great location,"four of us two couples stayed for four nights in two double rooms we found the hotel to be in a great location walking distance to many of the sights youll want to see and a subway station right next door for those further away
all staff were very helpful particularly concierge and our rooms were great small but clean we found the rooms to be very quiet 1743  1744 they faced inwards to another section of the hotel so no view but no noise from the streets outside given that all you do there is sleep and shower they were perfectly ok
given that we paid not much more than 500 per person for return flight from the uk and 4 nights stay ebookers we felt that we had great value for money if you want a posh hotel expect to pay posh prices
carnegie deli across the road and the deli that is attached to the hotel cant remember the name sorry both did fab breakfasts the deli on the opposite corner to the hotel was great for late night cocktails and food
all in all a great hotel but judging from other reviews it probably depends on the room you have the only thing that would have improved our stay would have been tea  coffee making faciltiies in the room",4.0
perfect hotel in a perfect location,the rooms at this hotel are simply beautiful the bed was one of the most comfortable i have ever stayed in other than my own and the decor is beautiful everything from the huge flat screen tv king size bed cute bathroom spacious closet and storage space was perfect the heating was also great in the cool weather i guess my only tiny gripes were the pressure of the shower head being really weak and the lack of bar fridge although there was an ice facility close by the location was fantastic being only a 5 minute walk from macys union square and 10 minutes from the westfield shopping mall i would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone considering a stay in san francisco,5.0
really nice stay,had an absolutely wonderful stay here the hotel is one step ahead of the flash of some of the party hotels the vibe is very understated cool this hotel doesnt need to inyourface about it we had a lovely corner room king on the 12th with a great view especially from the giant bathtub staff was very helpful and relaxed in a good way would definitely return here,5.0
avoidable but for the location,"to start with the good thingsin fact perhaps the only good thingthe location of this hotel is really nice on the union square right near the macys and otehr shops etc
regarding the other stuff the hotel is really run down the rooms and lobby badly need a renivationthe staff a lot of training
go there if you must only for the location but for all else look elsewhere",2.0
personal item that was left in room  no where to be found,i left a white night shirt on the bed in my hotel room after i checked out i stopped back in  called  talked to the housekeeping staff so i could pick it up and no one seems to knows anything about my night shirt and did not even seem to care,1.0
no bed bugs in my room on oct 2225 2011,we just flew home to chicago after a few days in boston we stayed at the harborside and had a wonderful visit the hotel is in the middle of everything trolleys harbor and quincy market is one half block away the north end is within walking distance the location of this hotel can not be beat this hotel is clean and wonderful and guess whati flew home without one single bed bug bite dont beleive all you read on this site this hotel is wonderful and highly recommeded,4.0
brilliant hotel,"this was our first trip to nywe stayed 7 nights at the fairfield bb and had a great time
the breakfast was good and with lots of choice
the rooms were small for ny but spotless and had everything you needed  the shower was more like a wetroom  it was great
we didnt have much of a view from our room  we were on the 9th floor i think it went up to around 18 floors but i did request a high room when booking after reading these reviews
but we soon got used to it and after all you dont spend that much time in your room
the staff were all so polite and helpful nothing was any trouble at all for them
outside the hotel on the street is awash with flower shops its a lovely area
i would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone who wanted to stay in ny",5.0
nice hotel for airport convenience,my husband and i flew to arizona for a long weekend to visit the grand canyon and other parks in the northern part of the state we arrived in phoenix rather late and had a very early flight on the return so wanted to stay near the airport on either end of the trip we selected the fairfield because of its proximity to the airport the complimentary shuttle and of course trip advisor reviews we were not disappointed the hotel staff were all very nice jake and jenny at the front desk and mark and tim driving the shuttle the room and the property were clean the bed was very comfortable and overall it was very quiet however if youre looking for a lively atmosphere then tempe home of arizona state university is only 3 miles away there were also plenty of restaurants there as well unfortunately if you dont have a car as we didnt at the end of our trip since wed turned it back in your choices are limited which could be a negative however the shuttle drivers even though its not advertised and i doubt you could demand this service were kind enough to drive us the three miles which worked out great in short for a clean quiet and convenient place thats close to sky harbor international i would recommend this hotel,5.0
very pleased with the kimberly,"my cousin and i stayed 6 nights at the kimberly in a 1 bedroom on the 26th floor the beds were wonderful the best ive found in new york  including the plaza the furniture was a bit worn but fine the room was very quiet and the balcony was an added plus
the door staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a good location near the subway and many great restaurants
i will definately stay at the kimberly again",5.0
loved our stay at days inn at graceland,this was our 2nd visit to memphis and stayed at the days inn for 2 weeks previously we had stayed at the heartbreak hotel we thought the days inn was much nicer and a more pleasant experience breakfast is included and is cereals fruit juice tea and coffee toast muffins etc and freshly made waffles it is all selfservice which is very good the location is excellent if you are an elvis fan and the pool area was always very clean and tidy the staff are very helpful the only criticism we could make is that our room was too close to the ice vending machine and can be quite noisy early in the morning there was a door which closes off the machine but it was usually left open it is only nit picking really because in general the whole days inn at graceland experience has been a great one,4.0
halloween party,i had an amazing time at the halloween party at the w the environment is very clean sleak modern and airy there were djs on the 1st floor and 2nd vip floor i highly recommend the vip section if possible free drinks all night long and a tad less crowded for more dancing room alyson the manager of the bar and restaurant service took very good care of my friends and i she made sure that our drinks were always full and that we were having a good time throughout the evening there are fun multicolored lights that light up the bar the bar staff were all dressed up in costumes and really seemed to be enjoying themselves i will definitely return to this party next year,5.0
last minute reservation at the hilton garden inn,we were lucky to get a reservation in sa our trip was a spure of the moment trip to san antonio to visit seaworld during spring break need i say more this hotel is located close to the sa airport downtown and the riverwalk was 10 minutes away while seaworld was 25 minutes there was road construction surrounding the hotel area but it did not cause much problem the property was well maintained while the swimming pool was small in size this property ended up being booked a few days before our arrival the staff was friendly and helpful,4.0
prepare to be indulged,super happy with this hotel reasonably priced and perks like free happy hour cookies and milk and breakfast buffet cant wait to come back,5.0
we will come again,"this was our first time in new york  all our previous city breaks have been to historical european cities  and whilst we were excited at the prospect there was some nervousness too would we enjoy such a densley packed modern city the omens werent great when our taxi from the airport was pulled over by the police for jumping a red light just after we arrived on manhattan island
it was a real relief therefore to arrive in the lobby of the affinia dumont to be greeted by friendly and helpful staff who immediately put us at ease weve got a great room for you they told us  and we agree we were in an lshaped 21st floor junior studio with great views of the chrysler building and across the east river the room was spacious with a decent bathroom and a small kitchen with a huge fridge although by no means the fanciest or newest hotel room weve ever stayed in the room was very comfortable and we couldnt fault the cleanliness of the room or hotel generally id have to say that the room was great value
the location is great we walked almost everywhere but its no problem to catch the subway or get a cab although theres no hotel restaurant the barking dog on the ground floor of the building offered good quality reasonably priced food and friendly service echoing that in the hotel itself having a gym and spa helped us to relax after each hectic days sightseeing and our time in new york flew by too quickly in fact  well just have to visit again and when we do well stay at the affinia dumont",5.0
charming relaxing getaway,we just spent two wonderful days at the andrews hotel in san francisco the building is historic and so is the elevator but that just added to its charm the gracious touches of fresh flowers in our room complimentary chocolates and glass of wine each night were very welcome and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the onsite restaurant fino serves delicious food and it was very nice to be able to dine there after a busy day of sightseeing we opted for the smallest room so did not expect much space but we enjoyed our time there tremendously location is terrific just two blocks from union square and the cable car line,5.0
great hotel,have just spent 3 nights at the waldorf astoria we have nothing but praise for this great hotel we stayed in a minisuite on the 8th floor and although we didnt really get a view the room itself was fantastic the bed was very very comfortable and the two bathrooms were both perfect on booking in the receptionist noticed i had requested foam pillows due to a fgeather allergy and said she would get our room defeathered we had only just arrived at the room when the foam pillows arrived closely followed by a maid to sort out the room fantastic service having read some past reviews on this site we were also apprehensive about staying at the waldorf astoria but felt we should give it a go and are very glad we did,5.0
not bad for the money  take away the uninvited crawlers and it would rate a 5 star,first i want to say that for the 49 discount these rooms were great except for the univited crawlers we did see cockroaches on the wall and i alerted the desk they sent two different people up within 3 min of my call to spray the room i live in florida and know it is very hard to keep the insects out everything else was 5 star treatment from the front desk girl to the server in the lounge florencia who all treated us with great smiles and friendly atmospheres the maids did a good job during our 2 day stay and i have stayed there in the mid 2000 and will stay there again but will carry my own roach spray with me clean up the bugs and it would be great the pool needs to be heated in the winter also beautiful decor for the christmas season i wanted to take the decorator home with me,5.0
we loved it ,after reading the reviews of the boston park plaza i was very much doubting myself for making reservations there not only for myself but for five other people  i was pleasantly surprised that our rooms were very clean the staff were great and very helpful it is also a perfect location and the 200 menu at mccormicks restaurant cant be beat we also had a formal dinner there that was wonderful the next time i go to boston i will stay there again ,4.0
happy in seattle,"great value in this hotel
not in the downtown core but able to walk everywhere

average dirty room good location,we chose the sheraton for the location we did pay more for a deluxe king and while the view was fantastic the room was dirty and very dated with no fridge or safe real shame i wouldnt recommend this hotel,3.0
really average,"we a couple stayed there 2 nights and i wont repeat it 
the pros  
1 price 85tax a night
2 comfy bed and the room looks clean towels and sheets too
3 free parking  ask to park in the nearby parking lot saves a lot of trouble other people described here about parking
4 the location is very comfortable if youre mainly planning to visit hollywood
and for the cons  
1 the breakfast its coffe and a donut i dont consider this breakfast
2 the wifi internet was awful slow and hardly working for me its an important utility in a hotel
3 the blankets were old and i had a disturbing feeling of fleas though never seen any
4 the room itself was very dark  lighting not sufficient
if youre planning to travel and not stay in the room a lot  this is a decent one to consider",3.0
great location on an ugly street,"this is the perfect hotel if you are in town to go to broadway shows you can easily walk the 8 or 10 blocks to most theatres however this stretch of 40th street backs on the main bus terminal  not attractive and the streets nearby are always elbow to elbow crowded you might want to stay uptown or downtown if you want to leave your hotel go for a leisurely stroll then stop at a nice outdoor cafe for a coffee and croissant
the hotel itself is wonderful the rooms are nice good beds good bathrooms the windows open very clean the staff is very friendly helpful and knowledgeable my only complaint is the minibar  always a problem for hotels the solution in this case is one of those youtouchit youve boughtit models which leaves no room to put your own cold drinks or food too bad when the minibar selection is not great and there is a dean and deluca one block away we prefer the solution of hotels like ottawas westin  take out all their things and just post a note saying we thought you might like this fridge for your stuff",5.0
great first impression,we stayed for 3 nights this past week basing our decision only on the reviews weve read the moderne was exactly what we hoped it would be clean walking distance to times square broadway restaurants and the staff was very accommodating yes the rooms are small but thats part of the modernes charm it has about 40 rooms total and our room was nicely decorated as was the coffee room on the second floor which we really enjoyed yes the elevator is somewhat slow and hot a few times we walked the stairs for exercise the mattress was extra comfortable and we detected no noise at night a great place to call home after long days of seeing the sites we were so glad we stayed there,5.0
on the road to texas,we stayed at this hotel on monday night 21 may this place had courteous staff upon arrival and our departure very easy to get to and reenter at i40 room was very clean pet friendly and had a quiet ac system which you received a great night without hearing a window unit running all night breakfast was great we couldnt say enough when we are in the area again we would definitely stay here,5.0
great facilities good location great service ok gym and breakfast,"stayed there with sister and friend and had a very enjoyable stay
within a 10minute run from the smithsonian museums along which i ran for a total of 5 miles or so  from hotel to lincoln memorial and back
service is awesome at the marriott  as usual room spacious and clean as usual i was received with fruits and chose a bottle of fizzy wine
metro at footsteps plenty of taxis quite centric i would choose it again
gym was all right  usual lifefitness equipment but felt a bit too dark  pool a bit small and crowded
breakfast was just ok  nothing that great compared to that in other marriott hotels  limited selection of cereals omelets a bit too oily etc",5.0
door lock issue for little ones,this is an add on to my previous review we never noticed this but our daughter and family spent two nights there with our grandsons ages 7 and 5 there are no deadlocks on the doors to prevent little ones from exiting the room since the two sleeping areas are on opposite ends of the suite separated by a bathroom and if parents are in sound sleep from a day of exploring they might not hear if an early riser child should get inquisitive and head out since our 5 year old is on the sprectrum this created some anxiety about sleeping arrangements the resort hotel is outstanding but this glitch could be fixed easily and without a lot of cost,5.0
modern clean and a great location,"i stayed at the att conference center hotel and loved it from the valet service at checkin to the impeccably clean and modernly furnished guest rooms my experience at this hotel rivaled that of other much higherpriced hotels in downtown austin 
 the valetbellman swarmed my car upon arrival they were polite  helpful though a little slow getting the bags to my room slow i can handle if its accompanied by a genuine smile they seemed to enjoy their jobs immensely quite a difference from the typical valetbellman
 the room was beautiful tiny bathroom but it offered a large enough separate sink area always hugely convenient when multiple people stay in a room as compensation the room smelled a little musty upon checkin but that was nothing a travel candle couldnt fix 
 the conference facilities were neat clean modern and within walking distance from several great restaurantsnightlife options
 overall my stay at the conference center hotel was fantastic i will definitely consider this hotel when staying in austin in the future",4.0
be a select guest and reep the benefits,"i took my 18 year old niece for a 3 day weekend trip to new york city for her high school graduation ive been to new york 6 times within the last couple of years and like to try different hotels in manhattan after realizing the prices were definitely much higher than my last visit i decided to try hotwire i landed the omni for 237 per night other hotels i was considering were in the 300 range so i was pleased with the rate and hotel chosen i stayed at the omni about 8 years ago and truly loved the location we were treated very well by the front desk personnel upon checkin we arrived at 10 am and still one of our rooms was ready the rooms are relatively small but nicely appointed my stay at the new york palace last year included a room twice the size of the omnis the bed was comfortable with top of the line linens the bathroom was functional and elegant with a marble shower and granite countertop we had unimpressive views from both rooms i overlooked st patricks cathedral from my room at the palace the housekeeping staff was efficient and helpful the most important point to share about the omni is their select guest program i signed up for this free program after making my reservation i received a select guest card in the mail with various coupons that included room upgrades and 50 my next omni weekend stay as a select guest member you receive complimentary morning drinks delivered to your room a newspaper of your choosing late checkout until 5 pm when available and preferences noted of your pillow type and floor youd like to be on in all omni hotels i was thrilled with these perks i enjoyed freshly squeezed orange juice and hot tea each morning and the new york times i also utilized the late checkout since our flight didnt leave until 7 pm most importantly ive noticed that when other travelers book their rooms through a discounter like hotwire or priceline when they checkin they are treated like hobos on holiday as i said our front desk person treated us kindly and respectfully she was a great introduction to new york for my niece who had never visited this fine city before 
overall we had a wonderful time the hotel is centrally located the rooms are nice and clean ive stayed at the palace the benjamin and the waldorf astoria the palace is my favorite but the omni still ranks high in my book if you decide to stay at the omni you must be a select guest",4.0
great place with a family,"heyif your looking for an good family place to stay i recommend the dana inn and marinait was the perfect place if you are going to seaworld it is close by and they have a shuttle even if you take a taxi it would only cost you 4 bucks the rooms were small and the washroom was okhowever the restaurant was very friendly and room service was wonderful an added feature is the poolthey have games during the day and blow toys all the time we took our own however we did not need them i have stayed at the paradise point resort near seaworld in mission bay and the dana inn beats them hands down they were friendlier and accommodating the water in the pool is warm as wellthey really make it a point to win your kids over that is a plus i dont think my kids notices the roomafter going to seaworld and playing at the pool all afternoon and evening they pass out triedit allowed my wife and i to have a vacation beer incidentally you can see the seaworld fireworks located near the resorts dock starts at 950pm it is cool everybody standing around looking and going oooooooooo and ahhhhhhh funny kids had a blast check it out once 
down the street is another amusement part as well i think it is call baymont plus the ocean you gotta check it out no they did not pay me this is one parent to another",4.0
great location what i expected,"one of the great things about tripadvisor reviews is that you are fully prepared for the good and the bad at any property you might reserve that was certainly the case for our three night stay at the westin st francis overall i would say that we got a very good value for our money and had a great stay at the st francis we especially liked the location
we booked online and got their 3 nights for the price of 2 special so we paid about 500 for three nights in a historic building room with 2 double beds overlooking union square from a high floor i chose the historic wing as my son and i have a fear of heights and worried we wouldnt do well on the glass elevator you use to go to the tower rooms the tradeoff is that even on a high floor you can hear the noise from union square and powell st through the windows not terrible unless you are a light sleeper
the room wasnt large but was fine for the four of us the bathroom is updated with marble and a double shower which was great one complaint is that westin tries to save money on amenities by only providing the basics shampoo conditioner soap you must call their service hotline for any others eg i needed a shower cap they are prompt with that service but i found it a bit surprising we also had an issue with the feather and down bedding allergies but they quickly fixed that for us
as others here have said dont open the fridge unless you want to be charged for something we did bought a bottle of wine and had to have the charges removed at check out easy to do
i would also agree with others that there is little dresser space for unpacking maybe four narrow drawers i didnt bother unpacking anywhere on the trip but it would have been a pain if i had wanted to
we had no problem with check in or out since we arrived late and departed early it did however look horrendous during late afternoon someone on the elevator told us it took him an hour to check in
we didnt use the gym or the oak room we did enjoy coffee and bagelsmuffins in the lobby area which opened at 6 am great when your body is still on east coast time loved the elegance of the old hotel great location for touring we even rented a hertz rental car for a day of touring right from the hertz desk in the hotel the agent was extremely helpful and efficient
all in all a great stay and yes the candid photos on this website tell the story",4.0
not what i expected,not 4 star in my opinion lobby impressive thats about it room decor was below average hotel did not have correct room accomodation but not sure if that was bookitcoms fault or the hotels requested 2 beds in one bedroom suite and a pull out sofa as we were 3 women that wanted to sleep separately got one bed the pull out and a roll away which was like sleeping in a tree location good as 3 blocks to subway and near penn station kitchenette had no toaster and an awful coffee maker so thank goodness dunkin donuts was just downstairs outside the door refrigerator is nice to have and should always be in rooms probably would not stay here again,3.0
great location,my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights during the festival of lights we checked in on friday a little before 300 pm and our room was ready the rooms are a lot bigger than what other people are saying in their reviews we had a king sized bed with too die for sheets and pillows and the mattress is just heaven is the hotel older yes but thats the charm in this hotel elevators were not a problem at all they are small but we never had to wait the staff is very eager to please their guests sully the doorman is a wonderful man just wanted to add that as my husband and i enjoyed talking with him i would recommend this to anybody who enjoys ambience and charm thank you whitehall hotel,5.0
great location,great location clean hotel we thoroughly enjoyed our stay no complaints or problems at all with the hotel when back in chicago will definitely plan on staying there again,5.0
nice hotel great amenities close to everything,"the eventi is the second kimpton hotel that we have stayed at the first was 70 park ave which is a slightly different style of hotel but no less friendly with great amenities
the room we stayed in at the eventi was the king with city view the washroom was a nice marble floored and tiled room the only issue was that the floor was quite slippery due to the design of the shower which is open to the rest of the bathroom water tends to get pretty much all over the bathroom if you are a messy showerer
the rooms were clean beds were well appointed with nice linens double curtains individual climate control a little noisy and the lighting was variable and well done
otherwise everything worked and there were nice italian bath products provided
all the basic amenities were provided including robes and a generous closet safe and fridge there is nowhere other than the bed and one chair to sit so this definitely isnt a room to be hanging out in but new york is not a place to hang out in your hotel room anyway
the location at 6th ave and 35th street is a few blocks from penn station and not far from any subway or bus shopping is limited around the area but since its manhattan nothing is very far away
the foodparc restaurant on the ground floor is very handy and has a great variety of different types of cuisine at reasonable prices there are lots of other food options in the area the in hotel spanish barbasque restaurant is excellent as well one of the best in hotel restaurants that we have experienced there was a summer prix fixe menu on when we were there in august which was excellent value some may find the prices high but the food was delicious and well prepared with decent portion sizes the staff was very friendly and helpful with our 2 year old too
we didnt use the business centre or the fitness centre so we cant attest to the amenities there
i would definitely recommend the kimpton to anyone especially those looking for a premium hotel in nyc",5.0
royalty at the palace,"my fiancee and i stayed at the new york palace to celebreate a birthday as it was our first stay in new york and a special occasion
we chose the palace based on location reviews and recommendations
we were not disappointed
for anyone travelling from the uk wanting to be treated special feel safe be close to most major attractions i can only recommend this hotel
upon checking in we requested a view overlooking the cathedral the ever efficient staff gave us a room on the 27th floor overlooking the cathedral one word amazing
the location of this hotel is great one avenue off 5th shopping heaven a 10 minute walk to central park rockefeller centre times square just a few minutes further the rooms are clean large and very well furnished the staff are very helpful and the surroundings the courtyard very inviting
if we come back to new york we will definitely be staying here again",5.0
pricey for what you get,this was our first visit to san fran and we decided to take a shot in the dark and stay at the hotel carlton first off the rooms are very small and no ac the windows do open for some downtown fresh air limited towels noisy streets and lots of sirens there was a laundry shoot right by room could always here something being thrown down it heavy doors so you hear lots of slamming if your looking for a quick breaky but average quality then eat there they charge 3440 a night for offsite parking and you have to call the front desk and order your vehicle and wait 3045 minutes for it to arrive oh and you have to tip the guy each time the elevators are very small and take a lot of time to arrive as well i suggest you use the stairs there are no ameneties at this hotel either no pool or fitness area the front end staff were nice and helpful and the hotel was pet friendly but i probably wouldnt stay here again,2.0
worst place in nyc to stay,"the location is wonderful and unfortunately that is best thing i can say about this hotel the extremely small rooms with even smaller bathrooms is not one i can recommend to anyone for the price the staff did try to accommodate us but the skunk like smell out of order acheating units and 4 power outages this hotel was just horrible i experienced staff at the front desk yelling at patrons for booking rooms through 3rd parties such as expedia priceline etc due to acheating unit going out in our room the staff offered to raise the windows comp our dinner give us a 10 discount bring a fan to our room which too stopped working and comp our last nights stay in the hotel per the manger which did not happen this hotel is over priced  at best a 12 hotel if you want location stay here because that is the only plus to staying at this hotel 
never recommend this hotel to my friends",1.0
room shabby chic  didnt live up to its reputation for either quality or service,my partner and i stayed at the carlyle for a friends wedding that was taking place in the hotel whilst the ground floor of the hotel is undoubtedly impressive the rarefied or snooty atmosphere leaves one feeling slightly uncomfortable our room on the 8th floor could best be described as shabby chic it had obviously once been a very nice room but was in dire need of a makeover we ventured into the hotel bar to find that there was a 50 dollar cover charge just to sit down not including drinks  needless to say we didnt stay even if i were extremely wealthy i dont think i would welcome being ripped off in this way however my friends wedding was perfect in every way from the ceremony to the service and food so the carlyle redeemed itself there however i wouldnt be keen to return and certainly wouldnt recommend it reading through some of the other recent reviews it is clear that many others have had a similar experience and i cant help thinking that there are a number of issues that the carlyles management needs to address as a matter of urgency if the hotel is to hang on to its reputation,2.0
great hotel in great location,stayed at this hotel while in nyc hotel is clean cosy and welcoming with a classic decor staff are also welcoming and friendly the location is also hard to beat being close to broadway the subway and reasonably close to central park price seemed reasonable for the location but the room was a bit smaller than what we would have liked couple  6 yr old and with three suitcases we had to place one on the floor near the door since there was no where else to put it prices for food and services seemed a little steep not sure how they compare with other hotels in the city but we found a diner only a few doors down which had good food at good prices hotel would suit a couple who only intend to use it as a base and dont intend spending much time there but being in nyc thats not hard to do a positive experience overall,4.0
great location amazing service older hotel,took my fiancee to chicago for her birthday we wanted to stay on michigan ave so we grabbed a room at the intercontinental the staff was amazing marcus at the front desk got us a room on the 22nd floor with an incredible view of michigan ave keenan helped us with our bags twice and was very nice i had mentioned to both he and marcus that it was my fiancees birthday and when we got back to the room from our night out they had left birthday cake really made the visit extra special the room itself is nice if a bit older and in need of a little tlc weve also stayed at the main competitor to the intercontinental the conrad hilton down the street the room was probably nicer at the conrad but you cant beat the service level that we had at the intercontinental be aware that valet parking only option that i saw is 57 a night,4.0
clean and lots of food options nearby,"my wife and i stayed two nights at this comfort inn location before i left i asked for a fridge in the room but i guess my note was not received or understood the clerk told me that it was 10 and wheeled out a fridge from the front desk area i had to wheel it to the elevator and plug it in myself not a complaint but little things like this matter to me and make all the difference to a stay for me there was mold in the fridge but i didnt want to lug it all the way down again and i was tired we cleaned it best we could the rooms were comfortable and very clean we got a king sized bed the breakfast is the usual waffles cereals coffee eggs bacon bagels toast and was always a good stock of items front desk staff were nice
the hallways are loud like most hotels people can be quite loud and inconsiderate sometimes especially late at night
it is 5 minutes from fort harrison state park walmart can be seen from the room window along with many restaurants applebees bob evans marcos pizza steak and shake there was a pool in the hotel that looked clean but small looked sized for children high speed internet is free and quite fast",4.0
cute cozy clean  classy,my boyfriend and i stayed here for 2 nights in june 2012 and it was a great experience the hotel staff was extremely friendly the lobby was clean and comfortable and even though the room was on the smaller side we had a king bed and great street views the hotel is walking distance to some awesome restaurants many historical sites and a 7 cab ride to kenmore square  fenway the front desk offered us great restaurant  night life suggestions and helped us in planning our sightseeing compared to some other hotels in the back bay area the price was just right allinall i give this hotel 45 out of 5,5.0
smooth no surprises,ive stayed here several times for meetingsbusiness each time its been a smooth nosuprise stay checkineasy roommarriott standard decorclean wired internet free if you are in their rewards program room servicefast reliable reasonably priced location is greatliterally connected to the metro if you are looking for a nodrama experience look no further,4.0
service off,"unlike the other reviewers on this site did not have a great experience with the service called for toothpaste and soap and they only brought the soap called the next day for a razor for my wife and after 45 minutes of waiting i finally went and got it myself it was sitting at the front desk with my room number on it waiting
when checking out they would not give me a receipt because they said i had booked through travelocitywhich i hadnt and anyway why cant i still have a receipt receptionist was just cold and unhelpful about it  left a bad taste in the mouth
for the rest the room was all right but nothing special  the desk and chair were a bit nicer than the ones at the motel 6 but everything else was the same air conditioner in particular was a crummy against the wall unit instead of a central thermostat and i do not think that our filter had been changed recently 
did i mention that the hotel is really expensive like almost twice the price of everything else in the area youre paying for the extra service  the other hotels in the area dont have a front desk bellman who will bring you stuff  a bit nicer room and room service but since my service was no good my room was not really nicer and i never had room service i did not see the value
still good looking property and you can certainly do worse no bugs no loud noises etc but you can also do better",2.0
great location good service,we stayed 3 nights at the intercontinental century city over new years eve 20112012 and we are super satisfied with everything the service was great and the location being close to west hollywood beverly hills and the coast is the best place to stay the hotel should however consider upgrading the finish of some public areas and some rooms if they want to claim their fame,5.0
great hotel in new york theater district,we saw good reviews for this hotel in nyc and booked it for 3 nights prior to a cruise the hotel is older but in very good shape our room was quite roomy by new york standards there was round the clock coffee tea and hot chocolate in the lobby which was handy the breakfast was a fairly standard hampton inn breakfast but it did have waffles eggs and a meat each morning it was only a block from broadway and 7 blocks from central park walking to the park or shows was very easy the price which while high for a hampton inn was very competitive for this quality of a hotel in the area,4.0
great place to call home,i have been traveling to houston for business each week since april each time im there i stay at the renaissance the staff there couldnt be better it only took a few times for them to know my name the personalized attention is great but the hotel itself is spectacular i would recommend it to anyone,5.0
mostly loved it but beds were a problem,we knew it was going to be an older resort hotel so our expectations were set correctly what we didnt expect was how perfect the location is for a quiet familyfriendly relaxation vacation on one side is the private beach and marina and on the other is the bay and a strip of public park that we didnt want to leave we sat in the lawn chairs we brought and took our time with our little barbecue the weather was perfect on july 2nd and 3rd shelter island is a gem with a beautiful strip of public park space for boat and people watching along the bay even though it was very popular on the july 4th weekend as expected it was only on the 4th that it got crazy because locals stake out space early to watch the fireworks at 9pm we got the package that included premium views and a breakfast and free parking the room is the size of a balcony stateroom on a cruise ship except the bathroom is larger the balcony is small and hadnt been cleaned neither of these facts bothered us because we had a gorgeous view and a wonderful location room 348 the staff was very friendly and helpful with very few exceptions the free breakfast is actually very nice but limited options include 2 eggs a fritatta a waffle pancakes and one other thing i think we sat in the restaurant with a gorgeous view of the marina they serve you coffee and leave the carafe spouse and i both ordered two eggs and bacon he chose potatoes while i chose fruit thats it you dont get toast or juice or anything else we didnt care it was presented very nicely strangely my eggs ordered over easy were really underdone i had to send them back and ask for over medium when the plate was returned the whites were still a little liquidy and the second time the bacon was overdone if you like over easy i would order over hard it was tasty enough though the fruit bowl was lovely strawberries grapes melon and fresh pineapple the parking gate is a little sticky you need to keep the card in the slot a second and then it opens we would return but maybe ask for a newer room with a better bed or maybe return on july 4th and ask for a bay view room to watch the fireworks without having to stake a space in the park early in the morning we didnt use the pool though it was nice and not overcrowded the pool and spa close at 10pm keeping things quiet i tried the spa but left after a family let their boy pee in it they were speaking spanish and assumed i didnt understand them thats why i hate public spasthe behavior of one or two people who ruin it for everyone we got massages and they were good and included the steam room and a shower restaurants in point loma are only a few miles away one of four miguels mexican is right off the island great chips and the perfect real mexican margaritasjust tequila lime juice and rocks overall we had a lovely time,4.0
too small of rooms for the price,"i stayed at the marriott downtown recently and i had booked the reservations a month in advance for adjoining rooms when me and my family went to check in at about 3pm the rooms werent available and we had to wait an hour for the rooms to be prepared
when we finally got our rooms i was very disappointed there is no mini bar no refrigerator and you barely have enough room to walk in the rooms
i dont think i would stay at this hotel again",2.0
nice hotel but the train woooooo wooooo,"my wife and i have just returned from 4 days at the omni hotel in san diego i really liked the hotel the staff were great the pool is really nice
however i cannot believe no one has mentioned in their reviews the trains every morning 4am ish except one we were woken up by the train leaving the huge marshalling yards just behind the hotel it would pull up outside the hotel where the lights were on red and blow its horn about 5 or 6 times i know i am a light sleeper but you could hear it 4 blocks away
it was annoying but not the end of the world just thought i should mention it",4.0
what a city hotel should be,the conrad has everything a city hotel should have great location in downtown chicago a roof top bar and lounge wonderful room and the most comfortable beds and very pleasant service you couldnt ask for more,5.0
wonderful experience,participated in a conference at the hotel and we had a wonderful experience the professionalism of management and staff with all the requests for conference room and setup rooms for all the attendees breakfast arrangements shuttle service and quick responses on assistance when needed was very impressive rooms were very clean comfortable and quiet hotel was centrally located which also made it very convenient for shopping and dining would definitely come back to stay here when visiting phoenix,5.0
not the greatest,the exterior of his motel is faded pink and totally turns you off the inside of the rooms though large are incredibly shabby the carpets are torn the rooms smell like stale cigarette smoke theres broken furniture chest and dressers missing drawers the showers in the rooms are pretty much a trickle does not accept credit cards the clientele consists of people who actually live at the motel during the course of the night there was the smell of strong india food permeating the hall and the rooms the owners live in the motel as well and people yelling throughout the night will never stay there again,2.0
the talbott was a treat,great staff quiet and well appointed room walking distance from great shopping,5.0
a great place to stay in chicago,my wife and i along with our son recently spent five nights at this terrific hotel we stayed in a onebedroom suite that included a kitchen with microwave and small refrigerator the room was in excellent shape and was meticulously maintained the breakfast included was also very well done it was a buffet that included eggs with side dishes bagels bread fresh fruit oatmeal and waffles this was not your typical continental breakfast but more than anything else was the attitude of the staff everyone was extremely friendly and helpful even the maid i cannot say enough good things about this place the manager should be commended for running such a tight ship there is no question that we will stay here again when we return to chicago,5.0
fine unless you need the to do something for you,"first of all you need to appreciate that for many weeks in the year a motel 6 can charge over 200 a night and generate over 90 occupany in washington this means that even an embassy suites can have a rather cavalier attitude toward customer service
it took four requests to have the staff replace a defective television i got the distinct impression that the staff and management felt they were doing me a favor by responding however slowly and grudgingly my hilton honors gold status and an 250 nightly rate didnt seem to matter
the hotel shows wear and the staff while friendly dont have much of an incentive to solve a problem at the first opportunity i hate it when management reps dont respond to calls and requests for a visit just hoe you dont have a problem",2.0
nice inside and short walk to convention center but needs soundproofing,"appears to be newly remodeled clean indoor pool divided into 3 lap lanes and a hot tub one cup coffee maker in room a few blocks to convention center close to monorail staff was very helpful in getting me packages that i had shipped there 
big con for me paper thin walls and a lot of noise can be heard from the hallway the elevator has a loud ding when it comes to a floor although i was not right near the elevators i could hear it i have to give it 3 stars because of the noise
other cons elevator can be slow at times really need some new pillows for the bedsnot much stuffing in them at all",3.0
great all around place to stay,we really enjoyed our 4 day stay here hot breakfast was great plus they have a social hour at dinnertime that provides free beer  wine plus snacks twice it was a full meal  this was a bonus for us as we were on a tight budget and this was a medical trip the staff was friendly and offered suggestions to our questions the shuttle was convenient and the drivers friendly the property was clean room was nice and clean and we slept great on the bed the pool looked inviting although we didnt have a chance to use it my husband and i will definitely be back next year for my followup its also right next door to kroger which makes it convenient if you do not have a car all in all we both agreed this was a great value for the price,4.0
comfortable lodging,i stayed 3 nights and was impressed with their ability to handle 400 women for 2 meals a day  good choices for lunch and breakfast buffets we didnt spend lots of time in the rooom but it did manage to accomodate 2 women getting ready for a conference day at same time i was happy to have access to the floor 15 hh lounge  quiet and well stocked for free snacks and breakfasts it became our groups after hours meeting place concierge helpful with transport would stay again,4.0
best airport parking deal,we traveled to boston for vacation this year as we always do when we travel we end up parking our car at one of the airport parking lots however this year we learned of a different way of doing it from a neighbor we stayed the night before at the renaissance hotel on airport blvd and did the park and fly you stay at least one night at the hotel and you get 7 days of covered parking for free it is then 1100 a day after that its a beautiful hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpful we also ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was awesome our waiter sergio was very professional and a great representative and spokesperson for the hotel when it comes to traveling i believe this might be one of the best deals in town,5.0
good location and reasonably priced  but watch out for the noise,i stayed here for a couple of nights on a business trip in early october it is a great location for visiting the financial district within walking distance of wall street and broadway and reasonably priced compared with other hotels in this part of new york the rooms are modern if a tad functional and basic they are on the small side too with only a shower no bath and a very small double bed the hotel has good facilities however  complimentary wifi throughout the hotel and free pcsprinters in the lounge and a nice touch in the bedrooms with an ipod docking station built into the radio its greatest advantage though is its proximity to the 911 memorial site most rooms have a view of the emerging tower and memorial pools and there is a great restaurant on the 20th floor overlooking the whole site this great advantage is also the hotels biggest downside however  ground zero is basically a huge building site and the pile drivers start early in the morning and dont finish until late at night so a reasonably priced hotel if you dont mind the noise,3.0
good value especially considering the location,this hotel is excellently located very close to times square and broadway and very well priced for this location although the rooms were a bit small this is normal for midprice new york hotels and they were clean well equipped and recently decorated the staff were friendly and helpful our only problem was a mistake with the bill but this was honourably and quickly sorted out once we were back in the uk and were able to feed back our original booking information to avoid this ask for an email confirmation of your rate when booking and take a copy of the email with you then ensure that the correct rate is shown on your registration card for all nights of your stay however this problem apart we would thoroughly recommend the washington jefferson,4.0
very nice w fantastic spa,"very nice property with all amenities you would expect several restaurants pools gift shops starbucks spa  golf i personally ate in the lobby bar crooked branch and it was very good food the breakfast and dinner i had at the ciblo moon was also great food i heard from others with my group that the steak restaurant on the golf course was very slow to get the food out there are many pools and water slides the adult only pool is not far from the path to the water slides and the kiddie pool so it is not very quiet it was nice service around the pool they will open the umbrellas for you and bring food and drink some of my group did the segway tour and loved it i visited the spa and that has its own pool which was the best big and quite has floats hot top nice chairs and you can order food and drink i would recommend the spa we had treatments and everything was 1st class fitness center located both in the hotel and spa so you have several options as well as walking trails i did not use the golf course but it looks very nice rooms are nice but not over the top no slippers no balcony in all rooms some do have balconies and just one robe over all it was a very nice long weekend it is much nicer during the week vs the weekend as the other reviews mention there are crowds at the pools during the weekend there was actually a line to get a wrist band to get into the pool area on saturday where there was not on thursday or friday i would have given it a 5 star but the proximity to town or the riverwalk was not close so a complementary shuttle would have been nice
overall property and service is what you would expect from a hotel of this price range",4.0
excellent hotel close to fishermans wharf,"this was the third time we have stayed at the tuscan inn and each time it has been excellent
the staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help you we had a double room with 2 queen beds although the rooms are not huge our room was still easily big enough for 2 adults and a child plus 3 weeks of holiday gear 
the hotel is close to fishermans wharf 5 minutes walk max from the seafront but not so close that it gets the noise the base of the cable car line is one block away and there is a safeways one block away as well
at 5 pm every day the hotel holds an informal reception where you can have a couple of glasses of wine and normally some food brought in from the italian restaurant next door after spending an exhausting day walking the hills of sf this is a great way to unwind before heading off for a meal in our case we used the adjacent italian restaurantif you are staying at the tuscan inn you get 10 off your bill
theyve got an underground garage at the tuscan inn but we didnt use it as we there is no need for a car in sf the cable cars provide an easy way of getting around sf but the costs can soon mount up if you are using them continually we walked much of the time and took in the views",5.0
enjoyed our stay at the millenium,my husband and i stayed at the millenium broadway june 1618 this hotel is in a great location right across the street from virgils barbecue and next to the hudson theater this is the 3rd time i have stayed at this hotel and each time it gets better the staff at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay a wonder experience we had a room on the 50th floor with a great view of times square everyone was extremely helpful and courteous and helped make our vacation great they recommended an italian restaurant called carmines  excellent food with huge portions the room was newly renovated with comfortable beds beautiful headboard huge windows new carpet great tv and yes there is a coffee maker in the room the next time we are in new york city we will definitely stay at the millenium again,5.0
make sure you have plenty of time,i was at the resort for 3 days and 2 nights for a seminar check in and check out take forever likewise with retrieving your bags from the bell cap and your car from the valet remember that if you have a plane to catch i ate at their upscale restaurant francescos as well as the grill downstairs both places were overpriced  especially francescos service was great  food was mediocre all hat no cattle if you are not in to golf go to another resort la cantera is pretty and the views are nice but thats it they dont have a clue as to how to make a guest feel as though hes getting what hes paying for,2.0
the most obnoxious barman ever,"stayed here for a week starting on 28th jan 2012 first evening at the bar there was a very lovely oriental lady very professional and courteous 
second evening she was replaced by a 50ish year old american guy right from the start i found his attitude disturbing he was clearly friendly with another guest who was already seated at the bar and was trading opinions about all sorts of subjects
i hate people who ask me whether the beer is cold was one statement he made shortly after a person came up and asked him that question i hate it when people ask me are you open  was another statement he made he then made the bold statement i hate british people im british a fact that he must have figured out when i ordered my beer i hate the british they never leave a tip and dont tell me they dont know that tipping is customary in the us they always pretend that they dont know they know alright theyre just cheap and dumb
i sat there with my mouth open thinking what the hell 
i few minutes later a couple of old ladies came and sat at the bar the barman saw them but needed to move away from the bar for a couple of minutes and told them hed be right back 
true to his word he was back in a couple of minutes but decided to serve his friend from earlier before serving the 2 old ladies he then went off to run another errand by the time he came back the ladies had gone
they returned later with the duty manager theyd clearly complained and the duty manager bought them a couple of glassed of red wine on the house 
just a few minutes later the barman noticed a couple of very large ladies heading towards the bar area immediately he said in a loud voice but not loud enough that the ladies would hear holy guacamole thank god we havent got an all you can eat buffet here to which his friend at the bar responded and they then went on to make disparaging remarks about the overweight ladies of course when he went over there to get their drinks orders he was all smiles but back at the bar he continued expressing his opinions about large ladies
ive been around a bit stayed at hotels all over the world but this was the worst barman ive ever come across i complained to the hotel but they just asked me to email more senior people which i will get around to doing eventually i eventually left the bar i also made it a point to mark on the bill a tip for a grand amount of 000",1.0
great value for the money,located in an upandcoming neighborhood the hotel is a quick cab bus or train ride to downtown you cannot find a better price anywhere elseand the staff was great although hotel rooms were a bit sparse they were very clean,4.0
overall a great place to stay,"i really loved this hotel the staff was more than friendly and the room was awesome
the only thing that ruined it was that the restaurant had a limited menu i wish we were informed ahead of time because we specifically wanted a hotel w a restaurant and knew what we wanted to order the limited menu food was awful 
other than that the room was very clean and cozy hotel parking was high but the hotel rate on a weekend made it worth it
i specifically picked this hotel because of the reviews and it was great",5.0
quirky throwback to another era but a really good option,strange place felt like a retreat hotel from the 1960s however the location is good rooms are great and service was fine it was a good option for us given that it was cheaper than the other riverwalk options and as a tourist you definitely want to be close to riverwalk the pool was slightly green,4.0
a good no frills pit stop,"all in all i suppose this will sound like a bad review but this hotel served its purpose well room with 2 queen beds near lax for under 100 with free parking and breakfast all of our requirements were met satisfactorily if you are looking for 4 star quality and service you wont get it but you arent paying for it either
we normally stay in marriott hotels but tried to make our recent trip to los angeles a little more affordable on this particular night before catching an flight out of lax the next morning 
the service was pleasant but definitely not the go out of your way to make it the best stay ever that we have grown accustomed to 
the room was surprisingly clean and spacious it was right on a busy street so quietness is not top of the list though with the air conditioner running all night you miss most of it 
breakfast left a lot to be desired unless all you are looking for is a bagel and an orange pure continental carbs for a quick getem out the door also not much room to sit down and eat we had to go sit outside which was ok the hotel is attached to a dennys but i dont know if there were vouchers to eat there instead they werent offered to us next time i would definitely skip the provided meal and hit dennys
if an inexpensiveno frills pit stop is what your looking for then this is a great place",3.0
best priced high end property in san diego,i vacation in san diego a few times a year and you cant beat this new sleek resortstyle property  its biggest draw includes its spacious modern design and its resort pool area thats right on the waterfront as well as the vast parklike area that surrounds the hotel  yet you are also so close to the shopping and restaurants of the gaslamp district another great thing i found is the pricevalue compared to other quality properties in san diego it just cant be beat,5.0
historic hotel with modern ammenities,i have stayed at many drury inns and with this trip being our first time to san antonio i welcomed a familiar hotel chain the ambieous of the hotel is suburb the staff is very friendly and the extremely helpful the room was decorated above standard and we slept so comfortly we nearly missed breakfast the first morning all the happenings within the riverwalk are within walking distance the valet parking was top notch and we will definately be staying here again next summer,5.0
beautifully historic,i spent one night in august at the oxford hotel in downtown denver co and i wished id had several more there the place is beautifully historic but the rooms are beautifully updated so there is none of the mustiness you might expect in an old hotel the bathrooms especially were nice the hotel also had a nice attached restaurant and is in a lovely part of denver just a block from my favorite destination the tattered cover bookshop,5.0
totally relaxing,i couldnt have asked for a better time to celebrate my husbands birthday we enjoyed the spa gourmet restaurant and wonderful service at the rancho bernardo inn the staff went the extra mile to ensure our stay was exceptional i am disabled and while the grounds are beautiful with rolling hills and wonderful plantings the staff made it possible for me to get around with ease and comfort at my beck and call totally refreshed and ready to meet lifes new challenges we will return hopefully often thank you so much for the best time,5.0
outstanding highly recommended,stayed a total of four days suite was very clean as was the rest of the hotel staff was wonderful and friendly only thing i can complain about is a lack of parking sometimes during the evening since the hotel is located in a shoppingdining area other than that i would return,5.0
its simply not clean great locationdismal service unclean hotel that could be much better,"arrived on friday afternoon for a medical conference our rate for four people in a room two teens and two adults was 499nt astronomical rate and they would not budge from it since this hotel was where the seminar was held we really didnt have a choice we will never again attend a conference at this hotel
check in was smooth we were ushered to room 1602 directly across from the bank of elevators as it turned out the room was huge and the elevator noise was not a serious problem
the room itself was in poor condition on the bedskirt on the bed nearest to the door there was a huge liquid stain of some sort disgusting every single lampshade had holes and was bent crooked like a brawl had taken place at some point
the carpeting was ancient ancient to the point of pulling away from the walls and cobwebs and dust and food had settled into the cracks i was very happy i had brought my slippers
 this is the kind of hotel that makes you cringe everytime you look into a nook or cranny behind the tv set thick with dust and crumbs
most unfortunate was the fact that this room was connected to other rooms on both sides by reedthin doors forget about getting a decent nights sleep if you have a neighbor who likes to watch television we were kept up until 3am on a saturday night by our neighbors television
the grand hyatt touts their econcierge service they have a link to it on their website however i sent two different requests to their econcierge before we arrived and both requests were completely ignored the first request was for dinner reservations ignored the second request was for extra towels in our rooman option that their econcierge offers that request was also ignored we had to phone housekeeping for the extra towels every single day
we were promised a coffee machine and a fridge in our room we had to phone housekeeping for those as well the maid refused to stock the coffee maker with coffee and cups after the first day 
forget about getting any glasses in the room we were drinking out of our hands from the bathroom tap while brushing our teeth
if you would like 2 wine glasses delivered to your room the charge is 6
we knew in advance thanks to tripadvisor that the room service charges were astronomical so we stocked up on juices and water and bagels from the shops down at grand central terminal one morning we did order breakfast one ham and cheese omelette was 24 with no toast and no juice or coffee the omelette was dry as dust and cold 24 for an omelette astounding
 one small box of fruit loops was 10 with no toast and no juice 6 mini pancakes from the kids menu was perhaps the best value i would strongly advise people to order from the kids menu to avoid being absolutely gouged by the laughable prices and make sure to order a pitcher of ice water its about the only thing that is free in the hotel
all of these complaints aside the thing that really bothered me the most was the filthy condition of the glass in the lobby there are several revolving glass doors and a couple of regular glass doors and every single one of them is literally covered in slime no matter what time of day or night the lobby was thick with the finger goo and faceprints and palmprints of the hundreds of people who go in and out all day and all night its absolutely disgusting one employee armed with a bottle of windex and some paper towels could solve this problem by cleaning the doors once an hour but this hotel doesnt seem to care about germs or cleanliness
try it for yourself and you will see that this is a hotel that simply does not care 
if you want to get gougedstay here",2.0
thank you from az,"we checked in early and was greeted with smiles and kisses for my dog i was hesitant when i saw where our room was elevator and ice machine i would ask for the same room over and over we never heard the ice machine or the elevator and talk about convienient my dog got to know otisthe elevator real well everytime we went to the
 lobby we were greeted by name the room was huge and spotless i have to say the hidden gem is the bar inside the bistro daisy we were greeted by martin the bartender who was priceless we mentioned how good it smelled in there and he went and told the chef  two minutes later gabriel the chef had sent out a small plate of potatoes for us to sample killer i ordered stuffed salmon on a whim i hate fish omg i have never tasted anthing so good in my life i could not stop eating my husband had regular salmon and i heard him mew with every bite he took gabriel came out to meet us and we enjoyed him and martin more than you can imagine wonderful people you have there",5.0
well be back,free shuttle from the airport room was spacious very clean would stay here again,4.0
i am not complaining but,this is not a gripe but i have 4 issues with regards to my stay first i booked thru hotwire and i got a ridiculously low rate which is really great for me but for the first time i felt like a second class guest here why first the room they gave us was nice at first glance but upon closer scrutiny there were minor problems like the shower head was defective the toilet had a leak and the knob in one of the lampshades was missing second the location was right in front of the tracks so if you are a light sleeper then better bring some earplugs third we stayed for 6 days and upon checking in i requested for a fridge since i had my family with me they told me that they will bring it to my room as soon as it becomes available it never came although the rooms next to us received theirs even if i came earlier i know what i am talking about because i saw the refrigerators out side the rooms near us lastly there were 3 occassions that i had to call the cleaning ladies attention with regards to our daily supply of toiletries which she forgot i have been using hotwire for the past couple of years and never has this happened to me i was always treated as if i was a regular paying guest anyway as ive said this is not a complaint just an observation if someone asks me if i would like to stay again at the hilton gaslamp i would definitely say yes the location is fantastic the front desk staff were friendly and the ambiance was terrific ive stayed in 45 stars hotel in san diego since 2003 and i have to admit this is the best the issues i raised did not really bother us for we were always out enjoying san diego lastly will i still patronize hotwire you bet i will i hope this becomes a wake up call for both hotwire and the hilton,4.0
great location,we had a room with a partial ocean view but when we stepped out into our balcony it was a full ocean view this hotel is within walking distance from pikes market space needle and the emp museum we would stay here again,5.0
wont go back there,"it was my first visit to dallas and sheraton by galleria was the first sheraton that i stayed in in the usa
unfortunately that was terrible there are so many hidden payments 10 for parking  12 for the wifi access added that their bath towels were smelling so bad furthermore the waster sink and the bath flood

great location,we have just returned from 12 days in nyc staying at the affinia manhattan in a one bedroom suite we were very fortunate to have an upper floor with a brilliant wrap around balcony that gave us views up to central park and down to the hudson river we sat on our balcony and watched the 4th july fireworks the room was a good size with a kitchenettethe only negative was the bathroom was very compact the room was efficiently maintained the staff at the concierge desk maureen and norva were knowledgeable and very helpful they helped us on a number of occasions with answers to such questions as what bus do i get to go to battery park and where do i get it to helping with our online checkin and obtaining our boarding passes the location of the hotel is one of its biggest assets right opposite penn station and madison square garden on 7th ave it is only a couple of blocks to most of the sitesmacys empire state building times square and broadway there are plenty of fast food establishments around penn station but we found a great cafe down 31st street cafe r which had salads and freshly cooked asian food there is also a dunkin doughnuts and subway right next door the affinia manhattan is great value for money in a good central location,5.0
nice hotel not a great location,had a good stay big clean room good water pressure pleasant and helpful staff cleaning staff were very courteous and did a great job bed was big and comfy too decent breakfast included our only problem is that it is far away from anything youd really want a car if you were staying here we figured out the bus system and there is a bus terminal down the road but it takes a long time to get anywhere cab ride back from downtown at the end of the day ran about 30 which really cut into our budget,4.0
comfortable stay,"our third trip to ny and our first stay at la quinta one of the main reasons we decided to book here was the location  a central location near to penn station this was also to our advantage as we flew into newark and decided to transfer by train  as you leave the station on 7th its just a two block walk to the hotel
the hotel is in the korean district and is surrounded by restaurants and watering holes  the esb is directly behind the hotel and macys is a two minute walk away there is also a subway 100 yards away  a perfect location
the reception area is small and has a few loungers next to the lift and the small shop  it makes it feel like a friendly place to stay and indeed the staff were extremely friendly and helpful they also have safety deposit boxes in reception which we took full advantage of
the room itself was basic  a double bed tv coffee machine hair dryer etc the bathroom appeared to have been updated recently and all in all was a comfortable place to sleep  which after all is all you need in a hotel in nyc the only time we spent there was when we were sleeping
the 14th floor houses the bar which was small but cosy an excellent idea as you look out at the esb as youre supping away the bar is like a conservatory so you have excellent views particularly at night
breakfast was also included an impressive assortment of cereal bagels doughnuts fruit and youghurts a member of staff was always available to replenish the food so that it was always available this was great as you could fill up before walking it all off
there is also a fitness suite there but i didnt use it so cant comment in the basement area there is also an internet room
a very nice hotel that i will consider again when i return to nyc",4.0
great historic boutique hotel,a really nice boutique hotel which is located right the heart of the dallas historic district the rooms are very well appointed while the prices remain reasonable i strongly recommend if you need to stay downtown dallas great staff also finally we held a conference there and the overall servicepackage was quite good the food was also very good,5.0
garish design but good hotel,"on a recent business trip this hotel was recommended to me by my corporate travel agent i generally love kimpton properties so i was excited to stay there
checkin was great the staff was wonderful the lobby and restaurant are very coolbut i thought that the design in the room was just over the top and wild its retro its modern its all over the place
but the room was comfortable wifi was free breakfast in the morning was quick and good a complimentary new york times was on the door
nice enough hotelbut make sure you get a good price",4.0
charming staff at this freindly hotel in great central location,we took our son for his 8th birthday and you couldnt get a better location right next to times square evereyone at the mela was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble great recommendations for breakfast  red flame diner   pizza at johns but dont go with their suggestion of aj maxwells for steak unless you dont mind paying 50 bucks each for a sirloin,4.0
luxury with a bit of noise,we stayed at the casablanca for one night friends of ours were visiting and had made all the arrangements we found the hotel very clean the room was lovely and the staff was extremely friendly the only issue was the noise granted in nyc you are going to get noise particularly with the proximity to times square it was not inexpensive so i would just warn out of town guests that it is smack dab in the theatre district and you will hear sirens all night long bring ear plugs,4.0
a great place to stay,"my daughter two granddaughters and i stayed at this location on friday nov 4th while in denver to see the lion king at the nearby denver center for the performing arts we had gotten lost on the way there and were tired and frazzled upon arrival those feelings evaporated as soon as we walked in to the lobby where we were greeted by an extremely friendly young man who checked us in promptly and professionally and made us feel very welcome 
the rooms were beautiful and comfortable i think maybe they have been redone since the last time i stayed
the brerakfast was bountiful and tasty and more importantly was presented very nicely in an immaculately kept area 
the morning desk attendant very graciously allowed us to leave our vehicle in the parking garage for several hours after our check out so that we would not need to find parking for the show another nice added touch
we stay at residence inns across the country as often as we can and lately some have not been up to par this one more than makes up for those what a great place",5.0
comfortable stay in times square  no frills no issues,"my boyfriend and i stayed at the sofitel in new york for two nights during our weekend trip to hang out with friends watch broadway  abt shows and enjoy some great restaurants all in all the trip was enjoyable and relaxing and our stay at the sofitel  while not a standout  does not detract from the trip either
we were given a room right by the elevator bank on the 10th floor of the hotel but we didnt experience any noise issues the vibe in the hotel is definitely luxury though not quite like the pierre or peninsula hotels all the hotel attendants and front desk reps we interacted with were helpful perhaps even eager to help while i have no specific anecdotes to relay in my mind and experience that can be a positive there are certainly no aspects to our stay that were suboptimal  i would stay at the sofitel again particularly if our plans included more broadway shows and gallivanting around the city the sofitel is located right off fifth avenue equidistant to the bdfv and 456 making it easy to traipse around manhattan if you know however that your plans dont require you to be near times square or lincoln center or the general midtown area the sofitel isnt necessarily the best option the bowery and crosby hotels downtown are better options for visitors who will be frequenting that area sofitel however i think is a reliable option for midtown",4.0
perfect in every way,"we were spending only one night in new york so i did a lot of online research to pick one that sounded nice comfortable was convenient to the theater district but not right in it and which fit our budget of 300 or less based on the reviews here i chose sofitel and booked the cheapest room at 259 what a great deal  you get so much for what you pay particularly in new york
as recommended i mentioned it was our anniversary online not thinking anything would come of it but when we arrived the extremely friendly and helpful gabrielle told us we had been given a deluxe room on the 27th floor we had a view of chrysler building and the puerto rican day parade preparations the next morning and there was sparking wine waiting for us with a thoughtful note
the bed indeed was the most comfortable ive ever slept in the room was big by any standards and the bathroom was enormous by any standards both a shower and a tub with a detachable showerhead large sink with a large lit mirror mood lighting a candle and fresh flowers lots of closet space with all different kinds of hooks the blackout curtains were great as we were up late the night before the room was totally dark 
best of all was the soundproofing not only could we not hear any street noise particularly the preparation for the puerto rican day parade replete with bands and djs blaring full blast as we discovered when we went outside but most incredible of all when i opened the door i discovered someone vacuuming right outside our door i couldnt even hear the vacuum when i was on the other side of the door
left our bags with the concierge as we explored the city on sunday no charge to leave the bags also when we checked in the night before gabrielle asked if we wanted late checkout staff was extremely helpful we were sad to go and wished we could have stayed longer
only criticisms bathrobes were a bit scratchy big deal and the air conditioning was finicky either too cold or too warm even if you only adjusted it one notch",5.0
jumping the shark,"jumping the shark
my stay at the fs in boston was a great letdown lets talk about the good features it still retains a very good concierge service and tideness of rooms and common areas but
when i checked in i was given a room right in front of the ac vent which apart from being really noisy it cooled the room too much and it made entering the room a bit of a challenge as servicing the whole seventh floor it blasted out freezing air right on your back
i went right to the reception complaining about it and a young gentleman at the reception told me nobody has ever complained about it if it still bothers you tomorrow morning well turn the ac down
well one of the reasons i really like this hotel chain is that everything is always perfect and they take care of problems asap i hate having to complain move around once im settled down so i never went back
breakfast the following morning was a challenge i asked for a continental breakfast plus yougurt and eggs but i got the bill instead of the eggs strange i though lets see tomorrow morning the day after i chose the american breakfast same story after a 45 minute wait i still hadnt got my eggs so i just paid and left on the third day they finally managed to deliver the right order in a decent time 
i also had lunch once day and it was decent but not the excellent quality i was used to at the fs besides you eat on plastic table mats which is really a let down for a high end hotel what a difference from the fs in paris where they iron the table clothes before setting the table i remember they had them also the other time i was there but being service and food excellent you dont really mind this time though it bothered me a lot maybe because i spent a lot of time staring at them waiting for my breakfast
i had to be back for another two days but i cancelled ny reservation and decided for the fairmont instead while i was there the hotel was celebrating its 25th birthday an old dame living on fame and memories",3.0
great fun with a toddler,really enjoyed the night i stayed at the hudson and would recommend it for travelling with very small children mine is 25 we got upgraded to an enormous room with two queen sized beds and a cot and a little lobby for the buggy to be parked and an ensuite bathroom lovely views over manhattan staff were gorgeous and everyone was incredibly helpful and sympathetic towards me single mother although they are a tad disorganised food was delicious and not unreasonably priced cocktails on the sky terrace a bit ho hum children not allowed in the gym swimming pool which you can get membership to its across the street which was not what id been told and there were various muddles like that its an immense skyscraper and the corridors are a bit spooky  at times i think the design crosses the line between cool postmodern and weird sinister but generally i had a blast here and would happily go again,4.0
good airport overnight,"this hotel was nice because the rooms though small are brand new and very clean the bed was comfy and there were lots of modern amenities like a flat panel tv and granite counters in the bathroom
the hotel is very close to the airport and is perfect if you have an early flight in the morning the free shuttle will take you to the airport and pick you up after your flight you can leave your car parked at the hotel during your trip and the first five nights are free
the only complaints i have are that there was a problem with our checkin travelocitys fault not theirs that they said they were going to fix but still hadnt the next morning when we checked out eventually it was all taken care of also the walls are rather thinour neighbors tv was turned up loud and was somewhat bothersome
overall a very good value especially if you take advantage of the park n fly program",4.0
great value at a very nice hotel,my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights and i can indeed recommend this hotel huge spacious rooms nicely decorated elemis bath products and just really good service we took a look at 3 different rooms before deciding  and the staff was absolutely fine with it we ended up with a standard room  the biggest i have seen in sf and with the most amazing view rooms have everything you need and is just lovely we had breakfast at top of the hotel top of mark and it was a good experience  good food also healthy options and fantastic views overall a very positive experience  and at great value too  we paid 150 dollars per night during the weekend which is good value,5.0
good value and very clean,one night stay for work very comfortable and clean king room other reviews prompted me to ask for quiet room which i got almost very little noise from the l but across from the vending machine room that proved a nonstarter though much louder are the dorms in the hall slamming shut room big bathroom immaculate asked for bb special which incl up to 25 breakfast voucher at 1st floor restaurant worst coffee ive had in ages but otherwise it was fine plenty of starbucks nearby did learn that after 7pm most everything closes up which includes retailers on state st as well as a number of food places definitely not a place that will make you want to wander around at night,4.0
extremely disappointed,what a big disappointment this was my 4th trip to the resort and my experience was not good i had bragged and bragged on the hotel and was so eager to take my son and two nephews for a 4 day trip to san antonio i phoned the morning of my arrival from the road to make sure all of the reservations were in order and that we would be receving 2 double beds  1 mom and 3 boysages 916 upon arrival i was told we could only get a king size bed and was treated very very rudely finally a manager gave us the double bedsof course he never came out of his office to speak to us only sent word with the clerk who was a monster the service was horrible especially by the pool and there was a smell by the pool that smelled like sewer the lazy river failed to work consistently was dirty and was extrememly shallowobviously needing to be refilled i will never return,2.0
great hotel,i recently stayed at the le parker meridien over easter for two nights with my 14 year old daughter we stayed in a superior king bedroom that we had booked for 200 dollars on their website the staff concierge and bellman were very friendly and helpful the location was really great and was only a few minutes walk to central park times square and 5th avenue our trip was mainly for shopping and therefore my daughter loved that we were only about a block away from 5th avenue where stores such as lacoste abercrombie gap and h and m were i was impressed with the room which was on the small side like all new york rooms but still very nice and modern we ate one night at the burger joint in the lobby of the hotel hidden behind a brown curtain it had amazing burgers for 6  and had many raving reviews by the washington post and new york times on their walls i highly highly recommend this place for a quick burger and fries during the day or a late night snack i can not wait until we vistit new york city again and have the pleasure of staying at the le parker meridien,5.0
good location to wharf area,"we stayed here for one night to check out pier 39 fishermans wharf and to go to alcatraz there is a parking fee of 4045 but most nice hotels have that in the area the nice thing is you dont have to worry about your car when its parked in the garage and the hotel is a 12 blocks from fishermans wharf 
we stayed in a king room it was nicenothing to jazzy or special but it did the trick the breakfast in the morning was good as well 
staff was nice im rating this place a 3 for some reason and im not quite sure why i just didnt get that above and beyond service or warm fuzzy feeling nothing was really wrong either it was just soso to us",3.0
tired shabby and larcenous,"my wife and i recently visited nyc this was my wifes first visit to the city so i surprised her with a stay at the plaza unfortunately the plaza experience i had hoped to give my wife turned out to be more akin to the experience one might have expected from the nyc of thirty years ago 
before i get into the unpleasant aspects of our stay at the plaza let me first mention the things that i like about the plaza first the location is hard to beat second the walkin shower in our room was the best ive ever seen in a hotel it was large beautiful and the water pressure was strong enough to knock over a small elephant third the bed was one of the most comfortable i have ever slept on in a hotel fourth if you like historical buildings which my wife and i do the plaza has much to offer fifth the staff was in the main friendly and helpful unfortunately there were material exceptions to numbers four and five which ill get into in a moment
the traveler should be aware that the famous oak room is not open for business the website does not make this clear unless you actually attempt to make an online reservation 
the traveler should likewise be aware that the rose suite is not in fact a suite but instead a large oddlyshaped room with a great deal of wasted space to be fair the website does include a floor plan of the suite so i did not rent the room in complete ignorance of what i was getting nevertheless suite generally indicates a bedroom and sitting room separated by a wall one gets the sense that the plaza is a tired property trading on its name and prior reputation and this sort of hucksterism is indicative of that unfortunate reality 
the room featured an ipad which we were supposed to be able to use to control the air conditioning in the room and check our account balance among other features unfortunately the aforementioned features which were the ones in which i was most interested never worked engineerings best efforts notwithstanding 
upon our arrival i asked where the gym was and was told it was under construction again there was no indication of this on the website as things stand today the plazas idea of a gym is two treadmills one elliptical machine and a set of free weights stuffed into a tiny guest room on the 19th floor there is one television in the room which is inexplicably located behind the treadmills and elliptical the treadmills and elliptical do not have the usual builtin television which means that a typical la quinta has better exercise equipment than the plaza thanks to this carefullyplanned arrangement the people on the treadmills get to look at the building across the street while those like me who prefer the elliptical get to look at the wall marvelous on the second day of our stay i arrived at the gym at around 715 am to find that there were no towels i called the front desk and asked for some towels evidently i was not the first person who had called since the woman at the front desk sounded annoyed and said that someone was on the way with towels the towels finally arrived around 20 minutes later 
while the plaza is an interesting historical building its interior was surprisingly tired and even shabby at points the carpet on the guest floors is faded and badly in need of replacement and there are many places which cry out for a simple paint touchup that these basic maintenance items have not been addressed is odd to say the least 
all of the above left the impression that the plaza is a fading and indifferentlymanaged property given the amount of money they charge for lodging this fact was irritating but tolerable even though ive stayed in much nicer hotels in the neighborhood for much less however the experience i am about to describe is beyond the pale the day before we arrived i called the concierge and asked them to place a pallet of bottled water in our room my expectation was that they would run out to a nearby market and get me a case of water as this has been my experience with the exact same request at other hotels in the neighborhood when i arrived there was no water at all in the room so i went down to the concierge desk recounted the conversation i had had the day before and asked again for a pallet of bottled water the concierge said they would be happy to comply when we returned that night there were 24 bottles of water in our room when it came time a few days later to check out i noticed a room service charge for 28800 since we had not ordered room service i questioned the charge at which time they showed me the ticket which revealed that the 28800 was the charge for the 24 bottles of water for those of you not inclined to do arithmetic in your heads thats 1200 per bottle i explained that i had expected the concierge to run out to a market and pick up a case of water for me not send me bottles from room service in order to gouge the crap out of me after much conversation the manager finally agreed to reduce the charge by 30 and promised she would talk to the concierge and get the situation resolved the resolution i got was the following email
dear mr warr
 we sincerely hope you and mrs warr had a wonderful stay with us and return trip home was uneventful
 i have just spoken with guest reception manager regarding your request for a case of water as a hotel concierge we always order from in room dining when guests order food or beverages unless otherwise specifically requested
i am sorry if you had something else in mind when we spoke it is absolutely my intention to fulfill the request in the way you would like once again i apologize if there was a misunderstanding
 we look forward to welcoming you back to the plaza hotel new york please do not hesitate to contact us for any additional assistance
 regards
well gee thanks but youre still charging me 840 for a bottle of water for those of you out there who hate math thats 1200 less 30 nyc used to have the reputation of a place where outoftowners would get ripped off and swindled thankfully the city has done much to free itself of this perception over the last thirty years it is unfortunate that among the many excellent traditions a venerable institution like the plaza might choose to uphold they have chosen to uphold one that is so unsavory and unethical 
there are several hotels in the neighborhood which are less expensive have better rooms nicer amenities and most importantly policies designed to serve the guests not cheat them the next time i come to the city ill be staying at one of those places ill never be back to the plaza",1.0
exceeded every expectionstaff was impressive,"my 13 year old daughter and i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights from the moment we checked in with the front desk manager patrick to the end of our vacation this hotel staff exceeded every expectation we felt the hospitality from all staff members we got an unbelievable rate for this hotel room and could not believe how close were were to the two broadway shows webought tickets for and we were12 block from times square

greektown treats you like a number,had a great stay with the room the next day my girlfriend left her ring on the bathroom counter and we checked out half hour later she realized it was left on the counter we called the front desk to ask if they could just go get it really quick and solve the issue right there we were just transferred to different phone lines and voicemails that told us they would get to it in 2448 hours we talked to numerous people who all sounded like they were reading off of a flow chart in dealing with it if they would have just treated us like a human and actually listened to what we were saying then it could have been solved in minutes instead it has been over a week and we have not and probably will not receive a response on the ring it was a ring that belonged to my girlfriends mother who passed away greektown still says the same exact thing and send us to a voicemail in the security office to this day not one person from greektown has looked up from their script and felt bad in anyway possible no wonder why they are bankrupt and mgm continues to kill them in popularity that is where i will go for sure from now on,1.0
mixed feelings about the nexus,"we were coming into town for a friday night mariners game then saturday trapeze lessons for the kids i could find nothing in the downtown or seattle center areas under 450 per night apparently there was a very large convention in town and they had all the rooms booked i was therefore left to look outside the downtownlake unionseattle center core our usual places to stay when coming into seattle overnight are silver cloud stadium pricey but fun rooftop pool marqueen love love love it here holiday inn express near space needle cookie cutter hotel but convenient silver cloud lake union great breakfast area  like a huge living room overlooking marina paramount great to stay if taking in a show at paramount theatre and we love the dragonfish restaurant watertown by the university etc i only mention these so you know what kind of places we customarily stay 
now for the nexus hmmm we upgraded to a suite for an additioinal 50 since there were 4 of us 2 adults a teen and a tween one room contained the living area and sparse kitchen the other room contained 2 queen beds everything in the room seemed clean but i was still leary of the couch and carpet the beds were comfortable and the bath area was clean there was 2 robes provided didnt use them and enough towels which were fluffy and clean the place still has the motel feel to it even though theyve tried to spiff it up a bit 
maybe the nexus should do away with their shuttle and they would get better ratingsthis is where things were both good then a bit bad for us you can reserve the shuttle up to 24 hours prior to your arrival and i was very impressed when a desk clerk called me on thursday morning at my home to verify our friday afternoon check in and shuttle reservations to go to safeco field for fridays game great off to a good start
we checked in and verified our shuttle to the game we were in lobby ahead of time and loaded up in the 11 passenger van plus one seat for the driver the driver was dismayed that there were reservations for 12 passengers and we of course couldnt all fit  so after a bit of time we changed vans and headed onto i5 stopped traffic i completely understand that traffic is not the hotels fault but when we eventually got to the ballpark area the driver seemed lost and made a series of rights and lefts  we could see the stadium  we just couldnt get there he eventually dropped us in a parking lot about 3 or 4 blocks from the stadium  no problem we walked only now it is getting really close to game time and we had hoped to be there an hour or so early the biggest glitch with the shuttle is that we were unknown to us supposed to schedule the ride back to the hotel as well well the shuttle reservations for the ride back were full so we ended up paying 30 tip for cab from safeco to nexus i suppose it is my fault for neglecting to confirm but i assumed the shuttle service was round trip so my tip is to reserve both legs of your shuttle at the time of reservation 
breakfast was drearily bad the next morning we got to the breakfast room about 12 hour before it was due to close and they were out of many items no eggs bacon crumbs only in floating grease etc but the worst part was how dirty the whole breakfast room was we were told the hotel was completely full the night before  so maybe they just were unprepared for a full hotel eating breakfast free  breakfasts can always be a bit hit and miss so we just took this with a grain of salt 
of note the closest open place to get a drink once we got back to the hotel after the mariners game was the ram  on the other side of the freeway 510 minute walk but the walk felt a little unsafe the bar and grill on the hotel property closes at 10pm 
im not sure id recommend this place or stay here again it wasnt creepy horrible but it wasnt great either if we couldnt find a place in the downtown area id try somewhere else in the northgate area before staying here again",3.0
service doesnt get any better in new york,stunning is all i can say  from the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff excelled themselves beautiful suite with every imaginable extra we only had breakfast there on the two mornings but there was everything you could ever wish for to eat we will always stay here each time we visit ny,5.0
southern hospitality at its finest,"we traveled to charlotte last weekend for wedding and stayed at the charming dunhill within walking distance of shopping parks music museums and nightlife it is well appointed and warm the staff is courteous and efficient the room itself was just the right size for both of us a very comfortable bed and fluffy pillows flat screen tv writing desk ample storage  modern bathroom and lovely view of uptown charlotte from our window soda and water in the room refrigerator are complementary there is no ice machine but ice is readily and quickly available upon request i needed a scissors and had one in hand in under 5 minutes

loved it ,"my sister in law and i stayed here for 3 days and we loved it 
we felt like queens for those 3 days too and we do get out somewhat
anyway we had a wonderful time here we stayed in the old historical

the room was very clean also 
the doormen were 1 on my list too they were always right there
getting you in and out of cabs very nice gentlemen too
the concierge was helpful too even had umbrellas for us to use
the staff was very friendly and helpful in every way too
all i can say is this place was fabulous and we are coming back",5.0
horrible,i went to this hotel for my 40th birthday and i have to say it is the worst hotel ive ever stayed in i never want to go back the room was old dated yellow net curtains stains on the floors disgusting foul and depressing the staff were rude and arrogant although cheap do not stay there if you go to new york for the first time and have great expectations nothing more to say only yuck,1.0
very pleasant stay,convenient capitol hill location  and a 4 minute walk from union station and amtrak rooms are nice and clean kimpton intouch members get free in room wifi and a 10 mini bar credit check often for specials on rooms  when congress is not in session you can get very good rates recently stayed there and it will be my hotel of choice next time i need to be in the heart of town,5.0
good location with parking  clean but a little dated,"i was looking for a relatively cheap hotel i object to paying high hotel prices in a good location i found it at this hotel 
first there is ample parking for which there is a small fee which is a great advantage in la thankfully there was none of that valet nonsense which annoys me i am quite capable of parking my own car the staff were helpful despite their english being a little limited 
the hotel was well located and it only used to take us about 15 minutes if that to get to the main attractions in the city it was clean and perfect for what i needed basic clean good location breakfast was adequate bagels rolls cereal etc
the hotel is right next to china town and union station 
all in all i was happy",3.0
dirtiest hotel ive ever stayed in do not stay here,"one star is generous though very well located please heed my warnings and book a stay elsewhere my friend and i payed close to 150 a night for a room unfit for a rat sure the room was small there was no view the furnishings were sparse and the walls were scuffed and dented and spackled sporadically i wouldnt have cared one bit had it been somewhat clean 
unfortunately there was crumpled toilet paper and other randomly strewn trash under the bed there were crumbs and what appeared to be blood stains on the sheets there were giant dust bunnies cobwebs and little curly hairs throughout the bathroom oh and exposed electrical precariously close to the shower 
i have stayed in 10 hostels throughout europe that are immaculately clean there is no excuse for the manhattan broadway hotel do not stay here",1.0
the w new york downtown needs to regroup,"my husband and i stayed at the w downtown nyc on september 1618 2011 i really dont know how to explain our experience we arrived late because we were driving from the boston area when we arrived we were greeted cordially by a doorman and escorted to the lobby on the 5th floor
when we arrived on the 5th floor there was an incredible blast of music the music was somewhere between disco and rap my husband and i owned a discotheque for six years so we were not too shocked what were disconcerting were the lights on the curved ceiling that reflected off the floor the experience was not good we had to navigate to the next set of elevators the optical illusion was not comfortable we felt like we were drunk 
 at first we thought since were older than the target demographic we couldnt make a fair evaluation however after talking with young people late twenties to forties they felt the same way they told us that they were upset and disoriented by the lights music and layout of the hotel 
 our room 2211 was clean but extremely small the bed was very comfortable and probably the best part of our stay the bathroom had very little space there was nowhere to put a toothbrush or any cosmetics maybe this would be a great room for a single business person if you would like to see how you look before proceeding to a meeting you would wonder where is the mirror its on the backside of the closet door if you open the closet door lean against the other door and youre really thin you might be able to see yourself 
 we stayed at the w in boston and it was one of the best experiences in our lives the w nyc downtown needs to take a look at what other w hotels do 
 our children live in nyc and we visit often this was our first stay at the w downtown nyc we wont be back the location was bad the streets and sidewalks were blocked off due to construction we couldnt even take a walk we were trapped like rats in a maze
 our advice to the w downtown is to
1 expand your target demographic and redesign the lobby and guest rooms to meet the needs of a more diverse clientele all guests whether they are 20 or 60 want a quiet clean comfortable place to relax i believe all travelers business people and tourists want the same thing 
2 put a shelf in the bathroom so guests can store their toiletries 
3 install a fulllength mirror on the outside of the closet door
4 repaint in the guestrooms and hallwaysthis would freshen up and brighten up these areas 
5 work out a plan with the cab companies to actually come down the street for customers your doorman told us to just go take the subway
6 visit some great hotels in the area like the andaz and gild hall to pick up some pointers
7 rearrange the elevator configuration going up five floors to the lobby is not a good plan guests should not have to wangle their way from the checkin desk go across the dance floor and walk in front of the dj to get to the next bank of elevators which will eventually take them to their rooms
8 tone down the elevator music find music that is appealing to all 
9 supply the correct email address when sending out a survey gmwolfgangwehenwhotelscom is not a valid email address the email gets returned remove the gmwe called to get the correct address
unfortunately you cannot change your location maybe in about ten years when the construction has stopped this will be a good location 
sincerely
mike and jane starwood preferred guests
the gm wolfgang wehen actually read and responded to our concerns this is a step in the right direction retrain or fire you current employees focus point customer service i think in this economy you will be able to find people who actually understand and believe in the adage the customer is always right",2.0
old and tired,"we had 2 rooms and both were very tired and old definitely the poorest hotel of our trip although not the cheapest the electric beds do not work anymore and the whole place needs renovation desperately it is not really a radisson in style
the good points are the location which is very convenient to alcatraz ferry and it has very good free wi fi reception which even works in the ihop restaurant next door 
it was clean and while the car parking was expensive it was very close to our room the car park has a great view too not the rooms however
the other fishermans wharf hotels are very close by so i would recommend trying one of the others if the prices are similar",2.0
uninhabitable  needs shutting down  disgusting place,"after reading all the reviews about this hotel i thought it would be a good idea to stay here i was wrong i think the reviews are written by the owners here is the truth about this disgusting uninhabitable hotel 
 it is run by an unfriendly indian family who dont care one bit about customer service and are only after your money they didnt even have the courtesy to say greet us whenever we entered or left the hotel
the good things
 the room is big 
 24 hour concierge desk open
the bad things
where to start firstly the location is not the best it is on the backstreets of the tenderloin depending on how much you want to see beggars on the streets  thats up to you but we felt uncomfortable daily there were police cars stopping in our road at 3am really dont get much sleep in this hotel in addition it is right in front of a massage parlour
the hotel lift says it is out of service but it is not they simply dont want to pay for maintenance but it does work dont be fooled 
the lobby area is in need of a complete redecoration the carpet is filthy 
the continental breakfast does not exist you have to ask the lady at the lobby for tea she will make it herself and then give you a disgusting old pastry this was so humiliating it felt like we were school children i cant understand why they cant open up a room and treat us like adults to make our own tea 
the bedroom 
the bed had fleasbedbugs 
the linen was dirty  there was blood on it from the previous customers  absolutely disgusting
the towels were ripped and dirty they were circulated from one room to another without being washed there was hair from another person on ours 
the one time they did clean the towels they put them in bleach this was intoxicating we could not use them there was such a strong smell of bleach it was suffocating they do not have washing machines in this place a little indian lady carries the towels on her tummy and washes them by hand
the bathroom sensor light doesnt work
the tv didnt work
they have removed the additional lighting in the ceiling to save money the room was dark
finally dont pay them a penny for the internet service  there is free wifi anyway if you have a wifi device turn it on and use the free net that san fran has to offer
this hotel needs shutting down dont waste your money or be fooled by the positive reviews go somewhere else i sincerely regret staying there they wouldnt offer us a refund the man at the desk even had the cheek to ask for our passports as a deposit absolutely unacceptable
i wish i could give it no stars",1.0
great for personal and business travel,"i stayed at the peabody memphis for a work conference in june 2011 its too bad i cant give it 5 stars we had a few dead roaches in the conference center we were using and were met with an egh it happens but the staff were attentive the rooms spacious and the location great id recommend holding an event here
we also stayed a few extra days for vacation time and had an equally good time again the only issue was that there were a lot of events that weekend two weddings i think and we felt not being dressed as nicely since we were only sightseeing that we werent treated as well as i had been as i was earlier in the week
the roof was fun as was the duck walk  something to def do at least once",4.0
crowne plaza at its best,i just returned from a trip to nyc i was there 3 nights and because cost was an issue i stayed at 3 hotels which i bid for on priceline the third was the crowne plaza broadway 255 this is definitely a topoftheline luxury hotel the front desk staff was friendly helpful and able to accommodate our special requests the room was clean spacious and comfortable and very well decorated the hotel is in a great location on broadway very close to the subway walking distance to rockefeller center as we were changing hotels so frequently we needed to ask the hotels to store our luggage the bell staff at the crowne was exceptionally helpful as they had said it might be difficult to get into our luggage midafternoon but they were very quick to get it for me midafternoon and very very nice about it joking around and helping me manage to get what i needed at the time we stayed the hotel was under a bit of construction the broadway entrance was closed which didnt bother us at all the bar was also closed but next door there was a bar where we went for a nightcap additionally ive never seen a hotel so careful about security at night at both the door and the elevator you need to show your room keycard to a security guard to gain entrance,4.0
pefectly fine for the price,hey people when you book a hotel that costs half what the hilton charges youre not going to get the hilton it was perfectly fine for the price and location  room was clean everything worked even the tv remote hot water was steady the major problem was that the only working ice machine was on the 4th floor whoopdedoo will stay there again in fact i already booked it for next month,3.0
had stayed before would probably stay again,"previously stayed and and had a shared bathroon and the experience was top rate this time we decided to book a private bathroom as we had a wee bit more money to spare and were getting a great rate 
however the private bathroom we had was adjoining the shared bathroom and there was a fair bit of noise from those using it the biggest noise was the pipes after flushing the toliet from either bathroom the pipes started making noises that would have awoken sleeping beauty the other big problem was that the room was freezing as the radiator was not working it was well below freezing outside after a couple of nights we couldnt take any more and asked to change rooms they did this with little fuss and got a much bigger room with a working radiator however the pipe noises did return on the last night
thats the bad bit the good is the location is excellent quiet for ny but the express subway gets you to times square in five minutes it is very clean and if you are lucky you can get a good size room unlucky a large cupboard it is by far and away the best value hotel for the poorer nyc tourist hotel in new york pay your money take your chances",3.0
awful service but good location,the location of this hotel is great if you looking to stay directly in the theater district then this is the place however dont stay at amsterdam court if your looking for a friendly or helpful staff the front desk was not very friendly  the bartenders were just plain rude and not in the the new yorker way the rooms were tiny and the shower flooded overall i wouldnt stay here again for the rate ny brings in people from all over the world the staff should be more accommodating overall really disappointing,2.0
worst hotel i have ever stayed at in nyc,"i usually stay in kimpton hotels while in nyc but this time opted for affinia due to its proximity to the penn station having read a few alarming reviews here regarding noise level and elevators being painfully slow i dismissed them as coming from people who probably complain a lot now i regret not taking those reviews into consideration more carefully
i booked a deluxe room through unitedcom and requested two beds costing me more than 320night upon arrival i was informed that the rooms with two beds were not available but there was a pullout couch in our room this was not ideal but satisfactory the room we were given was on the 3rd floor and upon entering it i knew exactly what the poor reviews of this hotel were about as the noise level was excruciating i felt like we were outside thats how loud it was i believe one of the problems is poorly installed windows as they leaked both noise and air then i noticed small hairs on the bathroom floor  not the cleanliness level i expect for more than 300night 
having barely survived the first night due to constant earsplitting noise from the outside and loud ac unit inside we went to take an elevator downstairs to eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant the next day there were a few people already waiting for an elevator for more than 10 minutes at that point a few minutes later a man came down by stairs from the 20th floor because he was tired of waiting for an elevator however he had to exit the staircase on the third floor because there was no exit to the lobby from the stairs i didnt believe him and took the stairs on the other end of the building trying to find the way out the door to the lobby was locked there too we returned to the third floor and i called the front desk for suggestions as to how we could get out since two elevators that stopped during the 20minute wait period were full the employee said that we could not get down through stairs which is a violation of a fire code and our only option was to wait for an elevator which was not option at all since they would not stop on our floor or arrive fully crowded in the end we had to take an elevator that was going upstairs to the 27th floor and then slowly come down wasting at least 3040 minutes on the whole process the same scenario repeated two days later on several occasions the elevator would not even stop on the 3rd floor when going up thus again adding more time and painful frustration to our trip 
now i would like to comment on the quality at the hotel restaurant  it is mediocre at best i had scallops for dinner the first night and they still had sand on them ie not thoroughly washed and breakfast dishes the next day were tasteless now i understand why hotel guests are offered 20 off at the restaurant do not eat there as there are plenty of superb restaurant options within walking distance on the 8th avenue and 46th street
but this is not the final list of my complaints when the temperature outside dropped we could not get the heating system in our room to work an engineer came by and tried to fix it to no avail and then he brought a cover for the window ac unit because he saw how much air that window was leaking and also brought us a space heater i have to say he was the only staff member who displayed a concern for the situation we were in
upon checkout i expressed all the complaints stated here to the front desk and was offered to deduct 70 off my bill i thought this was a poor attempt to compensate for truly dreadful experience during our stay as it definitely spoilt what was supposed to be a fun weekend",1.0
please do not go here,this hotel is a joke 2 doors up there is another hotel that is 100 times better we arrived at the hotel early in the morning and were greeted by the must unusual of smells a mix between curried papadams and incense the guy behind the desk was very unhelpful and grudgingly said he would look after our baggage until the room would be ready returning at 3pm for check in we discovered the room had only 1 bed when we had asked for 2 doubles the man at the desk said we could purchase a futon for an extra 3500 for two nights my friend later referred to this as the floor bed as it was like sleeping on the floor later that night our toilet blocked up and was overflowing the family who run the hotel all came to help which was very embarrassing and using no gloves proceeded to unblock the toilet they then informed us that breakfast would be served downstairs the next morning hygiene aside we had already decided to breakfast elsewhere we were so appalled by the state of the hotel and the unfriendliness of the staff that we booked our tours through the hotel up the street other guests we talked to on leaving said it was the worst experience of their lives the picture on the net doesnt even look like the hotel its almost like they have taken a different hotels picture on my world trip out of 20 hotels this was undoubtly the worst next time your in san fran give it a miss its just not worth it,1.0
elegant without being aloof,i stayed at this property for my birthday weekend and had a fabulous time great location a much bigger room that i was expecting  sometimes older properties can be cramped  and the massive walk in shower more than made up for the lack of a bathtub superb quality mattress and bedding and the bathrobes were very comfortable i will definitely stay here again,5.0
pretty in pink isnt she,the langham boston put the couture in boston boutique hotels its a beautiful property with decor that would calm the most exhausted traveler the service is very good and the breakfast at le fleur was excellent stayed here on business but its really a property to stay at when you have time to relax with that special someone enjoy,4.0
after frustrating booking exceptional service in fine facilities good value at 200,"our experience at aloft harlem began unpleasantly after finding a low rate on expedia we attempted to take advantage of the low price guarantee advertised by starwood the company behind the aloft brand except that after filling forms and providing information we received a dry email informing us that the request has been rejected the reason starwood could not verify the lower price on expedia and why would they considering that they waited 48 hours before checking at which point the sale was over
so we didnt receive the price guarantee but that didnt dampen our pleasure at aloft harlem a testament to the gentrification of the neighborhood the hotel is as stylish as any other in the chain but the service is what sets it apart and thats quite an achievement anyone we met  anyone  was friendly thoughtful and accommodating from the receptionist who initiated changing our room to a quiet one even before we had the wits to ask to the chambermaid who suggested convenient time to come by
so something in starwood works right if not in the reservation department than certainly in training and standards if this property continue to shine on service itll be an exceptional one",5.0
high marks,"we typically stay at the sofitel across the street but gave the palomar a try based on the positive reviews here as well as a more competitive rate we arrived around 100 pm and our room wasnt available yet official check in is at 300 they took my cell number stowed our bags for us and said they would call we never got a call and returned around 330 the rooms were probably oversold as the desk clerk couldnt seem to find one open standard queen they ended up giving us an upgrade to a higher floorroom w view so no complaints 
positives hotel has the inherent advantage of being newer room was nicely appointed incl ipod dock flat screen tv clean with contemporary decor staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming from the valet to the bell hop to the front desk personnel although we didnt take advantage they have free coffeetea in the mornings and a wine reception in the evenings valet service was reasonably prompt 
negatives room was very small no prices were evident for the minibar contents but as we found out at checkout the charges were pretty ridiculous 45 for a small water for example ridiculous but admittedly not uncommon hotel is petfriendly and we heard some yappy dogs while walking down the hall would not have been happy had we ended up in an adjoining room not sure if this was luck of the draw or if they try to separate the pet owners from the rest 
overall experience was positive at the palomar and we will likely return",4.0
mediocre hotel in a fur coat,"for the life of me i can not imagine why this is rated as a 445 star hotel it is a nice property and if stars were awarded solely for location the intercontinental would be tops it was amazing to pull to the side of michigan ave and hand the valet our key the staff on the street were very motivated and friendly and helped us into the lobby very courteously but precisely at this point the experience stopped being amazing
the lobby is fairly mediocre with nice touches but it is very small and there is no traffic pattern at busy times people checking in will get mixed into people waiting for concierge services the front desk staff were nice but not incredibly efficient or overly concerned with providing superior service they were competent at best the setup of the concierge desk is very impersonal and the staff look and act simply like more front desk staff the staff seemed to portray the same aloof forcedinterest in the customer that i had experienced at the front desk 
the room was even less impressive it was at the end of a long and serpentine hallway and the room directly across from it was both unmarked and had a door that look like it had been scratched open by wolves i am not kidding the door across the hall so damaged that it looked like it was in a neglected apartment building once in the room it was small but reasonably appointed with two full size beds i hadnt slept in a full size bed since high school and a very small bathroom upon further inspection the room had dust on the fixtures and wall hangings stained duvets in the covers and crumbs in the carpet near the walls in the bathroom the faucet fixture was missing the fake white pearl on the cold faucet leaving an exposed screw the bathroom also featured two panels that looked like fuse boxes that were disturbingly loose against the wall
all night long there was something that sounded like a very loud shower that ran whenever the heat was on i heard this sound whenever i was in the hallway on our floor at times i also smelled a bad odor in our room throughout the night 
finally in terms of amenities i can not figure out the 45 star rating in this hotel i went out to get some ice and looked on my floor plus the next two floors up from my floor i then picked up the floor courtesy phone and asked where i could find some ice i was told that the seventh floor was the ice floor are you kidding i did find two ice machines on the seventh floor again they were very competent
everything is an upcharge from 57 dollarnight parking which is comparable but still more than most chicago properties to internet in room services and more michael jordans restaurant and bar are nice but i was referred to walgreens to bring gelato up to my room really",3.0
excellent room and friendly staff,stayed 2 nights and loved the quality cleanliness and decor of our 23rd floor room with stunning view over the city and bay excellent price at about 90 a night probably best value in whole 10 days of us travelling if i have any comments id say the sit down breakfast buffet is way overpriced and your better off to take the grab and go breakfast location is excellent for shopping though do watch you dont turn down one street next to hotel which i took walk thru one early morning and regretted all staff were great thoroughly recommend,4.0
good location value and room size,stayed here for several nights with my family in early april 2012 it was my third stay the hotel is a good combination of room size location and expense the rooms were clean and the service was excellent,5.0
room not ready,we arrived at 1000 pm stood behind another guest at the reception desk in the nonpreferential guest line who was being offered free wifi bottles of water and very polite attention we received unfriendly service the offer of expensive wifi no water and were told that our room with a king size bed was not ready and housekeeping would be sometime getting it ready we accepted another room which was very large but very sparsely furnished the hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of most places we wanted to go,3.0
spacious room but could use upkeep improvement,we booked through travelocity use secret hotel deal for 88  tax and fees for 2 people we got a fantastic deal our suite was a conference suite which meant it had a large table a queen size foldout couch and a king size bed it also had a mini bar with small fridge and separate freezer compartment but no microwave however a microwave was available in the ice and vending area everything could use a little sprucing up cleaningwise but it seems sanitary the fitness center was very small but had very good quality life fitness equipment overall we would definitely stay again if we got the same deal but probably not if we were paying the full normal rate parking was an additional 7 per day fee,4.0
best in class,"as a customer service trainer by profession and a semifrequent traveler im easy to satisfy but hard to impress hyatt place did both all of the recommended reviews for this hotel were on the money the few negative comments about construction and customer service issues are outdated now and this is the place to go the drive to downtown was exceptionally easy and it felt good to get away from all of the business of downtown after we were finished for the day the 42 flat screen room decor pillows beds lobby area business center etc are next to impossible to beat the best item was the lounge sofa with pull out bed in the room which made relaxing and watching the hdtv absolutely fantastic 
i have never signed up for reward points with any hotel chain this time i did hyatt place has a tagline its so you in my case that was totally true if you can get a discounted rate for the weekend etc for 99  109 you just gave yourself a true treat",5.0
the calm after the storm,"we arrived as a family of four from scotland friday 2nd november we had tried all week to get a proper update on what we were coming to and were not clear as information from both the hilton group and expedia was very limited after saving hard all year for this holiday we decided to go for it we arrived to find the hotel in complete darkness and were met by jatin the hotel manager i have to say that he became our guardian angel and allayed any fears we may have had jatin took control for us and tried to contact expedia on our behalf to see what alternative arrangements could be made this is when things got difficult as the silence from expedia was deafening jatin explained that our only option was to stay that night and if the power did not come on then he would look at other options for us thankfully the power came on at 5am and we were good to go thereafter we could not have been in a better hotel location and with excellent staff all round it ended up a fantastic holiday the hotel and staff cater for your every need and nothing is to much trouble the room was on the small side but very comfortable the breakfast and the all day coffee were excellent and there was always something that you could eat and cookies in the afternoon were a nice touch i would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definatley stay here again as the value for money is there for all to see once again a massive thankyou to jatin and his excellent team

great historic hotel dont believe the haters,i got this cheap rate at the last minute without reading all the negative reviews then i got super worried but once we actually got to the hotel we realized it was a perfectly fine old place i can only speak for my roomvisit but this is what i expect from any 1930s hotel not run by a huge chain friendly service clean remodeled room with some original features located across from the historic county courthouse and near where president kennedy was shot back in the 60s and deep ellum they have free fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and milk in the lobby at night pet friendly with valet and real restaurant i missed the continental breakfast so cant comment on that my room looked just like the site photos no free parking the downtown self park is just as much as the valet my room was neat and clean they go for the white clean bedspreads rather than weird floral ones had the standard little desk and tv free bottled water in your room real glassware yes it a little on the small side but certainly not unreasonable support your local businesses people not everything has to be huge and brand spanking new what about charm and personal service that this place offers in abundance,5.0
incredible service,"i went for three days on a business trip and i can say the service in this hotel is amazing i hardly recommend it the people at the reception desk the cleaning ladies very gently and disposed to answer at client needs
the gym is very well maintained they offer in water and towels the swimming pool clean
the rooms are comfortable and clean they have all facilities you need on a business trip in the room youll find coffee machine iron  iron desk hair dryer 
the only thing i had to complain is the restaurant the portions are incredibly big american style and the cook wasnt in his best mood so i received my meal cold even when the waiters service was excellent
obviously if you dont have a car you cant get anywhere in houston so the hotel arrange a free shuttle in the near areas thats really great sometimes you have to wait a bit cause it has been occupied by other clients but this idea i find it awsome very well done jose and chris two drivers handymen it etc   they made my stay more comfortable",4.0
helpful and comfortable conference stay,"we stayed here for several nights to attend a conference at the baltimore convention center while the hotel is a few about 4 total blocks away from the convention center for us the short walk was a nice break in our day to get away from the conference madness
the hotel itself has a large sweeping lobby and old fashioned elevators  there is a bank of four or five we never had issues with the elevators like some other reviewers mentioned the front desk staff and bellmen were all very helpful and friendly we had no issues at all that they were not willing to help us with
the room was spacious plenty of room for two people with luggage the wireless internet which is free was fast although the bathroom in our room was a little bit small we had a room with a small window although it overlooked the inner walls of the hotel  this is an old building so the rooms dont have large windows at the far end of the room like most modern hotels do
i did order room service one evening when i came back from all day at my conference and the very nice kitchen staff let me order off of the breakfast menu even though it was 10 pm the french toast and hasbrowns were very good  just what i wanted
the parking is 15day for self parking although they do have their own rampgarage our parking tickets that let you in and out of the parking facility did demagnetize one day which the front desk did not warn us about it was a mistake that took a while to fix and what keeps us from giving the hotel a better rating
overall if i needed to stay downtown in baltimore i would look at this hotel again but i wont be running back here to vacation",4.0
sheraton back bay,recently returned from a trip to boston from scotland to celebrate my husbands birthday stayed at this wonderful hotel with a beautiful room overlooking the charles river the rooms were thoroughly cleaned each day and you had the option ot have your bed linen changed each day would not hesitate to return clean and beautiful,5.0
nice city hotel,"ive stayed in many of the hotels in downtown chicago for business but this was a first to thewit overall a very good stay it is located in the theater district  so a close walk to see a christmas carol at the goodman location is great  tons of shopping and restaurants like other city hotels it is best to take advantage of valet parking and save yourself the headache helpful and friendly staff and as another review mentioned  rooms are clean and comfortable the beds were perfect we were not upgraded though i am an honors member
we did take a ride to the top to see the bar and the view since we had our 12 year old with us we just peeked the view is beautiful
the only issue i found dealt with the key cards in the elevator because the elevator is used by the public to get to the bar guests need to insert a key card to access their floor i am totally in favor of the extra safety but its not easy to quickly insert the key the right way and floor number before youve either missed your floor or gone in the wrong direction this happened several times and got to be a bit annoying 
overall this is a good find and would recommend to others
 the halls have the sound of birds chirping during the day and crickets in the evening and night  loved it",4.0
the happiest of businessmen,ive been told im usually a pain to book hotels for however upon returning from nyc for several meetings i had nothing but positive experiences the sohotels great location affordable pricing and cleanliness amplified by their polite service made for one of the best trips ive made to the city in a while most importantly it was quiet and there were no raucous dance parties taking place in the lobby like several other trendy new york hotels if youre looking for efficiency at a reasonable price this is a fantastic diamond in the rough,5.0
well sited,very art deco flavoured hotel room was good and clean although being at front of hotel it was extremely noisy am very surprised they dont have double glazing installed as constantly woken up at 6am by traffic outside ideally situated for exploring chinatown fishermans wharf etc union square it is so easy to get around by bus in san francisco so no excuse not to see everything had tea and coffee in lobby in morning and wine in evening shame there were no tea making facilities in room,4.0

a few remarks we are hilton honors members and weve stayed at the pointe well over 30 times in 20 years weve never used priceline but this time a friend guaranteed the best rate using his method and got a great deal for us upside is great rate downside is that not even god can get a refund if things go south ok we learned a lesson
we are not starryeyed conventioneers from ohio who have never seen a gorgeous mountain sunset or been anywhere with nine pools neither are we never satisfied hotel guests from hell hotels are staffed with people people are human nothing is perfect even so in over 25 years of global travel our stay at the pointe earned a place on our top 5 worst hotels ever list romanias hotel razvan taking first 
to management there is no excuse not one ever to have a mouse cockroach or other bug infestation and fail to act or disclose it employees who pretend not to notice problems or fail to report problems to managers suggest corporate culture issues minimizing problems and their effect on guests is not only arrogant it is insulting denying there is a problem at all when photographs exist everyone is looking directly at the problem mouse droppings wet soap mush in the tub black filthy floors cockroaches etc and when clearly the problem is recurring is dishonest failing at least to appear act fake or pretend to be interested in a guests unhappy and disgusting experience is unconscionable lastly failing to contact unhappy guests regardless of loyalty or whether they carry hh cards especially when a guest specifically requests it is a sign of utter contempt 
nota bene an online posting that starts with a template stating we are disappointed or we are saddened or we apologize for is unnecessary and its sincerity inherently suspect a bellman already informed us not to expect anyone to care about our nightmarish experience unless we post in trip advisor another employee told us that the gm faithfully reads the trip advisor reviews and responds because the reviews are public this is the same manager who never contacted us while we were there and still has not bothered to call
when we have more time we will post this review in other travel forums to which subscribe or of which we are members absent any spelling and grammar errors  haste and all that

excellent for overnight stays in dfw airport,"i stayed at the hyatt regency dfw with my wife for one night as part of a longer trip from brazil to hawaii we chose this hotel because the rate was quite good for a hyatt and it is located inside the airport area if you dont want to go to the town you can take the hotel shuttle or even walk from the airport to the hotel depending on the airport terminal you are
in my case i rented a car because i needed to go to downtown dallas however it can be quite though to get to the hotel through the different airport roads when you are driving you can actually see the hotel but it can be hard to get there the first time you try and the gps didnt help at all on the contrary the hotel provided selfparking the room is very quiet considering that you are inside the airport and it is also quite spacious bed was comfortable there was a good working desk and the rate i got had wifi included at a good speed and reliable hotel had some different dining options definitely i would recommend for an overnight stay near at the airport",4.0
the downtown standard still rocks,"the rooms at the standard are contemporary and totally original how cool to get a shower bigger than my whole bathroom at home

great location with relaxed style,the westin hotel in the tabor center is a frequent overnight spot for us when we are in town for the nightthe location is almost unbeatable as it is directly on the 16th pedestrian mall but within walking distance of hip lodo and upscale larimier square the hotel frequently offers specials online which include breakfast and valet parkingsaves you between 25  50 easily while the westin is a large chain this hotel still manages to have its own streamlined style and personalityits not wildly romantic but it is a nice place to getaway for fun and a little rr the rooms are very comfortable with nice linens and poofy comforters the staff is curteous and professional a side note  there is a see and be seen denver steak restaurant on the lower level called the palms its the place for power lunches or a fabulous martini on the weekend,4.0

sleepless in seattle thanks to this place,if you want a good nights sleep dont stay here as our apartment was having some renovation work done we decided to go to seattle for 2 nights to get away from the noise i arrived with my daughter to a long line at checkin i didnt mind as we were not in any rush went to the room which was a nonsmoking room to find cigarette butts on the ledge ouside the window along with two behind the bin in the room room 232 has plumbing problems i think all night you could hear a splashdrip loudly and due to the thin walls you could hear next door and upstairs flushing the toilet nonstop there was someone upstairs above us who spent the whole night pacing up and down and you could hear it quite loudly  possibly because this is an old creaky hotelinn or possibly because the person was walking heavy  either way we didnt sleep at allat 430am i couldnt stand the noise any more from the plumbing so went to the lobby and explained the situation they said they would change the room but had to wait until housekeeping had been to assess the vacant room situation at 8am after 35 hours sitting in the lobbly the guy on the desk gave me a new key to another room in a wallet that said check in time 4pmso waited until 10am now 55 hours sitting in the lobbly until he asked if there was something more he could do i explained i was waiting until we could go to the room at 4pmhe said sorry for the misunderstanding all their wallets said 4pm but the room was free now so went to the room it wasnt very clean dusty gum on the bedpost bath had bits of fluff and stuff in it carpet very stained and smelt very damp i opened the window and there was a bad smell looking out there was a very soiled diaper on the window ledge as well as more cigarette butts i went down to tell them about the diaper which they removed quite fast and i didnt get a chance to take a photo well we went to see a movie that night and got back at around 1130pm got washed and ready for bed and at 1230am went to sleep we were woken at 2am by so much noise outside the room i looked out of the spyhole to see about 8 people outside our door shreiking and laughing one woman was shouting at her kids it looked like they were just checking in yes at 2am so i left it for an hour but couldnt take it anymore i was just so tired i called the lobby and explained that it was so noisy and could they possibly ask them to keep the noise down i was told that there was a party of 11 people checking in and that if its too noisy i could change rooms i said i didnt want to be disrupted anymore and she was very off with me and said these people are checking in so if i dont like it i should move rooms well these people had at least 3 rooms between them and they were running from door to door slamming themtotal nightmare so disrespectful of these people but more so because sixth avenue were not interested in asking them to keep the noise down she said she would send security up but that didnt happen i must have dropped off to sleep for half an hour because at 4am i get a phone call from the lobby to say your pizza is here  confused i said what pizza she said again your pizza delivery is here followed by sorry maam wrong room i must have dropped off again because the room telephone rang again but when i answered they hung up  wrong room again i wonder so at 510am loud door banging again so many doors banging i looked through the spyhole again to find they are all in the corridoor argueing over sharing the pizzasthe noise was so bad even with ear plugs you could hear everything at 530am i decided i couldnt take anymore yes i was crying i was so tired and only came away to get some resti slept in our hire car and with all the traffic outside it was still quieter than the hotel room on leavingchecking out i ensured they knew what had happened even though most of it had been registered and felt i should not have to pay the bill i seriously felt they should have paid me for putting me through so much the lady on the desk  maria dianga  waved the parking charge but i still had to pay for the room for 2 nights i signed the bill to say it had been paid under protest she took everything down in detail and said she was unable to authorise complimentary rooms and that she would speak to her manager she gave me her card and told me that as it was a friday i wouldnt hear anything until the monday they have my email address and phone number for contact i heard nothing and it is now nearly 2 weeks and i have heard nothing i will be taking this up legally and contacting my credit card company to obtain a refund so if you dont mind staying up all night dont mind dust everywhere dont mind if people are smoking in their all nonsmoking rooms and a couldnt care less attutudego ahead and book also ask for another blanket before you go to sleep there is one very old bobbly blanket that has seen better days the one possitive is that this inn is very central and accessible i am attaching some photos i took of the room there is a lot of mould on the windows so allergy sufferers might want to consider this unfortunately i wasnt quick enough to picture the filthy diaper im very sorry to have to write such a negative report but i feel it is important for people to know that it is so noisy,1.0
nice rooms but staff unhelpful,the rooms at the hampton inn were very nice and were cleaned well everyday the female reception staff were not very friendly or very helpful the bellmen were nice and helpfulmore the afternoon guy that the morning bellman the breakfast manager was a nice guy the actually breakfast was pooreggs were not realthey used powered egg mix had to eat out of plastic platescutlery good location,2.0
elegant historic hotel in convenient downtown location,"my wife and i stayed four nights over new years weekend while attending the rose bowl with a group our room on the third floor faced the courtyard so street noise was not a problem it was clean and apparently recently renovated except for the television which was a bit blurry a flat screen would have been a welcome addition the bathroom wass clean although the fixtures are a bit dated 
the public areas of this hotel are what makes it a real gem it takes you back to the 1940s with its elegance and is a welcome change from the bland modern corporate type hotels we found the staff to be very friendly efficient and helpful the breakfast buffet was excellent as was the italian buffet in the lower level restaurant which we enoyed new years night the hotel is convenient to downtown attractions such as the staples center museums concert halls etc
we enjoyed our stay very much and look forward to returning if you like a historic hotel with character this is the place to go",5.0
really enjoyed this hotel,went to a convention at the sheraton in 52002 we had been advised by a friend to ask about the top floors since we were there with a convention we had a convention rate that my business would pay it turned out that upgrading the rooms was only 40 more a night and the view and amenities were really nice its probably more expensive to be on the very top floor but since they were out of the medium upgrade rooms they went ahead and put us up there at no extra chargethose rooms included breakfast anywhere in the hotel use of the spa and a lounge with internet access fresh flowers in the room and a killer view we were delighted,5.0
management and housekeeppers were the worst ive ever experienced,i would never recommend this place to anyone only if the management and housekeeping had better attitudes and would clean my room on a daily basis ive been here for over a month close to 6 weeks they have only cleaned my room less than half of the time and the most gross unpleasant thing was they made me unclog my own toilet the manager by the name of tina had the nerve to hand me the plunger herself instead of offering to unclog herself it was clogged for over 3 days that goes to show how often housekeeping comes and checks our roomsim constantly asking for towels and toilet paper myself all the women front desk have been very pleasant and helpful to me and my children if it werent for them i would have checked out the first week and took my business elsewhere housekeeping is beyond rude to my children while im at worktinas husband has been very very friendly and nice to me and my children as well i also have heard several guests during breakfast and private conversations that the management is rude which has brung me to write this review sincerely guest rm 103  105,1.0
nice getaway with a great view,"overall we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel i would recommend getting a second story room so you get a good view of the bay or the marina the view from our room and the restaurant was awesome  we had a marina view the staff was pleasant and accomodating the food for the continental breakfast and dinner was good but nothing spectacular compared to other hotels in the area i thought it was a good value for what we paid
there is a pier and small beach within walking distance and it is close to point loma and cabrillo national monument which has some great tide pools its a 1015 drive to sea world and mission beach if you have time visit the uss midway and take the tour it is well worth it plan on 34 hours to see everything on the ship",4.0
great introduction to san francisco,my husband and i pricelined this hotel for 100 a night first of all nob hill is a fabulous location for a hotel and ours intersected with two cable car lines which was even better the staff was very sweet and one of the nice women at the counter kept letting us into the business center to use the computer to check in with family the concierge was very helpful and had wonderful food suggestions i loved the nightly turndown service and the complimentary hot beverage every morning the toiletries were what you would expect from a nicer hotel and i loved the oldfashioned styling of the room my husband wasnt quite as fond since hes more into postmodern it definitely made our experience in san francisco one to remember id definitely stay there again,4.0
good business travel hotel,ive stayed at the club quarters a few times when i have to travel to downtown houston clean comfortable convenient and cheap    rooms are on the small side but for the business traveler its just right bathrooms are adequate  nothing plush but it works rooms are comfortable and clean with a work station with wireless connectivity and a small flat screen tv staff is accommodating and courteous there is a restaurant in the hotel which does have room service would i go here for a vacation with the family  probably not as like i said the rooms are a bit small but for business its a great place to stay while in the houston downtown area,4.0
excellent staff and rooftop lounge highlight very nice hotel,the staff were as comfortably gracious as they could be just wonderful  friendly willing resourceful etc the room i stayed in was on the 6th floor with a great southerly view although not the full ocean view advertised nevertheless a very nice room the rooftop lounge has an excellent 360 degree view and is open for use even when the loungebarrestaurant is not open a great quiet retreat i would definitely recomment it,4.0
overrated overpriced and undersized,"the location may be good but thats about it what a pretentious overhyped ripoff this place might seem appealing to someone whos used to sleeping in closets for  35000 plus we had a room with no view that might have been 160 sq ft if that no coffee maker a glass wall on the shower so you could see through to someone on the toilet from the bed what the heck is that all about ive been in airplane bathrooms that were bigger and the glass wall was creepy 
when i asked the too cute and too smarmy clerk at the front desk if we could change rooms she told me that i was registered for a queen standard and thats what i was given and if id like to explore upgrade options blah blah blah the hotel temperature was in the mid 70s same in the room set the ac unit a little lower in the room it goes on and off every five minutes and the ac unit is located directly behind the headboard its just nuts
skip this joint completely unless your some desperate foreign traveller with no other options and no regard for comfort and value",2.0
dont take your coat off  you wont want to stop,"we stayed at the park central between march 25th  29th 2005 we were a party of four and as two of of party required separate beds our travel agent called and asked about booking two rooms as we wanted one with twin beds and our booking was made on that basis we booked two rooms one with any type of bed the other with twin beds the four night break cost more than 2000 when we arrived we were told that we had been allocated two one bedded rooms we queried this and to cut a long story short the lovely check in clerk called the front desk manager and after quite a wait a portly man popped his head out tapped a few keys on the keyboard and in true little britain style said the computer says no well actually he just said no in fact he said we dont actually have any twin rooms in the hotel none at all not none available none at all so i asked why had they had accepted our booking when they couldnt fulfil it and he just shrugged his shoulders i said to him that it was showing as a confirmed booking for twin beds and he said that no beds are guaranteed until check in i asked him to refund our money so that we could find a hotel with twin beds and he said no  we had made a confirmed booking and it was non refundable
we were allocated rooms on the 25th floor one was quite large the other very small in the small room they added a rollaway bed  all this money and one guest gets to sleep on a rollaway it could have been worse as when we were checking in a couple with two strapping teenage lads were also told that their room would have one kingsize bed and a rollaway i wonder how dad got on sleeping with his lads
the largest of our rooms seemed to have a bathroom designed for disabled access the bathroom was approximately 10 x 8 and one third of this was tiled with a shower there was no curtain and the floor was very uneven and cracked when the shower was used it flooded the whole room and from the skirting board and carpet in the bedroom it was clear that it had flooded reqularly the shower was really weak and very disappointing
in addition to the shower there was a sink and toilet no shelves no counter no cupboards in short no where to put a toothbrush or toiletries there was no where to put this in the room either so it was put in with the television as this was the only place with a shelf
the room itself was comfortably furnished and on the surface clean but the maid service was lacking  no towels no coffee windows left open on cold rainy days the small room had a very small bathroom but it was fully functioning
the room was also very noisy  we turned our air conditioning off but it was still really noisy it sounded like an aeroplane going over head and there was constant traffic noise the smaller room very small was at the back of the hotel and much quieter this is my fifth new york visit and this was definitely the noisiest hotel
we were on the 25th floor and the lifts were hopeless it took about 15 minutes to get a lift and there were often long queues with lots of queue jumpers
there was obviously a leak from the ice machine as there was a wet patch on the carpet around four feet wide around the machine this got larger over the time we stayed there 
room service seemed very expensive  french toast was 18 plus 185 tax plus 350 delivery plus gratuity and omlette was 20 plus the tax and delivery
i thought that this hotel was over priced and the useless front desk manager whos only function seemed to be to tap the keyboard and say the computer says no was a definite negative 
if there are only two of you and you can get this at a reasonable price then i think that you would be happy with it",2.0
friendly homey and comfortable experience,this was the second time i stayed at this hotel and will return again in october i have been truly impressed as for convenience couldnt be better i own a condo one block away and have my car parked there condo is rented so you are my second choice i have told many friends already about the hotel they are going to mention it to their friends when coming to town its hard to find places to stay that are as nice and priced right,5.0
great downtown hotel,totally lovely small hotel the rooms are small but stylish and cool the staff is great and the best part the fantastic room to the right of the lobby an honor bar library service and a charming hidden garden,5.0
wheres the staff,this hotel always seemed grossly understaffed at one point in the middle of the day there was no one at the front desk no one at the bar no one at the restaurant no one at the transportation desk and no one to answer questions we had difficulty arranging to get on the free shuttle although the shuttle drivers were very helpful and kind at one point we had a mini fridge in our room when we returned from dinner with togo bags there was no mini fridge in our room,2.0
great place to stay,my family stayed at the old town inn san diego for three nights the hotel was really a great place to stay at an excellent price of 75 dollars a night we stayed in a deluxe efficiency room which included a gas stove microwave and a fridge the continental breakfast was excellent and included fresh fruit cereal juice milk coffee and tea and we were even able to make our own waffles using their waffle irons they had free highspeed internet access in the lobby but i was able to access it from my room several yards away the pool was nice as well the only noise that was somewhat a bother was when the neighboring rooms used their water i could hear the noise in the pipes in my room rather clearly other than that this was a great place to stay and at an excellent price,5.0
location comfort and service,"after having this hotel booked through a conference organizers we arrive to boston only to know that we had a loss in the family the hotel management immediately allows us to cancel the rest of our booked stay at no cost we spent a night in the back bay 
a spotless room with a fantastic contemporary bathroom and very comfy bed the view was to the other hotels building but they say that you cannot have everything right",5.0
excellent hotel in a great location,"wonderful hotel in the university district with plenty of bars  restaurants nearby 
the staff were very helpful we had to drop our rental car downtown so they arranged for us to be picked up and bought back to the hotel the staff were also able to offer their reccommendations for places to drink too
the room was very comfortable  well equipped a perfect end to our honeymoon",5.0
overpriced in need of renovation very disappointing,"we just stayed 4 nights in a corner king deluxe room with city views  very disappointing supposedly some rooms have been renovated but we were obviously not in one of those see picture of the ac vent and blackened ceiling attached for example although we paid the same way too high price which does not feel very fair the room though not in disrepair feels grim and outdated out of the early 80s carpet and wallpaper give a quite depressing touch to the room and to the hotel in general since they are as outdated in the corridors and elevators on top of that the city view we were expecting was mostly a direct view of another building on one side and a view of the ugly roof of the adjoining mall on the other side see pictures not worth the extra bucks for sure
and to top it all during the whole weekend there was a convention of japanese anime and video games which attracted hundreds of young people dressed up in all kinds of crazy outfits who wandered around in the lobby and other parts of the hotel from morning till late in the evening  too bad for you if as a guest you wanted to enjoy the lobby and the garden the best parts of the hotel from what weve seen looking for the zen experience of a traditional japanese hotel",2.0
fine but location a little suspect,"stayed at this hotel overnight on may 15th and 16th 2012 checkin went fine and smoothly but for whatever reason the temperature inside the hotel was extremely warm my room in the north tower was also unbearably warm and the windows were unopenable as well took some time to figure out how the airconditioning unit worked but even then it still took 34 hours for the temperature inside the room to drop to 70 degrees by the time i took a walk around the block that the hotel was situated on it had become dark outside during that walk i saw various homeless people sorting through the public trash bins drinking out of paper bags and loitering around in the various alley ways on an adjacent block lined with abandoned and rundown properties there were three individuals on their soapboxes using loud and gruff voices to broadcast some type of diatribe inaudible over a loud speaker system decided right then and there to head back into the hotel and spend my time in baltimore during the evenings inside the hotel and not wandering around
regarding the hotel itself the bed was comfortable and offered plenty of room for one person the room was clean the television was good and easy to use the shower was fine but the toilet backed up during its second flush i notified the maid that there was a problem with the toilet before i left for the day and the problem was resolved when i returned in the late afternoon one evening i used the hotel gym only used the elliptical unit and thought it was a good setup the pool wasnt opened yet but i noticed a maintenance worker one afternoon patching the pool bottom and putting a fresh coat of pool blue paint so i woudnt be surprised if it was going to be open soon 
the restaurant was just okay there were plenty of televisions broadcasting a number of sporting events which was fine by me but the meals that i had fish  chips one night chicken parmesian the next were only average at best and i wouldnt be a regular patron at this restaurant if i were dining for pleasure there was also a foul odor like a floor mat that gets gets saturated with detritis and moisture that becomes rank over time think stinky foot odor that came from behind the bar
the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful all around so no problems there
overall some good elements and overall just an average experience",3.0
great hotel friendly staff make for a wonderful stay,this is a very nice little hotel it is more along the lines of the european hotelsfairly small but the staff make up for the size even in a 5 star hotel the staff dont measure up to the staff at hotel lawrence it is conveniently located near the west end  not far from reunion tower they have a shuttle van that will take you anywhere in downtown dallas the restaurant that is in the hotel is absolutely fabulous they have the best chicken fried steak i have eaten in years their mashed potatoes are really home made  not just mashed baked they actually put butter  milk in them the lasagna  the fishin cream sauce were excellent they actually make their own cesare dressing  it is great i cannot rave enough about this little place called the founders grill  the value for the dollar is super cant wait to get back to dallas  eat there again,5.0
very comfortable,we called this place after not liking the best western or the days inn around here they gave us a really great deal the only downside is the 20night inciental charge they charge you when u check in u get it back the staff was very friendly tamika checked us in and she was very knowledgable about the hotel it was very clean and the breakfast was awesome i would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the market center area i would stay again myself,4.0
nice hotel pleasantly surprised would recommend,"i stayed here for one night while attending a conference at the hotel i noticed the mixed reviews and was a bit leery but was pleasantly surprised with everything
check in was quick and smooth room was nice good size and comfy beds main drawback would have to be thin walls but other than that i would recommend or stay here again as well the front desk was always helpful bellman was great as was valet 
we had a nice buffet breakfast and dinner at delmonicos was amazing",4.0
just average wouldnt want to come back,"i must have missed the renovations on this hotel that i keep hearing about or maybe my room just didnt have them upon checkin i was greeted by an extremely friendly clerk who made the experience great from the begining although it quickly went downhill from there
upon arriving into my room it immediately smelled musty so i turned on the air conditioner which took a while to finally start up the decor was not redone therefore it had a very dated bedspread wallpaper bathroom the mini fridge was a nice addition if it would have worked however the dial was broken off when i called the front desk to come fix it i was told that someone would be up in a little bit to fix the problem however no one came after 3 hours i called again and was told the maintenence person was busy and probably wouldnt be able to get to it today i told them not to bother then seeing as i was only there over night
the bed was hard and was not entirelly clean the shower worked decently however it couldnt keep a consistency between hot and cold just keep switching itself back and fourth 
i went out for the night and when i arrived back to the hotel i found almost no parking there was literally one space left and it was an extremely tight fitting space the next day at check out i called the front desk and asked for a little extra time because i had lost something i was told i had 10 minutes i found the item within 5 and when i was leaving the room to head to the lobby i saw a clerk coming up the stairs checking to make sure i had left the room i know he was checking because i heard him use the walkie talkie to say my room had finally been cleared
this was one of the worst hotels service wise i have every stayed at and i would never return to this location unless some staff members were changed out",3.0
hidden gem perfect for my seminar great access to midway and mploop,"i stayed here for a seminar at dearborn station which was a short walk away much appreciated coming from ga in feb i used freq flyer miles so was given a premium room with a very useful refrigerator the bedding was extra comfy and the staff were very responsive when i called about a rattling heating grate  came immediately and took care of it i always have earplugs and eyemask for city stays but didnt end up using eyemask good blackout curtains and used earplugs only first night
transportation easy ride from midway to hotel on the cta hotel website suggests using orange line to lasalle and van buren but with rolling luggage the library stop is much easier because it has an elevator from train level to ground level easy ride to theater district at night also",5.0

nice location near emp and space needle,"you dont need a car  avoid the 20night parking surcharge easy walking distance to major attractions and neighboring restaurants  around 5 or 6 blocks duck tour across from space needle was a hoot nice hotel with very comfortable and wellequipped room 42 lg hdtv with some hd channels good free wireless internet microfridge in room very comfortable king bed and large enough to sleep on corner couch small bathroom and tiny closet 
took free hotel shuttle to pike place mkt on a friday evening and had trouble getting back they said they had been there to pick us up but that we werent there that did not happen took 2 calls from a wellknown location and more than hour waiting there on the street after we were done with dinner and ready to return to the hotel each time we were assured of a pick up time that long passed before the driver arrived with no explanation or apology other than i just started my 11pm shift and that he wasnt aware there was a problem docked them a star for this probably should have deducted more but it was an overall good stay
if departing seatac airport take the free hotel shuttle to the train station downtown to get to the airport 250 one way its 17 miles away and through seattle traffic by car or taxi give yourself plenty of time it took nearly an hour from hotel to airport by shuttle and train and we were shocked at the security lines on an otherwise quiet sunday am we nearly missed our flight arrive early",4.0
amazing one of the best hotel stays we have had,stayed for three nights in mid august from the moment we arrived we felt pampered and well taken care of by the concierge and butler staff the staff was always available to arrange great dining choices and to advise regarding activities we took advantage of the hotels complementary car the rooms are spacious and extremely well appointed the view from our huge deck was breathtaking we will be back for sure,5.0
very pleasent stay,"we spent a werk in nyc and stayed at the mansfield hotel overall we are very happy with the hotel the room was a junior suite with a front room and a seperated bedroom both rooms had ac and tv there is also free wifi available a little disappointing was that the basin in the bathroom was very small
the location of the hotel was great its in the 44th street next to 5th ave also the timesquare is only a 7 mi walk away

a bit of a disappointment in san antonio,"we booked this hotel after reading all the reveiws as we arrived  pulled up to the hotel i was surprised at the location it was on the othere side of the interstate  adjacent to some pretty derelict property it was close to downtown so it wasnt the distance but we were two woman travelling together  like to walk it just didnt feel really safe the one way they suggested was to walk thru the parking lot underneath the interstate thru a fenced area the underpass under the freeway was well lite as well  we didnt encounter any problems but it just wasnt what we expected it was far enough away that we didnt run back to the hotel to drop off shopping or rest before dinner which we normally would do i would not book this hotel again  would pick one closer to the riverwalk
the breakfast was great  the hotel was well maintained  clean the breakfast staff were friendly  diligent  keeped everything clean  well stocked we did not find the front desk staff overly helpful im sure the website shows that there is conceirge service i dont consider the front desk staff to be a conceirge serviceit was extremely lacking they provided incorrect information  asked about an outlet mall  they said there was no shuttle service from san an  there was they recommended taking a cab to another mall  which cost 20 each way we were told by a salesclerk in a store to go to the same mall using the transit which was 2 they would not make dinner reservations for us one night at 10pm as they said the restaurant would be close  to come back in the morninngwe called from our room  made our reservationsthey just didnt have that happy outgoing helpful attitude that we are used to encountering with conceirge services or even front desk staff
another experience we didnt appreciate no washrooms on the mainfloor so we had to go up to our room the door key for some reason didnt work it was probably after 10pm we returned to the front desk no one was around we called the front desk from the lobby phone it rang foreverno answer i finally knocked on the door  the front desk staff came out obviously from a very sound sleep he did fix our door key so all ended well but it was a bit frustrating 
the room was spacious clean  comfortable there was quite a bit of noise from the interstate you could hear traffic increase each morning some morning we were woken by i think a garbage bin being emptied
also on the website it shows an airport shuffle it is not free in fact it works for one person but if there a two its cheaper to get a cab we asked at the airport  ended up taking a cab which is around 30 one way i think they said the shuttle was 19 each way per person 
we stayed 6 days in san antonio which was too long we didnt find that there was enough to do in the city and we are not country  western fans",3.0

whole experience was just aweful,i normally dont bother with reviews but this stay i felt needed one i always check out trip advisor reviews before booking with a hotel and they have never steered me wrong however this hotel was a huge disappointment i usually take the bad reviews with a grain of salt if there are numerous good reviews well i should have listened to the bad this time first off all staff that i encountered except for a young lady that had only been there 4 months were rude we booked through expedia which advertised free shuttle free continental breakfast at a special rate which was 3 less than the sign outside the hotel when we arrived we were given a room on the ground floor on a saturday night at about 8pm we were surprised at the amount of people out in the halls and outside but we figured it would calm down no such luckfolks were making all kinds of noise all throughout the night there were a lot of young couples making out in the parking lot and with the mirror over our bed and the extremely small room it made me wonder if there arent a lot of hourly stays here the bed was hard and uncomfortable and with all the noise we were not able to sleep one wink the small uncomfortable room with the hard bed did look clean but there was something splattered all over the mirror headboard like soda or food or something that made me wonder if they really cleaned the rooms ever we were only staying for one night so we could leave the next morning for a flight to disney world when we checked in we told the girl that we had requested the shuttle service for 7am she said ok and wrote our names on some sort of list not a problem also asked what we would have to do to get the shuttle back to the hotel and she replied just call the hotel and well take care of it ok well the next morning no one was at the front deskwe later found out he was the one setting up breakfast when i asked him about the shuttle he did come out and call the driver to wake him up i also asked him if we just called them or how the process worked to get picked up he said to just call he was very short with everyone he spoke to he was very strange cant describe him anyway there were 5 of us already out there waiting for him he was supposed to be out there at 7am the driver finally showed up at 730 to give us a ride pretty darn tired looking he must have also not gotten any rest from all the partying going on in the halls the night before anyway we got the ride to the airport and there were no lines so no problems getting to our 930 flight on time the real problem was when we returned i called the hotel to get the shuttle back to where my van was parked all of a sudden they have no record of me even staying there then the lady on the phone finally finds it and says oh you booked through expedia so you shouldnt have been allowed to park and shuttle without upgrading to our price she also called my price extremely discounted even though it was only 3 less than the advertised price on their signage and it was i am pretty sure the crappiest room they had available after hearing i might have to pay double what i paid to get back to my van which was already parked at the hotel you can imagine i was pretty irrate so i did mention to her that i got a discounted rate for a crappy room she insisted that i had to pay the fee that the 2 employees before should have mentioned to me and made me pay before i left my van there she asked that i pay that fee when i got back to the hotel and since i finally agreed she did go ahead and have the shuttle man pick me up since he was already there picking up another couple but she was pretty rude about it also if you have small children you should know that the shuttle is more of a small minivan i didnt think to bring a car seat for my two year old son bc i didn know this next time i will ask the hotel what kind of shuttle anyway i wouldnt recommend staying here at all but if you still decide tojust know that you will probably pay way more money than advertised i watched a couple check in that morning and the cost ended up being 70 without any kind of park and ride service the sign outside advertised 4999 but with taxes and fees the front desk guy told them it was 70 anyway this review may not sound too bad to some and i guess i should have known better than to try to save a little money however after these reviews i felt like it would be a good place to stay for one night boy was i wrong nothing was as advertised and how can it be a good place for one night when everyone is making noise all night no consideration at all it was a horrible way to start our vacationi should have just waken up at my house at 3am and driven 3 hrs to the aiport myselfit would have been better than paying for this hotel and not even getting to sleep there just not good experiencesi just want to save others from having similar experiences oh and the lady that made me pay extra was dissing expedia like crazy and i have always booked through them with no problems whatsoever on the positive side since we were standing in the lobby for 30 minutes waiting for the driver of the shuttle busi did manage to get a bagel to eat and get some fruit loops and juice for my son the breakfast didnt start until 7 a little after though on the weekends im wondering if those folks with good reviews stayed during the weekday and if that makes a difference maybe an upper level larger room i dont know but i will say that when we got there i kind of felt like the lady who wrote she didnt feel safe in this hotel it was just the people hanging out in the hallway and the sketchy people walking up and down the road around the hotels i kinda wondered if my van would be safe but the front desk lady just said not to leave anything valuable in it and that they hadnt had to call the cops for any incidents in about 4 months,1.0
cowpatties in cowtown,"one might guess from my title that i dislike fort worth but its one of my favorite places in the world my tolerable stay at country inn and suites only slightly spoiled the ambiance and thats saying something for the charm of cowtown my suite was clean and adequate but the refrigerator was very flimsy and small there was only one small closet and the tvs were pretty old however these are minor problems
 ive stayed in a lot of places and have never complained even at one hotel in corpus christi with a lot of mirrors and a lot of cockroaches reflected in them not to mention the flimsy deck that felt as though it might give way at any moment just like the decks in the tier of rooms next to me with one continuous hole through them from floor four to floor one did the victims survive i wonder but i digress back alas to the country inn and suites
 where were my freshbaked cookies nowhere to be seen the unhappy story begins however when i took my first shower after adjusting the water pressure to a painfree level i noticed that most of the shower ended up on the bathroom floor and the fan did nothing to prevent condensation i had to mop up the floor and dry the mirror and counter afterward the bathroom towels were all damp this might have been prevented if a real shower liner had been put in the room instead of a flimsy curtain that was never meant to be waterproof and clung to me so much i was sorry i hadnt made my introductions before we had gotten so intimate the trick i discovered was to thoroughly wet the bottom of the curtain so that it would leave me alone and hug the side of the tub instead this helped to keep some of the water in the bathtub and not on the floor it was late at night however and after my aquatic workout and cleaning the bathroom i was thoroughly wrung out only an exasperated call to management was going to make me feel better or was it
 after explaining the problem to a desultory nightclerk the phone was handed to a brisk and efficientsounding manager she couldnt have sounded less concerned with my problem and informed me that somehow my showertaking skills were inadequate all of the rooms had these socalled shower curtains and she really saw nothing wrong with them the fault lay in my woeful showertaking skills not their faulty curtains why she had never heard of such a problem i suggested she take a shower herself in one of her wonderful bathrooms with the fan running and see if she didnt herself have a miserable experience since there was a convention in town and i couldnt reward managements attitude by finding another hotel i remedied the problem by buying my own shower curtain the next day i had to make a second call for dry towels
 on the positive side the rooms were clean maidservice was friendly and prompt and the pool was very pleasant latenight swims were a real pleasure just dont expect to stay in the shower for more than a few agonizing minutes and expect the bathroom to be drenched unless you ask for room 120 the only room with a real shower curtain",2.0
good hotel  you get what you pay for,"i stayed at this hotel for a week in late august it was my first stay but i anticipate staying here again in the future my company has a corporate agreement with club quarters so i dont have much of a choice on where i stay while in chicago on business 
the only dings i can really give this place are regarding the front desk and the bedspillows on several occasions during my stay the front desk staff was more interested in discussing their personal lives than helping customers i expected the standard issue hard bed and thats what i got what i was not expecting was the condition of the pillows when i went to lay down the interior contents of the pillow moved to either side of my head and my head was literally laying on the bed so whats the point of even having pillows by piling both of them on top of each other and kind of rolling that into a ball i was finally able to get a marginally acceptable pillow
as others have mentioned this hotel is not going to put you in the middle of the action of downtown if you dont mind some walking in order to get to michigan avenue millennium park etc then youll be just fine because its more in the business area of town it can be a bit deserted on the weekends and after about 89pm on weeknights but i walked around by myself on numerous occasions during these times and felt perfectly safe
as for the room size i had a room with one queen bed it is small by us standards but if youre in downtown chicago you shouldnt be in your room other than to sleep and shower anyway this hotel caters to business travelers so if youre looking for a spacious andor luxurious room then should look elsewhere overall i had a pleasant stay at the hotel and for the price i had to pay it cannot be beat for downtown chicago",4.0

nice hotel with good breakfast,i like the location here as well as the breakfast the only negative was the fact that they dont have an indoor pool or hot tub they do have a mini bar next to the front desk which is nice for a late evening drink breakfast was good with french toast eggs sausage links hot oatmeal pastries toast and several different miks and juices i would stay here again,4.0
had a great time at the restaurant  bar,the service in the hotel was exceptional we especially felt cared for at the restaurant bar having missed our reservation time at our restaurant due to the difficulty in getting a cab we decided to head into the hotel restaurant for drinks and dinner that was the best part of our night not only did bill the gentleman behind the bar make us delicious cocktails and entertain us with funny stories but he also recommended a couple of restaurants for us to try while in town the dim sum restaurant that he recommended was the highlight of our culinary experience while in san francisco thank you bill,4.0
great view but not what id expect from a hotel this nice,i stayed here for 3 nights while taking a class for work at the hotel the hotel itself is very nice and the patio and view of the harbor were great however charging for wifi is ridiculous and i was surprised that there was no refrigerator in the room at a hotel this nice also housekeeping didnt replenish the washcloths when they cleaned and they didnt take all the dirty towels even though we laid them right beside the tub 250 for a 20 oz pop always kills me seriously what a rip off maybe thats just boston pricing but in ohio thats a lot no pop machines on the floors meaning i had to travel from the 10th floor down to the lobby to get my 250 bottle of pop concierge was very helpful and the free shuttle to the airport was nice we used the shuttle at one point to take us to the airport where we took the subway to get into the city theres no inexpensive option for getting from the hotel to the city since you have to get across the harbor the water taxi was neat and we did that once but it was 17 per person round trip regular taxi was about 25 one way not sure how much the subway was but it was in between the water taxi and regular taxi pricewise overall very nice hotel but i was surprised about the wifi charges and lack of the little perks youd expect at a hotel such as this,4.0

outstanding helpful staff,my husband and i stayed at this hotel for 4 nites we were very comfortable in our quiet room on the 3rd floor which was very spacious with a small kitchenette we enjoyed the heated pool and jaccuzzi we were able to walk to a 24 hour family restaurant and convenience store closeby to our surprize when we asked what bus to take to the attractions they said we will sign you up which time do you want to go and we will pick you up they even one nite drive us down to old town so we could tour area and have dinner if you are traveling without a car this is the place to stay you are close to public transportation but staff will van you to your point of interest if you plan to go to san diego to go to sea world zoo old town or other attractions this is your hotel also they are family friendly offer aaa discount and other discounts we stayed for less than 70 a nite this is a must stay,5.0

fitzpatrick grand central hotel new york ny,"i stayed in this hotel two weeks ago for 3 nights having read good reviews and got an amazing deal the hotel was very comfortable the bedroom was large and the bathroom was enormous every facility i wished for was available the beds were the most comfortable that i have ever slept in in an hotelit was very difficult to get out of it the staff were very helpful and friendly and the concierge performed a miracle getting us a taxi to the airport the only critisism that i had was that the water pressure was rather weak in the shower 
the location of the hotel is brilliant it is so easy to access all of manhattan easily from here
i will definitely stay in this hotel again when visiting new york city",5.0
the best red roof inn ever  but still a red roof inn,"this is the best red roof inn i ever stayed at the rooms were recently updated to a trendy modern decor some of the rooms have a nice view of downtown the location across the street from the convention center is nice the arena district is within walking distance theoretically the short north is a 5 min drive
on the downside it is still a red roof inn the bed was hard the linens were rough and the towels werent soft  but everything was clean
breakfast was prepackaged muffins bagels and bread you could grab some toast and coffee but dont expect much you could walk across the street to the convention center food court for breakfast or lunch
parking is an issue parking is 10 a day which is cheap but it is across the street there is a few spots to unload by the front door in addition the parking is not in a garage and your car is susceptible to break ins however this is pretty much par for the course in downtown hotels you could park across the street in the convention center parking lot
i wouldnt mind staying here again if i needed a place downtown",4.0
best spot to stay in fort worth,"we stayed at the omni fort worth for three nights in july 
could not have been more pleased with our selection our room was a premier king  this gave us a large room with a wall of glass nicely furnished with a beautiful bath featuring a fabulous glass enclosed shower the amenities were fabulous the staff could not have been nicer  one day when we had mistakenly left our do not disturb sign up for the entire day we requested fresh towels in the evening imagine our surprise to return from dinner and find the entire room had been cleaned and refreshed
room service was fabulous valets were always eager and cheerful and we cannot say enough good things about the comfort and layout of the rooms
there is a great fitness centre with all the best equipment  and downtown fort worth is an easy walk away for dinner and shopping yet highways are easy to access to travel to other parts of the city
truly the best choice in downtown fort worth",5.0
hotel pics are deceivingnasty with bed bugs,the room was infested with bed bugs was moved to a different room at 230 am management ramonemgt was rude and pretty much disregarded the incident the second room had three twin beds for four adults and it was filthy i guess this was punishment for complaining the mattresses were covered with mattress covers and the seams were duck taped not sure if that was so the bed bugs couldnt get in or so they couldnt get out at 6 am we decided we had enough and decided to leave asap spoke with the gentleman that checks bags he was very nice and offered us large trash bags to put our luggage in so we didnt take any bugs home with us also he indicated that he strips before he leaves work even his socks he fears he will take the bugs home thats sad when the employees feel this way we asked for our money back they said they will file a report and if the exterminator determines it is in fact bedbugs they will refund our money but if it is any other insect they would not these people are nuts since it was friday the exterminator would be called on monday they have no intention of letting me know of the outcome not that i expected they would but i did call the health department first monday morning so i know a formal complaint was filed i will never ever ever stay there again room 1570 15th floor,1.0

nice location rooms are ok,this is a simple clean friendlystaffed hotel in an excellent area if you are coming to chicago to shop it is a block or two from the mag mile and a nice safe area the only 2 detracting items for me are that the rooms are a little on the small side which i was traveling alone so it wasnt too big of a deal the other item is there is only a single elevator so depending on your ability to hoof it on the stairs you can sometimes wait awhile if you were on a low floor probably not a big deal ditkas restaurant is connected to the hotel and the breakfast area is in the restaurant must be a sharing arrangement,3.0
a very nice place to stay and a great location,"when we found a great deal via travelzoo for labor day weekend we pounced on 2 rooms for our family turns out it was not just a nice hotel but the staff was super friendly and the location was quite convenient to navy pier millenium and grant parks the magnificent mile and plenty of other sites that we walked to during our holiday stay
we had asked for rooms near each other on the same floor but ended up getting adjoining rooms so that was awesome we ate in the main lobby restaurant a couple of times in the morning for convenience more than anything else and though it was just a bit pricey the food was terrific and the breakfast buffet plentiful and quite tasty
my only nitpick is the 13day for internet  cmon folks thats a bit absurd thank goodness the parking was free as part of our booking
i would stay here again in a heartbeat great experience",5.0

if you want to stay in a nightclub,"if you like the type of boutique hotels then this might be for you but this hotel was not for me
first of all the entrance is very stange there is no sign to say that this is a hotel so you would walk past it and you wouldnt know what it was the doorman that took our cases had no idbadge so we didnt even know if he worked there or if he was going to steal our luggage
check in was no good either because we were on our honeymoon we asked for an upgrade the receptionist agreed but said she didnt have the room ready yet and did we mind waiting we were ok with this as were getting an upgrade however if we had known that we would have to wait over 2 hours then may not have bothered the thing was that she said because one of the lights was out in the room she would have to let an engineer go and check it out before we could go in the room anyway after 2 hours we still hadnt got our room so went up to reception and they agreed we could check into our room but told us there would be someone coming up to fix the light but for the whole 5 night stay the light was never fixed so we wasted over 2 hours for no reason not happy
i did not like the dark lighting throughout the hotel it was like a nightclub and the music in the lift was very stange 
the worse thing was the hotel bar the bad attitude of the serving staff really got up my nose and you could only sit in certain seats if you ordered the most expensive drinks on the menu what a load of rubbish it wasnt even busy i was not going to tip them after their rudeness
so overall would not recommend this hotel the rooms are very small we had a studio room and you couldnt swing a cat in it the staff were either rude or unhelpful one good thing was the conceierge they had really good knowledge about the city but that was about it i am sure there are much better hotels in new york",2.0
convenient and comfortable,i stayed here a few days with my family on spring break the hotel was clean and the staff assisted with anything i needed the bed was soooo comfortable that i didnt want to get up in the mornings there were a lot of families in the hotel but it was quiet nonetheless i would recommend this hotel if you are going on a family vacation as fiesta texas and seaworld are close by and it is easy to get downtown to attractions around the alamo,5.0

after getting a great deal on hotwire and then finding out the name of the hotel i called to make sure that the three rooms we were getting were connected to each other and two of them had king beds  both of these requests were very important since we are traveling with a baby  we were reassured that it will be all good they also set us up for an early checking 10am they said unusual but a nice bonus we thought
we called to confirm that our rooms were ready and as we requested half an hour before we arrived 12pm and all was good
when we arrived however we were informed by a very unapologetic person at the counter that 1 one of our rooms wasnt ready as they were overbooked  we were fine with that at first but didnt turn out to be ready until way after official checkin time2 only one of our rooms had king sized bad  we were willing to live with that 
 and 3 rooms werent connected  that part wasnt ok at all but on top of it she basically was telling us that there is no way we could have requested it she was actually implying we were making it upthere is nothing she could do she said just like thatsince our hotel was prepaid for all 4 nights we couldnt just leave so waited for a manager who finally got us two connecting rooms  the third one was nearby not connected which was ok i guess it had a view of some dirty roofs too and wasnt ready for hours we were happy though that the main issues were resolved eventually  after probably at least 20 minutes at the counter with a crying baby manager was trying to fix the issues as she felt parenting comradely checkin was off putting i asked what they can do for us to compensate for this drama and they told us wed get a free breakfast the next day and a fridge microwave  both were nice gestures although it took 3 calls to actually get that and the man who brought them finally didnt have a splitter available so microwave had to end up on the floor odd
wireless was a real pain and i needed t to worki travel a lot  as u can see i usually leave nice reviews  and wireless works fine in this case i had to call them several times a day  they had to reset blamed my computer and refused to do anything once and in general it was a pain finally figured out that their nets confuguration couldnt play nicely and consistently with my works vpn which isnt normally a problem waste of time
last complain when we went down for breakfast in the morning we waited 15 minutes in a half empty restaurant its more of a bar size and then waited 45 minutes for our food which was pretty good wait stuff was nice to us but very neurotic as even my 2 year old noticed  they did yell at some couple that they had to wait until seated and i mean bark odd we were thinking maybe erected is a convention or something in another room that they are catering
otherwise the place is good  beds were comfortable hot tub was nice on a rainy day  pool wasnt heated though as their website says but that was ok
there is food within walking distance  a great thai restaurant across the street fast food bagel shop starbucks view from the 2 rooms was over the highways and hills behind it it ws pretty nice actually
its not really in mission valley but i liked the location anyways",3.0
great location comfy bed otherwise lackluster,we had a great nights sleep at this hotel and its location was very convenient near chinatown close to union square fishermans wharf north beach ghiradelli square etc otherwise the hotel was quite lackluster especially for the price the room was very small and the bathroom was beyond teeny the staff was responsive  even when we stopped by the front desk around midnight to request more bath towels our bathroom was only equipped with one when we checked in the bellhop had a strange altercation with a cab driver while trying to help us get on our way to the airport he was discreet about it and it was fine but was representative of the entire stay safe fine and perhaps a bit too much hype considering the price,3.0
my familys favorite,"we have stayed at the mediterranean inn at least 5 or 6 times in the last few years and have never had a bad experience the location is great especially if you have kids as its close to the seattle centre science museum childrens museum space needle and you can take the monorail downtown and to pike place market the area is also great for walking around  there are good restaurants grocery stores a used book store 
the last time we stayed here aug 2008 i booked a king sized bed and found it very comfortable  on previous trips weve had a queen bed that was a bit too small for us also you can request a room with a window seat made into a bed if youre traveling with a small child probably not good for those younger than 3 as its fairly high off the ground my 6 year old loves it the one downside is that the windows arent the best and let a good deal of street noise in but i cant say that its bothered us much",4.0
so good we visited it twice,"i have stayed in this hotel twice and on both trips it was excellent suite type hotel with a very small modern lobby and staff that were second to none this hotel would suit anyone who thinks location and accomodation is paramount over room service which most people wont use anyway
we have always stayed in a two bedroomed suite but have seen a one bedroomed suit which was equally impressive
the kitchens are well equiped and a supply of breakfast goods are provided top tip when you need more provisions just ask as they are not automatically replenished
i will use this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone",5.0
an unfortunate place with unfortunate service,"this hotel is lots of potential and very little delivery the primary problems with the hotel although there are a good number of them seem to pale in comparison to the bad service rendered at the hotel i guess the best way to look at it if youre considering a stay is this why is a waterfront hotel and resort run by the hilton company with tons of amenities in a great location rated so low in tripadvisor ratings for the city think about it
 first off some of the positives
nice bay location thats up against a nice city park with a great jogging path and lots of room to play and relax whether its water or land you wish to play on
good coffee and lighting in rooms and having a minifridge is always a nice touch
pool area is nice and complete with lush landscaping bar service hot tubs plush towels security and firepits that make for a really nice area
good comfortable beds and quality air conditioning that truly works
now a dose of reality about this hotel that makes you feel its all facade and no heart
poor housekeeping my room featured a kleenex and an india palace or some such restaurants receipt under my pillow
while rooms have nice furnishings they seem to be getting old and a bit worn down around the edges my room featured some chips on the wall a shower curtain coming off the rod an inconsistently flushing toilet and a remote control for the tv that only had part of the buttons working
outrageous prices in the snack shop lets just put it this waythree dollars for a 12ounce container of milk
overpriced parking for 22 per night when its nowhere near downtown and is set next door to a park with hundreds of free spots money grab also features an overpriced restaurant overpriced bar and overpriced internet for your overpriced websurfing pleasure
 lastly and most important of all this place simply has disgustingly poor service particularly at the front desk i checked in with a supervisor and had some questions about my benefits as a frequent stay member because he was unable to satisfactorily answer my questions he suggested we call the main answer line for hilton after several minutes of holding a lady came on the other end and after hearing my questions and concerns offered a statement ill never forgetsir we appreciate your loyalty to hilton and would like to offer you and your family a weekend to look at one of our hilton grand vacations destinations no jokeshe was trying to sell a customer with a question and a complaint a timeshare condo my question was never answered the guy at the desk kept shaking his head and smirking and they had a customer whose stay had been ruined before it began
 im sure with the right manager and staff that this hotel could rise up and be great unfortunately it appears that will not happen anytime soon",2.0
great location,we loved the location to the wharf ghardelli the trolley and the bus to golden gate park great rooms and service will got back,5.0
cant wait to go back,"although it has been months since our stay this hotel stands out as one of the best hotel experiences i had in the past three years
the location was great for us as we took the train from boston and walked the several blocks from the train station with luggage it was interesting on the busy sidewalks so you might want to cab it but we love to walk as it helps us to get our bearings and really get to know a city
as we approached the building we could see scaffolding and both groaned in anticipation of construction noise what a pleasant surprise then to be told by the front desk that our room was not ready so they would bump us up to one of the coveted and more expensive upper floors i wasnt sure if we should do this i have a terrific fear of heights but the woman at the desk said we definitely should go for it as the room was great she was right and i am so glad i made the move we had a beautiful spotless mini suite with a gorgeous view of the city i was with my husband and he really appreciated the separate kitchen which was fully equipped we didnt use it much but it was great knowing we could on a future trip
the king size bed was comfy and the linens high quality and spotless the bath was elegant with fluffy towels and high quality bath products i do believe we had to pay extra for internet which always kind of annoys me but that was truly the only bad note in an otherwise perfect stay
there is a little breakfast place right next door but also plenty of other choices if you feel like wandering a bit 
we stayed for three nights in february which was a good time as far as pricing went and we lucked out as the weather was unseasonably warm and beautiful 60 degree days hope to do this again next year",5.0
very friendly and helpful staff,i loved this hotel we got there 3 hours early and they went ahead and let us checked in everyone was so friendly and helpful yeah the items in the mini bar were overly expensive 3 for a can of soda but i guess that is normal the rooms were on the small side and not at all what i imagined they would be like considered the hotel is called the la mansion i was very disappointed when i saw our room but after awhile it kind of grew on me our room had a view of the pool which was beautiful but it was lould i heard kids screaming every morning which was not plesant to wake up to over all i enjoyed my stay at this hotel and i would stay here again if anyone over 21 reads my review and desides to stay here  you have got to go down to the hotel bar and have a mojito,5.0
clean quiet and a nice breakfast,classic courtyard facilities clean quiet and good value for the money breakfast was extra but at a reasonable price location is only about 20 min from the charlotte nc airport convenient to gas stations shopping and restaurants stopped here on our way to and from asheville,5.0
gorgeous indoor architecture,i stayed here at the end of august for a business trip i was very pleased with most all aspects of the hotel the mediterranean feel of the cental courtyard is absolutely beautiful and the view from the glass elevators made the morning trips down to breakfast and to the start of the meetings so enjoyable the rooms were very spacious and clean the only problem was that i could not get the room to a comfortable temperature even when i turned the ac off completely it was still cold but since i didnt spend much time in the room it wasnt a big deal just bundled up good at night the breakfasts were great i didnt use the restaurant although it seemed kinda small but did spend about an hour in the bar area one night when i just couldnt seem to wind down the bartender was very friendly and attentive one other minor complaint and this is at no fault of the hotel was that my room was on the front side of the hotel and there was roadwork being done on baymeadows that started about 9pm each night kinda noisy and there were some flashing yelloworange caution lights that made their way through the curtains if youre planning a trip in the next week or so i would call the hotel to see if theyre still doing roadwork there and if so request a room towards the back of the hotel the only other complaint would be that the side door that i used to enter and exit the hotel seemed to be the general smoking area for the hotel staff and any other guests being a nonsmoker it wasnt very pleasant to have to walk through the blue cloud of smoke every time i left or came back after the 3rd time i just started using the front entrance instead,4.0
very nice hotel  almost excellent,for the price a great option rooms are spacious clean and well decorated very comfortable bedding service was friendly albeit a bit amateurish especially when discussing restaurant options the shuttle service not only takes to and from the aiport but also was availalbe to take us back and forth from local restaurants saves a lot on cab fare my only complaint which is a pet peeve of mine no free wifi in the rooms  only in the lobby,4.0
hotel for the classics,"so i had a week in nyc and i was looking for a place to stay and pay less than 200 a day 
this hotel is located right in the middle of everything it is near the subway it offers free transportation in the city and most of all it has a great bar and lobby
the room was a bit small but it was clean and tidied everyday the bath was amazing with gliss products",5.0
2nd stay wasnt that great,"my husband and i spent two nights at the hotel adagio this past weekend after having a really nice one night stay late last year we were planning to visit their tapas restaurant cortez this time but it was closed due to some sort of major underground plumbing issue our room was nice enough 6th floor view facing a brick wall on the back side of the building it sounds boring but was nice and quiet with very little street noise we like the hotel adagio for the modern decor bathroom supplies bed cleanliness etc everything was fine until saturday morning there didnt seem to be any hot water even after running the tap for awhile sometimes older buildings have issues so i was being optimistic anyhow we finally decided that there wouldnt be any hot water so we called the front desk they told us that it was a problem with the water pump and someone was working on it but had no idea when it would be fixed the person on the phone didnt seem very interested in explaining the problem to me or very concerned either eventually after a few hours the hot water was back but not for long
we got back to the hotel from an afternoon of shopping wanting to freshen up before dinner and found that there wasnt any hot water again we called the front desk and they told us there was still a problem with the water pump and it was being looked at again again they didnt seem too concerned or apologetic which we found really annoying we never did get any hot water and had to suffer with ice cold water not fun 
sunday was a little better one out of two of us had a hot shower which was an improvement we were never offered any kind of perk for the inconvenience just a halfhearted sorry about that we werent expecting to be comped for the two night stay but perhaps a voucher for a future discount or maybe comped parking most of the staff was pretty indifferent to the problem and we were really disappointed at their attitude
anyhow in the future we will not be choosing the hotel adagio opting for another of the many boutique hotels in sf",2.0
fantastic location and great service,"stayed there for a few nights recently the location of the hotel is fantastic it is near 711 grocery store great restaurants night life the train i walked everywhere the service was great you feel welcome from the moment you arrive i have requested an early checkin and this was not a problem 
free internet access is standard here as well as access to fitness facilities the bed is very comfortable comparable to westins heavenly beds the bathroom is on the small side and bath products are not high end the room was clean 
one thing the walls were not thin but the door was i can hear peoples conversation in the hallway and the elevator my room was close to the elevator if you are a light sleeper that could be a problem however i was up early and returned late so that wasnt too much of an issue for me cannot comment on the food as i did not eat there they do have a 247 pantry available and a starbucks on premise",4.0
there are better choices  hilton brand take note  1 night was enough ,"i seldom travel to this areaso i depended upon a colleague to choose our hotel location based largely upon convenience of travel to our meetings
checkin was all about getting the credit card imprint and never a smile or welcome word spoken to the guest efficient  yesfriendly not  
rooms are poorly constructed paper thin walls  minimal noise reduction  which mean guests can clearly hear doors opening closingslamming and plumbing sounds at all times of the evening and night conversations can be clearly overheard thru the walls in the adjoining rooms bathroom fixtures are completely outdated and frankly peaking a complete joke 2 star properties in 3rd world nations are much higher quality and appointed the television in the adjoinging room could be easly listened to from my room at 0500 am 
elevators are pathetically slow  so if you are inclined  take the stairscarpets are sadly worn out and soiled
frankly speaking  hilton  shame on you for allowing your brand to appear on this dump this reviewer felt completely cheated by the poor condition of this property",2.0
great place location and staff,my husband and i took a quick trip to nyc and selected to stay at the chelsea pines inn based on the great reviews we read on tripadvisor the reviews were correct this inn is fantastic i would highly recommend it it was so easy to get all around the city from the chelsea pines i love that it was right next to highline park and the subway as everyone else has said the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms were reasonably priced and quite nice if you are looking for a place to stay in nyc look no further,5.0
okay place for one night,"the place seems a bit worn down but okay for the price
was concerned about the area  but we had no problems security wise
breakfast was poor  and the service was bad almost nothing there",3.0
this is hotel is a pile of crap,they say that they remodeled this hotel 4 years ago it sure hasnt been remodled good the elevator is a piece of crap that barely works i hit the floor button and 3 different buttons lit up the wall paper is ugly the thermostat and workout machines in the work out room dont work there are bedbugs and the bed feels like a rock i dont think there is any stuffing in them if you want a nice view inside or out dont expect to get one at this hotel i was getting some ice out of the machine and the coke machine started acting like someone put a dollar in it and i was the only one there once i left the room i heard a drink fall out i went back and there was nothing there its a really old hotel so its probably haunted the tv is horrible im surprised it works though because nothing else in the hotel does there isnt a free breakfast they dont allow pets they cant make the hotel any worst i cant get any wifithis hotel is an expensive piece of crap if you ever want a good hotel near here there is a really nice courtyard marriot like less than a mile from here i usually want to stay in the hotel rooms once i get in them i wanted to leave once i got in there there is even like a 20 charge per night if you pay with a debitcredit card this hotel better not be rated over 2 stars it shouldnt even be rated 1 star,1.0
hidden treasure in the city,i must start of by saying that i am a born and raised new yorker that conducts business and lives in the city therefore i pretty much know my way around to say the least i booked the doubletree because i had family and friends coming in from out of town and wanted some peace and quiet that i could only find in lower manhattan to my suprise this is by far one of the best hotels i have stayed in the rooms are up to date and very modern but the best part of the hotel is the helpful and very friendly staff luisa at the front desk checked our whole group in and made sure we were all on the same floor she welcomed in such sweet and graceful manner  which is hard to find in ny  needless to say we had a great time and felt right at home she also gave us some cocktail drink coupons for the lounge that came in handy for us  thank you all for you hospitalty ,5.0
nice and convenient to riverwalk,my husband and i stayed in this hotel with our 6 month old the staff was very friendly and assisted us with any questions or things we needed the room was clean and a typical residence in room small kitchenette comfortable bed clean bathroom the maid service was prompt and good there is a charge for parking but that is consistent with all hotels in the area we did enjoy our stay and would stay there again,4.0
suspect customer service,rooms were of a satisfactory standard as youd expect from a holiday inn hotel but the service provided by the front desk staff was variable as the evening  nightshift did not work to the same good standards as the dayshift i overheard others in the lift making the same conclusions if you can save any issues you might need help with until the dayshift is on duty,2.0
great location and a really nice hotel,i booked this over memorial day weekend and got an insanely low 62 rate on priceline the location is in the heart of center city with restauarants theaters and historic sights all within walking distance philly is a great city to explore on foot and the hotel is perfectly central to any place one would want to get to the lobby was lovely and the front dest was very pleasant when a charge for the hotel bar was erroneously put on my room tab they immediately took care of it the room was spacious and clean and even the maids were very friendly great weekend in philly,5.0
best bang for the buck,was looking for a cheap place to stay during the sox world series and chinatown sro fit the bill perfectly as the other reviews say the night staff doesnt speak english that well but i managed to communicate the only annoying thing was the main doors are lock after midnight so you have to wake up the night door man to let you in but other than that the location is old chinatown and is quite lively in the wee hours i also liked the fact that the red l line was only a block away which run 24 hours great for bars  rooms werent the best in chicago they are similiar to what you can expect in a motel 8 or similar level motelhotels overall i give the place a b for value and location,4.0
deserving of rating,the staff at this hotel are great without exception nothing was too much trouble for them from start to finish we were there for 7 days and everything was wonderful this trip was for my 60th birthday and the hotel staff made sure it was a trip to remember i would recommend this hotel to any age group,5.0
excellent location friendlystaff  good atmosphere,this was our first stay at alexander inn we really appreciated it  very convenient locaton good breakfast comfortable room and very friendly staff this will be our place to stay in phladelphia should we decide to come back,4.0
quaint even though its in the city,"this was a bit of a splurge for me but well worth it i would definitely stay again but for only a short time since it was a bit expensive 
 the staff was phenomenal i was very worried about parking since i drove around for 15 minutes and didnt see anything as a last resort i drove right up to the hotel and they had someone right there to take care of everything i cant remember if i paid anything for the parking but it wasnt unreasonable i didnt have to worry about a thing after that was eagerly taken care of for me 
 the hotel was beautiful and luxurious the elevators and hallways were small but gorgeous we were greeted by the friendly staff and taken to our room expeditiously the room was a nice size and had a perfectly clean decent sized closet the bed was very comfortable and there were chocolates and cookies left nearby for us to indulge in they were quite good too the bathroom was awesome the shower was huge and the entire bathroom was immaculate the decor was very romantic and there was just the right amount of furniture in the room it was cozy i wish i lived there 
 when we were ready to go out it was such a pleasure the neighborhood is safe and so beautiful great place for a romantic walk at night there was a park nearby and the housesbuildings were wonderful to take in there were also plenty of restaurants and shops nearby within walking distance to enjoy",5.0
great location,enough distance from the noise of times square easy walk to most things spacious suites reasonable price for location minimal contact with staff is ok unless you need ritz or four seasons treatment loads of local places to eat delis stage and carnegie are 12 blocks away rays pizza around the corner acceptable breakfast at cafe metro across the street great being able to get up early and sit in the suite without disturbing spouse fitness club is adequate great having wifi everywhere including fitness club,4.0
love the marriott on the water,we have been stayed at this hotel as business guests and on vacation we have enjoyed all of our stays,5.0
excellence in the theater district,"i am grateful to other tripadvisor reviewers who helped me and my wife to consider this hotel we stayed six nights and were very impressed by the size cleanliness quality and location of the michelangelo new york
location is excellent it just north of the crowds of times square but close enough for a five to ten minute walk to most theaters if you use the subway three different stations are within one or two blocks 
if you want a quality hotel that is wonderfully quiet and well managed in the center of the city this is the place staying at the michelangelo makes us look forward to our next trip to new york city",5.0
would definitely go back,we spent spring break with my teenage daughter and her friend our suite had a family room with pullout bed for the girls and my husband and i had a kingsize room with balcony the bathroom was separated into the toiletshower and vanity area there was an entrance from the family room and the bedroom into the bathroom the grounds have 8 different pools  we chose the adult only pool and the kids went to the bigger main pool the grounds are awesome  especially if you like to walk for a workout  lots of hills the restaurant at the top of the hill was fabulous even if you just go to the terrace room for drinks you can enjoy the view if you are a hilton member you get an awesome buffet breakfast for free every morning workout room did get a little crowded in the mornings but there is also a great walkinghiking trail right next to the resort and tennis courts it was also a short 20 minute drive from the airport,4.0
outdated old dirty,"i am surprised that they can call this hotel a marriott sheets and pillows are the only item that has been updated in the past few years the maroon chair is badly faded and brown from all the dirt on the chair room and hallway smells dirty no free breakfast for rewards members on weekends front dest staff not capable lost my room key went to front desk to get another and gave them my information it didnt match what was on the computer 
i stay about 100 nights per year in marriotthilton chains this particular hotel is worse than a holiday inn express",2.0
perfect location for center city exploring and touring,"friends and i were in town for whiskey festival held within walking distance  it was very clean comfortable and the corner rooms are huge  ask for a higher floor with a view of city hall and the towers  quiet and worth the money
we walked to most of what we wanted to including reading terminal market for a helpful hangover breakfast thank you down home diner
valet was helpful as was housekeeping for extra towels",5.0
a very pleasant surprise,my husband wanted to set my girlfriend and i up for a nice girls night out in downtown san diego but all the hotels downtown were booked for a conference he ended up booking us at the town and country because of its convenient location to downtown the room was very and the bar at trellaces treated us very well we were planning on eating out downtown but the food at the restaurant looked so good we decided to eat there it was a great choice after a great night out downtown the bed at the hotel slept great i would go back there anytime the weather was not warm enough to go swimming but the pool area looked great,5.0
location location location,"arrived on the 15th february to some of the coldest tempretures i have ever experienced 20 centigrade with the wind chill
on arrival at the hotel found the staff to be very helpfull and polite
had a room allocated on the 18th floor one of the few smoking ones room was a petite double and while it was small it had all that you would need and was warm even though the heater had two tempretures cold and hot
however we did expierience a problem with the shower as the tempreture would not adjust from either cold or scalding hot we did report this but nothing seemed to happen at first eventually the maitenance manager came to the room to show us how to work the shower
he did agree in the end that there was a problem and apparently in most rooms on the 18th with the water tempreture to this end he got us moved to a double room on the 10th floor with no extra charge the hotel also gave us a free breakfast for the upheavall of moving
apparently there are 273 starbucks in new york and you have one in the hotel bar area great if you dont want to go out first thing however this is only open from 711am  but with a branch 100 yards up the road its not a problem if you want a late night one to take back to the hotel which they dont mind well they never chalenged us on it and plenty of people were bringing drinks in
location of this hotel is great about a 10 minuite walk to times square and again a 2 minuite walk to grand central terminal
5th ave is just 5 minuites walk away where you will ceratanly shop till you drop
however on the subject of shopping the woodbury common shopping outlet is a must you can get a bus from the port authority bus terminal on 8th ave which will take you directly there journey time is roughly 1 hour once there you would not belive the prices timberland boots 5999 current exchange to uk 3000 all the big names are there and you will not get stuff as cheap as this in the city even in the big stores like bloomingdales and macys the ticket does cost 3999 each to get there but the savings far out weigh this people who were in the know who must have been before took empty cases with them
the concierge in the hotel will book tickets for this trip for you
we will return to nyc soon with a spare case virgin alow you to check 2 bags for each pasenger up to 23kg each even when flying economy and for location will probably stop at the roosavelt",3.0
overall very good but location could be better,the service here is very helpful on every level from the valet to the concierge extremely convenient to semiupscale shopping and dining the location could be better however in terms of austin nightlife best suited for business travel or family visits not so much for the hip young crowd,4.0
great family hotel,stayed in early july with my two teenage children we had a suite that comprised of a full bedroom and a pull out bed in the living room and a full kitchen we were pleasently surprised to find out the kitchen had a full cooker the hotel was clean and the staff very friendly there is a great supermarket across the road that sells everthing the area is very safe a short walk to the nearest subway station but you can easily walk to the main sites,4.0
great place for a stopover at the houston airport,"we were on our way back from honduras and spent the night in houston to catch an early flight the next morning we booked the la quinta inn and suites because they had a shuttle to and from the airport everything was great the shuttle driver picked us up promptly after we called the desk clerk greeted us with a smile the shuttle driver recommended and drove us to a great restaurant in the area and also picked us up when we were done with dinner the room was very nice and clean we had to catch the shuttle back to the airport before 7 am so the desk clerk put muffins fruit and coffee out early for us so we could have some breakfast before we left all in all it was a
pleasant experience for us
on a previous trip we had stayed at a hotel just across the street for the same price and had a horrible experience so this was a pleasant surprise will stay at la quinta from now on",5.0
highly recommend this hotel,"i have stayed here on several occasions and have always been very pleased with accomodations and staff i am a hiltonhonors gold member and usually get the upgraded suite room but even the regular rooms are extremely nice
the only complaint i have is that the food isnt the best in the world but that is often a complaint at doubletree hotels the cookies are great though and realistically there are plenty of places to eat in houston and if you dont want to drive the hotel is always willing to give you a ride in one of the hotel vehicles",4.0
basic  clean no frills very desirable location,"we stayed 5 nights recently at this hotel we read reviews beforehand and were expecting modest accomodations at a budget price location was excellent close to everything we planned to do front desk allowed us to check in early 200 at no extra charge and were given a quiet room with updated furnishings on the back side of the hotel the room and bed were quite small but adequate bathroom and shower were small but updated plenty of hot water not much of a view from the backside but we werent in the room except to sleep anyway upon checkout the front desk held our luggage for a halfday at no charge til our flight left 
there were endless restaurant choices and especially enjoyed the italian cuisine in nearby north beach lots of daytime tourists and foot traffic in the area during the day we plan to stay here again",4.0
you get what you pay for,we booked a room via the internet at the mithila because it was inexpensive centrally located and carried a three star rating on one site we thought it would be an adventure staying in a charming europeanstyle hotel located in the heart of downtown san francisco instead we found a decaying old building that had been covered over with a coat of cheap paint and cheap carpet it stank of mildew and hadnt had a good cleaning in quite some time although the pillow cases and sheets had been changed the pillows were old and stained as was the mattress and quilt truly not an invitation for a restful night im sure the hotel fulfills the local health codes but if you are looking for even a bit of comfort and a clean bed i would suggest you look elsewhere we stayed long enough to use the phone to book another hotel that we had used before and then checked out the staff said they had to bill us for three days although the policy was stated on several websites as a one day penalty for late cancellation however after a complaint to the web service that we had booked through our money was totally refunded,1.0
great location and wonderful staff,my family has stayed at this embassy suites more than once and always have a good time here it isnt in the heart of the tourist area but it is well located to places all over memphis there are great places to eat very nearby and the food at the hotel itself is always tasty the atmosphere is comfortable and the rooms are always clean the staff has helped us when things came up out of the blue and we have never had a single complaint,5.0
perfect for one night,its hard to write a review on a place you only stayed in for one night but heres what we noticed while we were there the staff at the front desk were friendly for the most part but not above and beyond in any way for dinner they of course recommended the hotel restaurant which looked very nice but we were in chinatown and wanted to enjoy a restaurant that reflected that we went with tazias a recommendation from the nicer of the front desk clerks and loved it parking was good it was a bit pricey but you are staying in a large city so thats to be expected i did like that the parking was in the same building as the hotel rooms were basic nothing wowed us but nothing greatly disappointed us either we could hear everyone that passed by outside our door but this didnt seem to be something that was so bad it awoke us so overall we were pleased we would definitely do another overnight here but would probably look to somewhere with a bit more of a wow factor if we were staying in philly longer,4.0
overpriced no hot water fridge broken 10 bucks to park on a 300 dollar room,overall the room was fairly clean but was way overpriced got up at 7 am to shower and once in the shower found the water was just luke warm not even close to hot stuck a couple drinks in the fridge and was wondering why the werent getting cold upon moving all the desks to check the plug found out it was unplugged the fridge made so much noise i ended up unplugging it again i paid 28400 for a room with no hot water when i told the desk woman she handed my complaints to the gm who was on the phone he told her to take off the 1000 parking fee how generous i told him that wasnt enough for no hot water and he never hung up the phone to speak to me just said i should have called to have it fixed i said i was already in the shower and he said that i should have got out and called what a rude idiot i checked out and stayed at the days inn across the street 11800 a night and just as nice of a room as the holiday inn one other thing they advertise and i was actually told you can walk out the hotel and your in the national arboretum not so its 4 blocks away at least and its not in a neighborhhod you want to walk 4 blocks in my suggestiondays inn far better value and easier access with a store dunkin donuts and a burger joint on the same side of the road plus a resturant in the hotel itself,2.0
simply outstanding,excellent locationsuch attention to detail we had a fire experiencenot a big dealbut the way they handled it all and the special perk for taking good care of us during the evacuation lasted just minutesearly evening love staying in a hotel that absolutely caters to its guestseven in the craziest circumstancesthank you for a fabulous timestaff was amazing right in the middle of seattle a short jaunt to the marketand the shopsso fun,5.0
great hotel perfect locationfriendly staffgreat value,stayed 2 nights had great time checked in by erica who was so efficient friendly  helpful had requested early checkin as flight arrived 9am  room was ready room was large modern  bed so comfortable caught bart from airport  hotel was close by the station also market street trams took us to waterfront area convenient location for price charged would highly recommend this hotel,5.0
everything i expected and a little unexpected,as a road warrier ive come to reply upon hilton properties in general and hampton inn in particular for a decent room an adequate breakfast and a fair price i chose this property due to its proximity to downtown seattle while i got what i expected the usual hampton inn experience this hotel offered more and reminded me of my two favorite hampton inn properties in chicago and manhattan the front desk staff were beyond polite always asking what they could do to help me questions were answered promptly and never did i have to wait for an answer the room i had a king suite was large very clean and quiet because of my positive experience my family is now considering this hotel for our home base for our summer 2013 vacation highly recommended especially if you are going to visit the space needle or the emp museum oh and the monorail which you can catch at the space museum will take you to within 4 blocks of pike place market a little gem offered by the front desk staff and employed by me,5.0
parking was ridiculous,the hotel room was small but clean if you stay one night though you pay 44 dollars for parkingquite the rip off,3.0
loved the chandler,hotel was in a great location the room was small but very clean and comfortable the bed and linens were very comfortable  the bathroom was great room was quiet overall a great place,4.0
not the worst place in the world,i agree with other reviews that says it is loud the train literally runs about 100 feet from the building but i think that is mostly because the windows are really old and you hear all the noise coming in from them by newly remodeled they mean paint coat number 862 on the walls poorly applied i might add talking to them on the phone is just about pointless i called twice and both times seemed like i was just bothering them in person they were much friendlier the bellman was quite nice actually of course housekeeping was knocking on my door starting at 8am to clean the room which was kind of annoying every half hour i would not recommend this hotel if you have any allergies especially to dust my room really could have used a thorough cleaning but it was livable for one night i did not have any bed bug issues so that was good the bathroom smelled of stagnent water which i believe was the shower curtain the tub was really deep had the tub been clean i definately would have relaxed in a hot bath but there was slight coat of scum on it so i decided to not be a human scouring pad but i guess in comparison to other rates in the area it was cheap if you are looking for a hotel experience this is definately not your place if all you need is a bed to sleep in for a few hours and a hot shower you should be fine just bring a pair of earlplugs unless you are a really sound sleeper,2.0
very good for the pricebut they need to dust a bit more,"got a very reasonable priceat least 50 less per night than the best deal i could find on expedia its an older refurbished hotel so yes the rooms are small but theyre livable plus theres an open living room area on the mezzine that has free wifi so if you do need room to stretch you can do it there the bed was very comfortable and i found the rooms and hallways to be very quiet i think the older construction actually helps in this case unlike the newer hotels that are basically metal and cinder block the hotel pacific actually seems to have thick insulated walls its also within good walking distance of shopping and pikes market i was in town for a conference and it was about a 10 minute walk to the convention center
the drawbacks a crotchety elevator that stopped working once or twice and the hotel could use a good scrubbing from top to bottom while the rooms were generally clean the curtain sheers could use a washing im currently looking at a visible layer of dust on the light fixtures in the hotel lobby not a deal breaker but they should break out a ladder and take care of details like that",4.0
great hotel,"pricelined this hotel for 87 plus tax per night very happy with the hotel there were three of us travelling together in two rooms and as i snore really loudly i got a huge double double room all to myself great views of boston from the room nice controllable aircon smallish bathroom though actually the same size as the one i had just stayed in nyc really comfortable beds and nice large lcd tv the rooms have all been renovated in the past year and one of my travelling companions had stayed in this hotel before and confirmed that the rooms are much nicer now they have put a really nice rain type shower in and upgraded the furnishings
the lobby is very plush and check in was smooth elevators were a little slow but not a real big issue i used the boston common parking lot which was about 34 from saturday evening to monday morning it would have been only 22 but we failed to get up before 8 am to get the car out in time we took a cab back
lots of shopping opportunities around the hotel and not too far from the t station although we took cabs mostly everywhere
we managed to hire a speedboat from a guy at the harbour for 75 gas for two hours which was enough really we took it quite a way out to sea and actually to the furthest lighthouse it was also cool to see the aircraft taking off and landing at logan whilst on a boat
all in al the hotel was pretty good especially for the price and i would definitely stay there again",5.0
wil be our first choice for future trips to nyc,we stayed here with our family and another family in june 2011 it was our first trip to nyc the staff was very helpful especially the person we spoke with to make the reservations hotel was clean and very nice inside we were surprised at the normal room size after what we had heard about new york hotels the mattress was great considered buying one essabagel is just a block or so up the street and certe pizza another favorite was just around the corner great part of town and within walking distance of st patricks bryant park and other attractions we even walked from theater district to the hotel but that was quite a trek our friends who come to new york on business usually stay somewhere else but after staying with us said theyll switch to this hotel now definitely our first choice for any future trips,5.0

spacious and clean,had a suite in 34th floor fantastic felt like an appartmentwe liked it so much that we spent every evening there after walking in manhattan all day just picked up pizza in the neighbourhood and relaxed we had weddinganniversary and mention that got champagne when we arrived nice we also checked out 1 instead of 12 oclock we are very satisfied,5.0
excellent hotel inexpensive and well situated,"i really like this hotel when searching for a hotel in ny i looked for one that was fairly central manhattan and reasonably priced ie as cheap as possible and i found exactly that in hotel alexander so as to keep the cost down we opted to have a triple room with a shared bathroom in the corridor i was nervous about it as i dont like sharing bathrooms with other rooms usually but i neednt have worried there were three bathrooms for the floor and in 5 days i didnt have to wait once  at least one was always available 
the hotel is spotlessly clean even the communal bathrooms the room was very clean and the lovely cleaner always tidied it up and put things away for us so we always had a nice clean room to come back to at the end of the day
the location is really good as well we were within walking distance to central park and it is a nice area lots of wholesome looking people
the price was right as well we only paid 506 for a four person room for 5 nights so for each person it didnt cost much more than a youth hostel
i would definately recommend this hotel and cant think of one bad thing to say about it",5.0
fantastic hotel,we visited the hollywood roosevelt in november 2003 for five nightson arrival we were upgraded to a fantastic suite on the 11th floorit was very spacious with two kingsize bedsand a huge bathroom which contained a wet room and a baththe toiletries were plentiful and of excelent quality we had a view of hollywood blvdand could see right into the forecourt of manns chinese theatrewe were also very pleased to find that we had a perfect view of the hollywood signthe hotel was in a brilliant locationtaxi to warner bros studios was 10the tube to universal studios is a minute walk away and whilst on the tube is only a five minute ridemels diner is a great place to start the day breakfast is well recomended and not too expensivenext door to mels diner is the max factor museum which contains loads of hollywood costumes and make up worn by the stars for examplemarilynjoan crawford we were travelling with our 10 year old son who found the outdoor heated pool fantasticand went for a few moonlit dipsi would reccomend this hotel to anyonethe sheer history of the hotel is overwhelming so dont let other reviews put you offi would love to go back someday,5.0

where my guests stay,i recommend it to visitors who are on somewhat of a budget good value for price right in middle of the action of downtown denver swimming pool attracts guests and locals alike the place lobby bar has excellent service thanks shelley  tracey and incredible nachos it is extremely understated and certainly not pretentious if you want luxury and extreme pampering try some of the luxury hotels within walking distance like all hotels downtown it is close to convention center caters to foreign bus tours so the volume will vary with the conventions but they staff accordingly,4.0
another nice stay at embassy suites,the family visited dc for the weekend and embassy suites was our home away from home for one night with two small children the room worked perfectly that is the beauty of embassy suites no matter where you go their product is consistent it is a good hotel great location and the staff was plesant to work with the property has been updated the room was clean and the furnishings are in nice condition the hotel itself is located in a nice neighborhood and within easy walking distance of dupont circle and lots of neat shops and restaurants downsides inlcude poor shower pressure parking its expensive unless you get lucky and find something on the street which we did and a 12 internet charge come on really you will give clients endless drinks at the managers reception and all you can gorge breakfast but charge me 12 for internet any hotel that charges internet fees loses a star on their value rating yes you get a lot but you do pay for it with an all inclusive rate so they should include the internet and all would be excellent overall we were quite pleased with our stay and will gladly stay here again,4.0
your home away from home,"i interviewed 6 different extended stay hotels in the fall of 2011 i picked this one as the perfect location you are truly in the midst of every imagineable shop and grocery store the proximity of the dallas no tollway george bush 635 and 121 is an easy get to anywhere
the staff truly went beyond expectationsfrom the moment you check in with kalina quick and not painful to freddie who will come and fix anything if needed to the cleaning staff your stay will be very comfortable i was there for 3 and 34 months while waiting for my new townhouse to be built
i would defintely stay again and hope that the staff were recognized as very friendly and efficient in their jobs
thanks for everything

an oasis for the business traveler,i have have experienced two exceptional stays at the orchard garden and recommend it highly it is truly an oasis for the business traveler offering a high level of service and beautiful accommodations the staff is very helpful and friendly making it even more of a pleasure the fact that it is also a green hotel makes staying there even more of a priority for me,5.0
a great place to stay,this was the perfect place for us to stay while visiting la we were going to be out all day and just needed a place to sleep the manager of the hotel deserves an award he was so nice and gave us good advice there was free coffee in the office one morning i was leaving at 6am to go somewhere when he called me from the office to remind me to get my coffee this is not an upscale hotel but it didnt cost me much to stay there and the rooms were clean i would go back,4.0
great fun for the kidsno doubt,we went to the hotel to experience the carribean cove attraction my 6 year old loved seeing all the slides and pools when we showed him the brochures he was very eager and got the 180 to go via gift certificate prerequested b day gift this is a great way to have a child this age make the big splash yes the costs are over priced but as a true fun for kids idea the hotel scores very high the check in was short  5 mins on a thurs and check out a bit longer 12 mins on fri am but the rooms were clean  the noise not bad at all the water park is tremendous fun for any kidmy 3 year old was soaked from head to toe as well and loved being in the kiddie korner my 6 year never had more fun beats the zoo after the 1st time there the museums the moviesetc only the state fair might equal the fun quotient carribean cove offered to all of us the slides are absolutely over the top drenching excitement no let down yes 1 adult should be more watereager and we did not buy any overpriced food sold there we drove out and ate for cheaper the arcade was very impressive though another cost to bear and the lifeguard staff was hands down great the proximity of the rooms is ultra convenient  the quiter hot pools are a welcome break from all the rahrah action of running up to the slides i loved just floating around the wavepool riverthat was really enjoyable the fewer small children a parent decides to bring the better i think but its a nomiss love ya kid reward or gift the accomodations are very comfy yes its clean and friendly our family bought modest souvenirs  drove 30 mins to get there each way we plan to go back family of 4 in march after irs season or unless it becomes a christmas wish somehow,4.0
wonderful service and location,"my husband and i went to the adagio to see if they could help us the response we received was absolutely outstanding we would like to compliment kier for her wonderful assistance she managed to find us a lovely room including a complementary bottle of wine every person we dealt with at the adagio was friendly and effecient i cant speak highly enough of this hotel and would absolutely stay there again

stale bread extremely minimuffins and donuts do not make a continental breakfast
no transportation from the hotel to the nearest metro front desk is more interested in getting you a gypsy cab unmetered taxi percentage cleaning staff do not know how to read a do not disturbed sign

a wonderful experience,"a friend recommended the hotel drisco to us during our stay in san francisco we could not have been happier with our accommodations from the moment we checked in to our departure four days later we were impressed with the service from the suggestions of local restaurants to directions to various sights the staff was extremely helpful bob at the front desk went above and beyond in making sure our stay was enjoyable not only was the location of the hotel wonderful but all the extra amenities added to the pleasure of our stay the hotel drisco is a place we would highly recommend to our family and friends and we will definitely be returning soon

please dont stay here,i attended a conference so was assigned to town and country from the moment we got thereto the moment we left it was a nightmare check in and check out was total madnessthey dont assign rooms so you take what you can get my first room smelled of mold and mildew so bad i asked for a transfer that took two days and me pitching a fit wthe manager to get a new room organization and cleanliness were terrible the grounds were lovely  but that was it we ate at the terrace and it took almost 2 hours to get our food  then they said they ran out of the fish i ordered we ate at charlies and it took 30 minutes for a waitress to begrudgingly wait on us it was a horrible experience  i would have left after the first day if i wouldnt have been assigned to the hotel for my conference the work out room and internet were an extra fee,1.0
better than averagein some aspects,the room they gave us was really small it was clean and the bed was just okay there were no amenities but did have wifi and there were dishes and pots and pans and silverware in the cupboards the plus to this place was they actually provided dish soap and even bisquick and butter thats not normal i have never seen that before the staff was nice they originally gave us a floor on the second floor and saw that we had children then moved us to the bottom level also the original room they gave us the door didnt shutlock,4.0

convenient place to stay for an early morning flight,my husband and i stayed at this hotel for one night prior to taking an early morning flight back to washington dc we arrived late on a sunday evening after traveling from vancouver island where wed been staying but the bar was still serving the full dinner menu even thugh the restaurant was closed we just had sandwiches but the food was good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant the hotel isnt fancy but it met our needs for a clean affordable place to stay our room was clean and the bed was comfortable the only problem we had was that all the numbers were worn off the buttons on the tv remote and it was challenging to figure out how the tv worked without them the hotel is within walking distance of the airport but we took the shuttle because it was pouring rain the next morning they told us that the shuttle runs every half hour but it was running more frequently than that when we left due to the demand we booked at the nonrefundable rate on the website and the price was very reasonable i was concerned that it might be noisy but we really didnt hear planes once we were settled in,4.0
great hotel and staff we stay here often,while visiting colleges in chicago we stayed here the suite setup made it great for traveling with a young adult the doorman was the best gave us great info each time front desk people are not nearly as great as the bell and door people but still good this is our home away from home when visiting our chicago college student love the tea the rooms are comfortable bathroom great,5.0
great location  some might find it a bit too achingly cool,"the location is great the hotel is a little impersonal i had a standard room which was fine for 1 person  but would have been snug for two people sharing there is a handy diner across the road where you can have breakfast at a fraction of the rate that the hotel charges also the reliable duanne reade is on the corner of the block and handy for supplies usually found in the minibar at extortionate rates stock up there for mineral water and snacks 
when i checked out i was apparently randomly charged for using the mini bar which i never do when questioned the charge was waived immediately with no quibble almost made me feel that they do it to everyone on the off chance that most people wont query it check your bill otherwise would have no problem in staying there again",4.0
you get what you pay for,my husband booked this hotel because he used credit card points and our stay was free little did we know that the rooms were going to be just as small as the other hotel we stayed at in nyc on this trip we really just felt out of place in a sea of international tourists and youth trips never again,2.0

great stay will definitely use again for trips to seaworld,based on reviews on tripadvisor we decided to book at this hotel for our trip to sea world with our three kiddos it was perfect we got a twobedroom suite and i was worried as we were right next to the pool but we never heard any noise from that area the rooms were clean and wellappointed the beds were very comfortable and we loved having the kitchen for meals and heating up leftovers the breakfasts were very hearty which kept us from buying too much expensive food right off the bat at seaworld and one day we had the afternoon meal which saved us some more money we were just a few minutes drive from the park which meant we did not have to deal with long rides in the car and it was super hot so this was really good or any traffic i thought this hotel was an excellent value and we will definitely use it again when we go to visit seaworld,5.0
excellent stay in a great hotel,"we stayed here for 4 nights in august and were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the hotel the excellence of its staff and the brilliance of its location
upon checking in we were allocated a very small but well maintained and presented room the clerk on the checkin told us the room would be small which we were expecting but that he would check us into a bigger room for the last two nights of our stay when the hotel was not full to capacity this was without any prompting from us and this excellence was pretty much representative of the whole of our stay 
both rooms that we stayed in were lovely and everyone on the entire staff were super friendly and helpful the roof terrace afforded great views of the city and the complimentary coffee and internet pc in this area was also a really nice touch
i really cannot fault this hotel and would recommed anyone travelling to nyc to consider staying here its location is brilliant too nicely situated between midtown to the north and greenwich villagedowntown to the south
if you do stay here the lyric diner two blocks south from the hotel down 3rd av does amazingly tasty and good value breakfasts in a traditional diner style the total bill including tip for two excellent breakfasts each consisting of eggs w bacon and home fries fruit cup toast coffee and water was 15 and we really didnt need to eat again until the evening

beautiful hotel that nickels and dimes you to death,"we stayed at the hotel january 1617 for the cubs convention the hotel is beautiful and for the 20000 crazed cubs fans running around this weekend they manage to keep it pretty spotless other than the view weve had some years view of another wing of the hotel or of a train track weve had no compaints about the rooms we have stayed here every year for fifteen years and while service has been exemplary as others said its tip please every time you turn around
january 2008 we also stayed at the hotel the chlorine concentration in the pool was so high that my three children had fullbody rashes and refused to get in the pool on the second day and for a 12yr old and two 9yr olds to refuse to go in the water is highly unusual i talked with other parents whose children has the same problem we have been to several water parks whose pools are also wellchlorinated and never had a reaction like this i let management know during our stay and then followed up with a phone call and internet complaint once we returned home they explained that there might have been a problem with the chlorinator but they offered no compensation or even an apology letter rather disappointing for someone who holds one of their silver hilton honors member cards
this year just my husband and i stayed not bringing the kids our room this year was 312 with tax and charges the first year i stayed here it was about 175  prices have gone up considerably but the 8 bottle of water and the 1695day charge for internet access are over the top we chose to decline both the pavilion restaurant offers a buffet only during the convention at 1620person with a family of five i dont relish spending almost a 100 on each meal buckinghams the steak restaurant apparently closed down recently as it still shows on all of their inhotel literature kitty osheas a pseudoirish pub is a nice place to eat with good prices you can get a good burger there for about 9 if i remember correctly during the convention the hotel also offers some breakfast items at the bar  you could get a bagel for 5 or orange juice for 8 get the picture i could purchase two gallons of orange juice for what they charge for a 12oz bottle thats not markup  thats flatout robbery
overall the hilton while beautiful needs a reality check for 2009 youre overpriced to start with and then you overcharge for everything else in this economy you would do well to rethink your strategy 
i would not stay here on a personal visit  id move up michigan avenue to something else next year i may stay at the essex next door someone mentioned they were there for 90night and it was great that would be a 200 savings each night pretty substantial",3.0
nice but needs some sprucing up,"if youre staying at the waldorf the towers are definitely preferable to the waldorfastoria rooms we were upgraded from an executive suite to the most enormous suite no 32a ive ever occupied in the us  a vast living room and a dining room with seating for twelve both with fireplaces and an entry foyer larger than most nyc hotel rooms the bedroom though spacious was oddly cold in atmosphere almost like a hospital room no warmth or charm at all similarly the bathroom and adjacent dressing area were cramped and poorly laid out and therefore not particularly comfortable the showers in both the stall and tub were completely dysfunctional  they were actually handheld shower hoses hanging in holders literally seven feet high and pointing at the wall not at you no matter what you did some parts of the rooms needed new paint too overall there was a slightly tired fusty feel to everything 
two additional quibbles one the lounge on the 26th floor where the complimentary continental breakfast is served is far too small to accommodate the guests of the towers even though we arrived quite late there were several groups ahead of us waiting to be seated two all of the restaurants and bars in the waldorf were mysteriously closed at lunchtime on saturday and not opening until later in the afternoon so we had to go across lexington avenue to the much cooler w hotel to spend our money this surprised us because we had enjoyed a nice lunch and cocktails at peacock alley the waldorf lobby barrestaurant on friday go figure

a very nice stay at affinia,stayed for 5 nights with family and had a very nice stay at the affinia the room we had on the 35 floor was really great it had the most fantastic views  the room was very clean and the room was cleaned every day with fresh towels only gripe was that we did have to ask a couple of times for a couple of extra pillows and did eventually get only one the kitchen is great to be able to make tea and coffee but it has no kettle and you really need one i used a pot to boil water and almost burned my hand as the handle gets really hot the staff were very kind and friendly and the doormen very helpful overall a really great hotel to stay in especially for the location macys just down the street the subway is also just a block away with the subway q r or n taking you to times square restaurants all around the hotel with a great pizza shop just on the corner the barking dog restaurant was not great at all to be honest ordered a burger and when i got it  it was very rare and when it was sent back to be sorted it came back the same way staff not too friendly very pricey for what we got i love new york and will definetly stay at the affinia again without hesitation and will recommend it to all my friends,4.0

great place well located,"i stayed in this hotel for 04 nights in jun10 and it is as good it was last couple of years this hotel is ideally located above metro center train stop has lovely places to walk around with in a minute from bustling china town and has some lovely affordable restaurants in the neighbourbood few minutes of brisk walking will take one to white house and washington memorial
overall the stay is great and place is good one sore point may be very minor i noticed a lot of dust in the work chair positioned in the room but till i left was never cleaned this is no big deal but some one is slipping up and thought should highlight here",4.0
in the heart of the action,my only complaint about the experience was the checkinwe were promised connecting rooms and they attempted to separate us by 5 floors they corrected the problem immediately after i complained to the clerk the hotel is undergoing renovations the lounge area on the 8th floor restaurant area is being redone and should be finished soon the rooms we had on the 35th floor had a wonderful view new decor and very comfortable beds my kids complained that there were no cash mini bars but i was fine with that even though it is in the middle of times square the room was very quiet and was an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle we had to leave two days early because of hurricane irene but we will shall return,5.0
excellent choice for park  fly,we selected this hotel to park  fly out of the indianapolis airport the rate was very reasonable the room was clean and the front desk staff was friendly the park  fly service worked well including the shuttle service to and from the airport the breakfast was relatively limited however since our flight was at 7 am it was much more important that it began at 5 am so we were able to eat before heading to the airport i would definitely stay here again to park  fly,4.0
this place is a slice of heaven in a hectic city,if youre worried that nyc is overwhelming hectic and full of stressed out strangers youre partially right but dont worry about that as this hotel is the 100 antidote relaxing warm cozy and primed to make you feel at home,4.0
good location but noisy,we booked at the last minute and the rate here was really good 162 considering location etc the room was great comfortable bed  goodsize bathroombut the outer walls were thin and at night you could hear everyone walk by your room which wasnt conducive to a good nights sleep the staff is very friendly and helpful and there is access to a computer  free wifi,3.0
what a rip off,"we stayed at this hotel for a few days sight seeing after skiing at lake tahoe the location is very convenient and the rooms clean but much smaller than the room we had at harveys in tahoe the decor was rather strange but that does not make it a bad hotel
what does however is sheratons policy to charge extortionate rates to use its underground car parking facilities be warned these robbers charge 43 plus tax per day for the privilege of leaving your car at the hotel you are already paying for whilst it was obvious that parking in this area was a money making racket the sheraton was easily the most expensive we saw there were no concessionary rates for guests when we complained to staff they were dismissive and unhelpful i would not return to this hotel",2.0
my new home away from home,i have been traveling to new york city for business pretty regularly these past few years and i have tried the budget places and the break the budget places finally i have found a place that i want to return to as soon as i stepped in i fell in love with the layout and decor the people were incredible hector checked me in and made me feel welcome like i was arriving at a friends house the room was great it was the most comfortable bed i have ever had at a hotel most of the time i stay in my room when i get in i could not wait to get downstairs and relax at the bar i cant say enough about this place i wish there were one of these everywhere i travel,5.0
the great tower 23,"3 friends and i decided to take 3 weeks out and venture on a mini road trip around the west coast of the states we began in new york and flew over to la from there we drove to san diego where one of my friends had booked 2 rooms at tower 23 hotel 
from the moment we arrived we were all taken away by the epic view overlooking pacific beach the sun loungers and water fountains added to this exotic feel creating a sense of surrealism the rooms were incredibly spacious and immaculately presented upon arrival we were warmly greeted by a charming young lady on the reception desk who i remember by her name badge was called rochel she checked us in and even called us once we were in our rooms to make sure everything was ok 
the restaurant and bar offered an array of well cooked food at a pleasant price which suited us just fine 
overall the stay was by far the best we experienced in the usa its just a shame that the most exhilarating aspect of our time in san diego was our visit to sea world oh well theres always next time",5.0
stayed here with university of miami alumni group,this was a centrally located hotel 23 miles from soldier field and the shedd museum and just steps away from michigan avenue shopping we spent the weekend walking to a football game museum shopping and dinner we never needed a car or a cab,4.0
the most sound proof hotel ive ever stayed in,great hotel friendly staff great view couldnt believe how quiet my room was,4.0
more good points and bad points,we stayed at this property twice recently at either end of our holiday we specifically wanted a one bedroom suite as one of us gets up earlier than the other so we only looked at properties that had this i dont agree with other posters that the rooms here are large if you are expecting just a hotel room then yes you would find the rooms large but this property bills itself as a residence in fact the one bedroom suite was very cramped for two people and their luggage basically the one bedroom suite is the same as the studio with a wall down the middle the photos on the web site are very accurate  the layout looked cramped and it was other than being cramped our first stay was very good the main reason we chose this suite property over others was because of the hot breakfast included it was good but monotonous  exactly the same thing every day they could vary the hot items a bit we loved the free wireless in the rooms  i wish all hotels had that the happy hour during the week is great if you are a light eater you could easily make this your supper there was always a hot item and a green salad and help yourself to the beer and wine and the wine was actually pretty goodthe staff at the front desk and on the door are very cheery and helpful we did have trouble getting help from the cleaning staff  called the front desk 3 times to get extra hangers eventually talked to the cleaning staff but none spoke enough english to understand our request our second stay was a bit of a surprise this time our suite was on the back side of the hotel right at 10 pm some band started up some where that ratttled the windows we never did figure out where the racket was coming from the hotel is 2 blocks from the party district 6th street  i thought that would be far enough but obviously not this was on a friday night so this may only be a problem on weekends we insisted on being moved unfortunately the hotel did not have any one bedrooms left that were not on the back side of the hotel but they gave us two studios next door to each other which worked out well,4.0
a good option in sundance square,"this was my third time to stay at the worthington we were here for the cowtown marathon so obviously the hotel was booked full of runners the worthington is in a great location to everything in sundance square the rooms are nice fairly average size and clean the bathrooms are nice but small with very little vanity space check in was quick and valet parking was fairly easy but expensive at 23day we got a group rate for this stay if i had to pay the regular rate i would probably shop around there are 2 or 3 other great options in sundance square
my only big complaint was the hallway noise when trying to sleep",4.0
good location amenities reasonable price,have stayed here several times before and its gotten better rooms are updated if a little smallish but typical of manhattan with a giant flat screen hdtv comfortable bed clean bathroom excellent location in midtown good place for breakfast right next door staff is pleasant free wifi in lobby 14 in rooms the nickel and diming of which i detest no coffee maker in rooms but a minibar if you want to pay the prices otherwise not a bad choice and you do get a chocolate chip cookie upon checkin as is doubletrees promise,4.0
not flash but excellent value for money,"stayed for 2 nights in early november 2011 this place has no pretensions of being anything than a motelmotor inn free parking is a bonus and when i booked the room rates were very low sub100 although i noticed that prices did go up substantially at a later date
clean and roomy with fridge and microwave old style tv free quick wireless internet was also a bonus decor is not overly modern and the furnishings etc are not brand new or overly modern bathroom is ok and clean
in hindsight the location is not that ideal although it is only 5 blocks walk to the cable car terminus on california st and there are many buses on van ness avenue at night we walked down larkin st to find some asian reaturants and as per many comments on the forums the area is a bit seedy after dark but not threatening
i have nothing negative to say about nob hill motor inn but probably wouldnt stay there again as we did also stay a night at union square and that was a much better location for us the nob hill motor inn does everything it sets out to do  good value lodging with free parking
email and phone communications i had with the front desk re our reservation were always responded to promptly and efficiently although we didnt get the room requested but that was no big problem aircon was a fiddly to get a comfortable temperature  maybe the thermostat wasnt working properly",3.0
best location in town if you want to party on beale st,clean big rooms great price only a few steps from the center of beale st action also a very safe location which can be an issue in memphis,5.0
easy walk to local fun,the staff was so helpful and attentive the only real issue we have is that the mirror is placed too high up in the bathroom and there isnt much room for toiletries the room is very comfortable,3.0
charming boston hotel,"my husband baby daughter and i stayed in the eliot hotel for one night after a weeklong trip to cape cod we wanted to stay in boston saturday night to be close to the airport for our sunday morning flight we have stayed in several hotels in boston over the years and we were thrilled with this hotel we had a premier suite that was large and perfect for us the living room was a perfect place to put our daughter in her
pack n play and she slept late the next day because of the wonderful draperies blocking the light until you open themwe had a great view of commonwealth ave were able to close the french doors to our bedroom and watch a little tv without disturbing her the rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated our room was in hues of blue and chocolate brown the bathroom was restored but still had beautiful old white marble and a seperate area to put on your makeup with good lighting there is also a seperate wet bar area off of the living room that was a great space to keep our daughter supplies food and bottles the bed was very comfortable and my husband really enjoyed the wireless internet the eliot is also in a fabulous location and just a short walk to so many wonderful restaurants and shops we were sad that we were only staying one night but are delighted to have found a favorite hotel in boston",5.0
good value thats about it,it had a bed a bathroom television pool and hot tub on the property good enough not the nicest hotel by far but it was located a short drive to old town gas lamp fashion center and balboa park for the location the price was right the pool was nice and the restaurant on the premesis served a good breakfast i wasnt there for the luxury just to go for a swim at night and sleep the rooms definitely could use an update,3.0
talk about location,i stayed 2 nights to enjoy christmas in ny i never even needed a taxi cause the location is perfect hotel rooms are lovely  spotless cant wait until next time,5.0
very pleased,"we visited hotel at times square in november 2010 with our 13 year old daughter this was our 3rd or 4th stay  dating back to when it was the super 8 hotel relax hotel has been remodled since then and is actually very nice
location is good few blocks down from radio city and a few blocks over from madness of times square grand central is a 5 minute walk  over a couple streets and down a few blocks
we made reservations online through applecorehotelscom we were able to reserve a 2 room suite for less than what other similar hotels charged for 1 room upon check in we received a aaa discount of about 15 per night so it was worth inquiring also good thing is cancellation policy is hassle free up tp day before checkin we actually cancelled first reservation and made another when we saw price on web site had dropped close to time for trip
the room and bathroom were very very clean and seemed to have been recently redone furnishings were all clean and new
breakfast was basic but good we prefer to go grab a bagel out but what the hotel offers donuts bagels coffee cereal  is not bad at all and free
little bar on 2nd floor was a new addition it is tiny but i did have a couple drinks there one night before heading out to a restaurant has to be only 3 beer in nyc was clean and waitress was friendly fine place to grab a quick drink while waiting for others in your party to get ready to go out
on day of check out we stored bags in lobby while sight seeing until late afternoon was a nice service by hotel
only negatives are that 1 elevators do run slow but we just took stais a couple times small inconvenience and waiting on the elevators would not have been a big deal
2 catching a cab is a little difficult bc 46th street is not that busy with cabs on the hotels block and there is no cab stand in front of the hotel unless you are really good at hailing cabs plan to take the subway or to get the concierge to arrange for a car service  or simply walk like we did most of the time
read review below saying had bedbugs but we saw absolutely no trace and we were looking for them bed bug registry google it said hotel was not infested
bottom line this is actually a perfectly good bordering on kinda nice moderately priced hotel in a great location i felt very safe and my wife and daughter were quite pleased  and they can be much more picky than me you will be out and about all the time anyway so why blow the budget on a four or five star place i would give this a very solid 35 stars we will be back  soon i hope",4.0
great stay and pet friendly,stayed here during hurricane sandy since my apartment lost power all of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating room service took about an hour but all the meals i had here were great would definitely recommend for anyone looking to be in a convenient midtown location,5.0
convenient place to stay in detroit,"overall we had a good stay at the greektown casino hotel i was a little concerned about the checkin process and service due to other reviews id read but these were no problem the front desk made the process quick and easy and was kind enough to assign us to rooms on the 29th floor which offered spectacular views of detroit and the surrounding area the rooms themselves although not big were clean modern and nicelyappointed the rates in the minibar were a lot less than what ive seen at other hotels in the detroit area which was a nice surprise the bathroom design was a little inconvenient since there was no way to use the sink without lighting up the whole room and waking anyone who still might have been sleeping but this wasnt a problem 
there were a couple of issues with the hotel first the walls seem to be very thin we didnt hear anything from the street our outside but you could hear anything that happened in the hallway like it was right there in your room both rooms were awakened by noise in the hallway during our stay secondly there was a disturbance in the room next to us that required hotel security to be called three different times the good news was that they responded promptly each time and eventually removed the problem so that we could get back to sleep the staff was very courteous about the incident and offered us free breakfasts and a discount on one of our rooms as well finally the hotel sports bar turns into a nightclub on weekends we came back from our event wanting to have a couple of drinks and watch the ncaa basketball games and were met with deafening music and a line to get in however the front desk was very helpful in finding a place just down the street that was quieter and had the games on
the main attraction to the hotel and the reason i would stay there again was its location its right in the greektown neighborhood which offers many different dining and entertainment options its connected to the casino by a secure indoor walkway and is also adjacent to the people mover which is the best way ive found to get around downtown detroit its also very easy to get to off the highway which was nice both on the way in and the way out in all we enjoyed our stay and would most likely stay there again when we are in detroit",4.0
 50 th  birthday trip of a lifetime ,"hotel staff were very nice especially richard reeves hotel security who for my birthday had some fruit and cheescake sent to the room which was a lovely surprise after returning from the phantom of the opera
the overall experience was great apart from one instance in the bar on my birthday where we had a manhattan cocktail before our meal booked at brasserie before the show
 firstly the bar person ought to have been more attentive as when my husband paid the barman we left to go to our room a couple of minutes later a waitress came running after us to say we hadnt paid our bill which was very embarassing as we were talking to richard at the time about my cameraso was rather rude  but she apologised quietly it was rather unneccessary as if we hadnt have paid the bill they should have charged our room
secondly the pre theatre dinner is a bit of a con my husband quietly went off to book it as a surprise it had a notice outside which said three courses for 30 each when we sat down we were led to believe it was for anything on the menu before 7pm it didnt say it was a set menu on the notice outside the waiter came over and gave us this other menu which had gone up to 35 i did complain and he said this was a better choice there wasnt really a choice it was just a set meal in the end we did order the rib eye which was what we thought we were going to get anyway but worked out very expensive although it was lovely
the room itself was lovely and clean every day apart from one day we came in about teatime and the bed was half made as if she got interrupted and forgotten about it but she came back and apologised the bed was to die for was so so comfortable lovely to get into at night after an exhausting day sightseeing hard to get out of in the morning would reccommend going for the kingsize to anybody who is thinking of staying here fabulous baseapart from the couple of glitches i would reccommend this hotel to anyone and say a big hello to richard
thank you for a pleasant stay ",4.0
friendly and cheap,"pli was our base during our three weeks summer holiday stay in sd and surroundings very friendly helpful and serviceminded manager he did all the best for us always with an honest smile our group of 9 four adults three teenagers two under 10 shared two rooms not much space main bed very good the other one sofa bed a little soft for the kids sharing it  they ended up in a heap in the middle but no serious complaints from the tired ones bathroom and kitchen ok same with the cleaning
all in all we got what we payed for the only thing we really missed was a couple of extra chairs round the balcony table in the evenings when socialising keep up the good work
with kind regards

like visiting grandmothers cottage in sf,"we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and found it to be very charming a nice break from the bustling city of san fran walking into the hotel felt like stepping into a parlor at your grandmothers home they have warm apple cider and cookies at all times to greet you and our room was extremely spacious and delightful we had a separate bedroom kitchenette with fridge and complimentary soda  water a powder room and bathroom the fireplace was a nice touch 
the building itself is pretty old so be prepared for some imperfections although everything is very clean the elevator is little scary you have to manually open the door each time we got in we found ourselves praying we didnt get stuck the bathroom was also quite small and could use some renovating the breakfast each morning is complimentary and absolutely delicious everything from homemade quiche to eggs to blueberry scones you eat downstairs in a parlor overlooking the courtyard it takes you back to old england charm 
the location is on a busy street in between the actors theatre of sf and another hotel the petite auberge which has the same owners parking is much cheaper in comparison to other hotels nearby but it does take about 15 minutes each time for the valet to pull it up union square is within walking distance as is chinatown 
overall a charming and quaint hotel lots of great amenities and an excellent value",4.0
beautiful hotel haughty staff,"just checked out this morning the hotel is beautiful and in a great location if you are careful walking at night if you go one block in the wrong direction it gets pretty seedy and a bit scary we met two police officers at the end corner the hotel is on last night who were there to ensure tourists didnt go any further in that direction 
the room was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows that provided a spectacular view the towels were horrible for such an upscale hotel they were rough thin and frayed in spots not at all what i expected the room even on the 23rd floor wasa bit noisy from all the sirens throughout the night all in all the room was really good
the staff on the other hand were rude snobby and unhelpful the gentleman that checked us in early was rude and haughty the concierge that we asked for additional information on the barberry coast walking tour was unhelpful and the bartender that didnt know what blueberry tea was had no interest in googling it to find out or offering other alternatives and eventually just walked away from us 
like a previous post i certainly wouldnt pay these folks again for the privelage of being rude to me",3.0
we love this place,its the second time weve stayed here the location is perfect  near the subway and bus stop the staff is extremely helpful  especially the bellmen the afternoon happy hour of drinks and snacks was great folks gather here to socialize and we met some nice people from around the country during our stay the breakfast is nothing fancy but the food is fresh and good and nicely displayed on every floor the beds and pillows are very comfortable the place is spotless the furnishings are nice we would definitely recommend this place the view isnt great from some of the rooms if thats a big deal to you,5.0
hotel itself was nice service was not,booked room through hotwire then immediately called the hotel to request double beds with river facing view was assured that this was taken care of over the phone when checking in found out that there was no notation or record of my call was given partial view double beds so was fine with that and went up to room it was 4pm but room was not cleaned dirty towels everywhere tv on etc so called down and was given another room desk barely said sorry this time in new room there were used condoms lube etc found in drawer while i was looking for a pen did not call down because was tired when i discovered but we were very disgusted late at night housekeeping comes with pillows that were not requested but she insisted they were and disturbed our rest when checking out told all to desk but was given halfhearted apology very very disappointed with this hyatt regency it was certainly the low point of our visit to philly especially since we were with a guest from overseas,3.0
could never be worth the price,given the price the arctic doubletree does not live up to what should be available to a customer the rooms are average except for a noisy bar fridge and service was terrible valet parking is blocks away and took 45 minutes to get a car when i was the only customer getting a vehicle front desk was worthless in trying to help resolve problems so the hotel was simply not up to what i would expect from a quality hotel,1.0

highly recommended,"i booked this hotel through marriottcom after seeing the excellent reviews on trip advisor the reviews were spot on this hotel is exceptionally wellmanaged very clean and resides in a wonderful location less than three miles from the airport built in a new planned community called liberty station its surrounded by restaurants and shops is flanked by a lovely inland waterway and is very quiet except for the occasional jet flying over
the earlier reviewer said she thought the place was expensive but she must have bought last minute i reserved a room here less than three weeks before my stay at a aaa rate of 119night i consider this an exceptional value",5.0
not too happy,"the price was good the staff was friendly however i could not help but to feel cheated these suites are not what you get some where like the homewood suites where there are two separate rooms tv room and bed room these suites were one big room with bookshelves in between not good when you want to put two kids to sleep and enjoy some adult time
the pool was great during the day at night forget it its pitch dark i relayed my concerns to the front t desk who adviced me the lights were not working apparently due to some glitch in the remodeling process they are in middle of extensive renovation
one more thing the parking garage has a card reader which allows you to access the premises its in the back of the property through a narrow alley when my wife made the turn into the card reader she took the turn into the card reader my wifes fault totally but just something to watch out for she claims that card reader came out of nowhere and hit her",3.0
this hotel perfectly met out needs,what can i say perfection the wifey  i went to nyc for 5 days to sight see from 222227 we prefer hilton brands  chose this hotel based upon trip advisor recommendations  price the positive recommendations were spot on hotel was perfectly clean in a perfect location and priced perfectly we stayed in room 1002 it was on the corner perfect facing 8th ave it wasnt loud at all we will definitely return to this perfect hotel,5.0
great comfy stay,my boyfriend and i stayed for 3 nights we arrived after a long flight to be greeted by a really helpful cheery reception staff room was clean and bed was super comfy clean white bedding we were cold on the first night but had no problem following nights fridge provided luggage stands and tv with more the enough channels bit out of downtown area but we were given a map by staff and directions to bus and trolley which only costs 9 for a two day pass within walking distances of good seafood and restaurants had a brilliant stay and the muffins at breakfast were amazing would definately stay again,5.0
theres way better out there,i worked in hotels for 15 years from maintenance to management and all points in between so i really give hotels the benefit of the doubt this hotel unfortunately is terrible the first room they gave us was occupied there was a soap wrapper and a lot of hair behind bathroom door ac controls did not work properly high heat was actually ac carpet needs to be replaced cleaning wont help it nasty comforter the coffee maker had the guest before us coffee in it they said they would move us for the 2nd night they didnt the second night it was prostitute central blatant beyond obvious we put a chair up against our door and hardly slept the third night was a free night using our hotel points we left anyway knowing we would lose those points,1.0
convenient location but rowdy lobby atmosphere,i stayed with my husband and two children for a trip that combined leisure and business we arrived at 9pm to checkin and the lobby was full of guests socializing this hotel seems popular for childrens sports teams to stay and they were all up and having drinks and snacks at 9pm the rooms were clean and modern curiously the cabinet next to the tv was at an angle and looked like it was built that way the room included a refrigerator and coffee maker but the coffee pitcher was missing the floor we were on was relatively quiet unlike the lobby the cafe in the lobby was convenient to buy breakfast with good hot and continental selections and there was free coffee in the lobby each morning i took a cab to the convention center the ride cost 22 for a meeting the location was not too far from sea world less than 10 minutes which was the highlight of our trip although other customers complained about the 16 parking fee each day i could see why they charged it because it would discourage nonguest use of the space the hotel guests needed i worried we wouldnt get a space each night and sometimes got the very last space,3.0
what a fantastic little treasure,"we went on a long road trip from toronto to new orleans la for new years but made a few stops along the way we got into the habit of stopping at the visitors centers thoughout the states and they always seemed to have the best deals on hotels when we got to memphis we were recommended to stay at the comfort inn right downtown memphis and it was 85  tax which we thought was a great deal for the location and one of the cheapest places we stayed all trip they have a comlimentary breakfast rooms were better than expected  very clean and well appointed 
would stay here again and it was a short 1 tram ride to beale stthe greatest little blues spot weve ever been to",5.0
great bar great location thats where it ends,was terribly disappointed with the room set up imagine traveling for business and there is no desk in your room also the internet hookup required me to go to reception and request a special piece of equipment which i would be charged for 150 should i not personally return it,2.0

perfect low budget hotel  even though the shared bathroom,"i went to ny due to intervies for a job the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful where to go and what to recommend sure the room was perhaps not very fancy but it had everything i needed and the rooms towards the garden were quiet the ac was a bit loud though but after being awake for about 18h that did not bother my sleep 
even though the bathrooms are shared you could never see that anyone had been there prior to you unless they closed the door after taking a long shower 
the location was perfect subway station max 10 min away internet cafe 3 blocks away many beauty salons and restaurants close by i love to walk so therefore i walked through half of ny and noticed that the location of the hotel was much closer to everything than i thought 
definitly a pleasant experience and i would definitly visit hotel 17 in the future ",4.0
do not stay here,room was tiny and with only 4 rooms to each floor very noisy from other guests using elevators and banging doors on the first night i noticed a bug crawling on the bed after having the window open for a small time i thought it may have just been something that had crawled in two days later i came out in this terrible rash on my shoulders which then turned into painful and itchy welts extending to my arms hand legs and face including eyelids the following day the same day my friend came out in the same thing we could not work out what it was at first so on returning home from the trip i went to the doctor and did some of my own research the welts are the result of being bitten by bed bugs disgusting all i can say is do not stay here,1.0
amazingly comfortable bed,spacious and quiet i was in sf for business and was relieved to have such a pleasant place to rest my head i had a room facing bush st and never heard any noise for the 6 nites i was there the mattress is amazingly comfortable the fact that this is a ecofriendly hotel makes high marks too the location is great for exploring chinatown the staff is very friendly and accomodating the only suggestion i would have for them is to offer more tv channels,4.0

high price old dingy hotel,great hotel if you need to check in with your probation officer because their office is only a half a block from the hotel and you can see all the other offenders lined up to get in it is a short walk to the theaters and time square inside the hotel the rooms are old with cheap furnishings and a dark dirty looking carpet there was mildew around the tub for the most part the staff was very friendly with the expection of when we checked in the lobby is very small and we were ordered to sit down and not stand in front of the desk clerk they dont have much of a restaurant so dont waste your time there we went across the street there is a side door at the port authority with a food court we didnt stay in our room long and enjoyed going to the theater to phantom and spiderman if you go to see spiderman get the box seats so you can enjoy all the aerial stunts to get discount tickets at tkts avoid the long lines and take the subway to the south side or brooklyn locations it is worth the discount in chinatown go to pings for dim sum at 1130 am where it is fresh and not so crowded at that time,2.0
it was a great stay,had to go to houston for a funeral which is never pleasant the hotels staff was wonderful and made us feel very welcomed and comfortable spent 3 days and would reccomend this property to anyone room and entire hotel was very clean my daughter last her stuffed animal and we thought it was gone when we asked the desk clerk to keep an eye out for it when we walked into the room later that evening it was sitting on the bed with a note from the clerk that it was found in the parking lot a step above  beyond when double checked that it had found its way home very nice stay,5.0

great service,"we competed in the seattle firefighter stairclimb this past weekend and stayed at the pan pacific the hotel was beautiful but more importantly was in a convenient location to our competition and mike one of the valets was beyond exceptional with his service he went above and beyond on more than one occasion helping us with our gear back and forth to our vehicles this made our whole experience that much better and easier 
room was nice and spacious with a great layout 
we would definitely go back ",5.0
merely a club which happens to have hotel rooms above it nothing more,stayed for a weekend which was supposed to be a romantic stay in the heart of times square other than the location being convenient i dont have any other good things to say of this hotel management here seems to be more focused on running a club rather than a hotel while staying less than two days i encountered three incidents which left me very dissatisfied first when we were in need of a towel we called the lobby requesting some a card states to leave your old towels by the door to receive new ones within minutes the old towels were gone but never received any new ones after some time we called again asking for the towels which we were told theyre on the way after about 45 minutes we ran out of patience and were forced to dry ourselves with a hand towel finally after coming home hours later we see that our room was cleaned and towels replaced then we requested for a dress to be dry cleaned we were told we couldnt leave it with the concierge and had to return to our room to fill out a form instead we were already running late and they still wouldnt hold the dress for us in addition there was never any form at our room to begin with we skipped that process and proceeded with our night finally after returning later that evening we asked for a form to request the dry cleaning service again we did not ask for overnight service and were told the regular time would have the dress back by 7pm which was fine the fee as stated on the form was to be 23 we had the dress returned to us at about noon and were actually impressed with the service so we thought upon checkout we were in need of catching a train and needed to check out quickly we were told we had to wait because the computers were down after making us late and causing us to wait longer they finally had the nerve to charge us 45 or the dry cleaning since i didnt have time to waste i showed how disgusted i was with the charge yet paid just to be on my way which then came to 49 after tax so altogether 50 to simply dry clean a dress i was referred to this hotel because of its uniqueness and location though i wouldnt return here in the future nor would i suggest anyone else who is looking for decent service in return for the 250 nightly rate,2.0
great hotel great location,"this was the second time i stayed at the hotel belleclaire and it was another great experience they have redone all the rooms with modern decor our room had a king size on the first floor which was nice because we didnt have to wait for the elevator since one of them was out bed was comfortable rooms also had nice flat screen tvs and a minirefrigerator nice bathrooms clean bath tub was a bit narrow but nothing major front desk staff was courteous and knowledgeable the weather was warm when we were there for that time of year so the room got pretty hot but we just cracked a window and all was fine
only two blocks from the subway and close to shoppingfoodbarsgrocery etc subway makes it easy to get anywhere in the city from this upper west side location also just a few blocks from central park free wireless internet was nice perk as well great value hotel for the location",4.0
nice hoteluntil we found bed bugs,we were staying at the candlewood suites for a convention this weekend when we arrived we found the room to be nice and clean like most hotels we stay at we check the beds and surrounding areas and found nothing when i went to bed i just happened to wake up and found an apple seed sized bug on my pillow this was one of many that were found in my bed as well as the other bed we notified the desk and decided to check out im sure this is was an isolated incident but just wanted to let future travelers know,3.0
great location not great hotel,"my husband and i stayed in the chancellor hotel for the second part of our honeymoon first impressions werent great we were barely able to stand in the queue to check in as we apparently arrived on a polling day and there were booths all over the small lobby when i checked in the receptionist really wasnt very friendly at all and seemed to get quite agitated with me as part of our package we were given cable car tickets but when i actually asked the receptionist for these she seemed angry at the request 
we had a lovely welcome in the room of a bottle of wine and chocolates as we were a honeymoon couple but unfortunately we didnt get the best view that we were asking for
the shower in the bathroom was really disappointing and was barely strong enough to wash my hair after the first night the main light in the room also stopped working but didnt want to report this to the reception as they had treated us quite badly the first night
the location was on union square and it was definitely a brilliant spot all in all the hotel was adequate but nothing to shout about",4.0
great stay,i traveled with my teenage son rooms were clean staff were friendly and helpful good breakfast enjoyed the dvd player in room with list of movies to enjoy after a long day of sight seeing i felt safe here hidden gem great price,5.0
severely disappointed not 4star quality,"i just checked out of pointe tapatio cliffs about an hour ago i live in the south valley and had to spend the day in the north valley so my husband and i thought it would be nice to get dinner and stay overnight we went to a different pointe of view and i have to say it was exceptional i wrote a separate review for the restaurant overall dinner was excellent and i would definitely go back 
i cannot say the same for the hotel before describing the problems i encountered i will state that almost every employee was very nice helpful smiling and generally welcoming i have nothing but the highest praise for the shuttle drivers who were prompt entertaining and super nice both times we called them the furnishings and decor in the room were comfortable and clean but i would say the room itself was a 3 star at most for a 4 star price of course 
i checked in at about 3pm and quickly left to attend a function we returned to the room after dinner at about midnight it was extremely hot in the room i live in arizona so i do not use the term extremely hot lightly it had to have been almost 100 degrees i couldnt say for sure however because the air conditioner unit was showing 75 which is how i presume it was last set i cranked it down to 68 then we collapsed into bed at 2am i awoke drenched in sweat i got up to check the air conditioner and it still said 68 but it was definitely not 68 in the room i set it to fanhigh instead of auto and tried to go back to sleep after tossing and turning awake for about another half an hour i got up again and checked the vent i found the air was blowing  hot there was hot air hot air blowing out of the vents when i set it to 68 there was no hotcold function just a temperature setting i was so unbelievably tired i just turned the unit off and decided to open the window unfortunately the windows at the front of the room dont open at all the only window to open was to the balcony since no other windows would open it took a while to get cool air into the room finally around 315 i was able to get back to sleep without any sheets or blankets i might add luckily we were right near the entrance to the resort so every few minutes cars would drive by or drunken guests would stumble about or in general some very loud outside noise would rouse me there was a brief respite between about 430 and 630 in which i almost got good sleep almost then the groundskeepers started their work and i gave up even trying i left the bedroom and went to make myself a cup of coffee i added the creamers they provided and wouldnt you know it they were spoiled a hundred little chunks of what should have been liquid creamer floated to the top of my coffee thanks hilton no longer trusting anything in the room i had to drive myself to the starbucks on the corner 
in discussing this with my husband i decided i wanted to check out personally so i could let the front desk know about the ac and hopefully get some sort of remediation or at the very least an apology no such luck the petite blonde at the counter had a smile pasted to her face the whole time but never once said the word sorry or apologize what she did say was that maintenance is available 24 hours i attempted to explain to her that at 3am when i am dead tired i did not want to wait up for the maintenance man and then endure his repairs and lose the entire night of sleep nor did i want to have to get up pack all of my things again and move she gave me the look and repeated maintenance is available 24 hours i pointed out to her that unless they havent rented that room in the past month they had to have been aware of the air conditioner issue so why would they stick us in there she repeated that maintenance is available 24 hours she was not only frustrating she was condescending and rude and if i had the time i would have waited to speak to the manager since i didnt ive decided to write this review maybe they will see it and try to correct their issues i realize that had we been given any other room i probably would have been very satisfied with my stay there the way i see it however is that they take lackadaisical care of their property renting rooms to people when they clearly must have known they were subpar and then showed no interest in customer service or ensuring repeat business when the problems were brought to their attention to imply my sleepless night was my own fault becuase i was too tired to spend the night with their maintenance team is beyond the pale i will never stay at another hilton i will stick to marriott from now on i will also ensure i detail this encounter to everyone one i know just awful",2.0
wonderful as usual,weve been staying at this hotel for many years  it was the plaza 50 when we began to visit weve always been very well treated by the staff most of the rooms are terrific and all are much more spacious than the average nyc hotel room we love the location  lots of good restaurants  bars walking distance to great shopping and not all that far from the theater district this is not the place for a first time visitor to nyc who wants to be in the middle of the action and sight seeing tours it is ideal for families and for people who want to feel as though they actually live in new york,5.0
perfect place for me to stay,"i stayed in a cabin room on the 6th floor at the jane for 8 nights in august 2011 i was traveling alone to nyc for the very first time and had a wonderful stay at the jane it was the perfect place for me as a solo traveler because it was inexpensive compared to other options but you get great value for your money yes the rooms arent much more than a bed and a bit of space to put your stuff but if you are in new york city why would you want to spend time in your hotel room other than to sleep the staff at the jane were all very polite and happy to do what they could to make your stay wonderful
the bathrooms are shared but they are frequently cleaned and i never had a problem with their cleanliness or having to wait to use one brushing your teeth in the morning dont forget to look out of the window for a distant view of the statue of liberty
the hotel includes free wifi which i took advantage of the connection seemed to be very stable and the speed was great compared to other hotels i have stayed at
i also really liked the location of the jane in west village it is right at the end of jane street very close to the hudson river and the hudson river bike path which follows the west shore
while i was staying at the hotel i recorded a video tour and review of the hotel which you can watch on youtube for more details httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvirtfgr0nfsm",5.0
stay away from this place,"when i went to make my reservation which i did two weeks ahead i went on line to la quintas website i was directed to some other portal i have to pay ahead and the cost was nonrefundable when we arrived they did not have the room we requested so we were going to go elsewhere but the general manager said we would have to get our money back from the middleman website i tried to call that website and to this day have never gotten a call back and no one ever answers the telephone
so we ended up taking a smaller room hotel is on the freeway very noisy i guess if you are luck you can get a room on the inside court yard and only have to listen to the pool noise the room was clean but the rest of the hotel was dirty
they will also fee you to death they charge you 10 per night for parking in their own parking lot and they will charge you a fee to use the inroom safe even if you dont use it i left my family heirlooms at home so i didnt need the safe but that did not matter
there are so many other nice places to stay in the area best western holiday inn express and marriott courtyardthat it is worth the further investigation",1.0
perfectly nice and reasonably priced,we stayed for one night for the bulls vs pacers playoffs i was a little nervous after reading the reviews but the hotel was perfectly fine the bed was comfortable the bathroom was nice and there was an extra sink and vanity in the bedroom which allowed my husband and i to both be getting ready at the same time i love having the extra sitting room with another tv i had read complaints about the rooms being too hot at night but ours was quite comfortable and there was an overhead fan i had also read complaints about noise but we were on the 7th floor and we didnt hear a thing from outside or from the inside of the hotel the managers reception and breakfast are always a pleasant touch theres a really nice fitness center thats open 24 hours the location is great in the middle of downtown with lots of shopping and eating options steps away and easy walking distance to conseco field only a few small negatives  the rooms show a little bit of wear and tear in areas the indoor pool area wasnt great the pedestrian entrance is kind of strange and theres a 20 parking fee which actually isnt that bad for the area but for 120night on the weekend we were really pleased with our stay,4.0
free coffee dodgy location,"although only a few blocks from union square we were dismayed to find that we felt very unsafe around our hotel after 7pm at night meaning that if we wanted to venture out we had to get a taxi
the room was ok but avoid getting put at the back of the building on the first floor ie room 105 as it is right on a back street where people tend to have disagreements in the middle of the night and you are woken up like clockwork at 5am by some loud van
apart from that the staff were friendly enough coming to fix our smoke alarm as it beeped through the night and calming us down at the false fire alarm that confused us greatly one dark night as we were fast asleep",2.0
novotel broadway a winner,had a wonderful stay at the novotel on broadway prime location for easy access to just about anywhere our room was extremely clean and comfortable lovely spotless bathroom we were also surprised at how quiet it was at night we overlooked times square but were not disturbed by the noise at alland it is noisy and busy and wonderful we would return to this hotel with no hesitation we had a fabulous holiday,4.0
newly renovated hotel,"i stayed 2 nights in this hotel the hotel is newly renovated nice furniture bathroom and bed the free breakfast is not the best but above average free wirless internet with good signalt he location is convenience to everything grocery stores and lot of restaurants are near by
the only problem is the refrigerator in my room there is ticking sound all nights which is not fthe normal sound from the compressor it is very annoying and made us cant sleep all night i complianted to the night clerk and was told the maintenance guy would fix it but it is still the same in next night finally i needed to unplug it i told the manager when i checked out she said that t she knew it and the refrigerator has to be replacded what a customer service why they dont fix the problem before check in guest
overall i statisfy the hotel and would recommend to others but dont forget to check the refrigerator",4.0
great location  close to everything,for those looking for good value clean rooms and central location this is a great choice we explored the entire city of boston and only needed to hop on a train twice in four days t line a few short blocks away very walkable city and we felt safe even at night whole foods and cvs next door very convenient skip the chain restaurants there arent many and head to the authentic familyowned ones this hotel is a great choice for those families who want to use it as a base and spend most of their time exploring the city staff very friendly and attentive,4.0
great mix of corporate and boutique,"its in a great location in downtown san francisco  about two blocks from the ferry terminal building and about three blocks from the transamerica building
the person who checked us in was very friendly and although we were on the lowest hotel floor 7 we had great views of the bay bridge from a small balcony we had a small office area with a desk and two chairs which was great for setting up a laptop unfortunately the wireless access isnt free
the decor is modern  more boutique hotel than corporate 
the bed was really nice and comfortable the bathroom was large and the products were nice theres a large gym in the basement of the hotel 
i would definitely stay here again",4.0
not the best but not the worst,"i booked a nonsmoking room but was placed in a smoking room two nights in a row they were full and could not move me the room smelled like stale smoke it hits you as you get off of the elevator keep in mind the 5th and 6th floors also allow pets 
i read the upper suites have been remodeled my floor 5 was not the carpet in the suite and on the balcony was stained
there are good things about the hotel the bed was comfortable the views were amazing and you have a private balcony breafast was good and parking is free",3.0
had a very nice stay here,i stayed for a long labor day weekend the hotel was very nice if a bit far from the freedom trail room cleanliness and amenities were on par with the sheraton brand staff was friendly and helpful my room had a nice view of the river the best feature is that it is attached to the copley shopping mall and the area is very trendy with lots of great places to eat and shop i also got a great deal using pricelines name your own price or less than 80night,5.0
excellent stay  we couldnt believe what good value it was,stayed here at the start and end of our trip to the states using satnav it was very easy to find and a convenient drive to and from the airport we liked this hotel very much it was incredibly good value the staff were all very pleasant and welcoming and the accomodation very good there are free snacks and drinks between 530 and 7pm every evening and also breakfast is included in the price although this was not the best breakfast that we had during our trip it was adequate and we felt that it was excellent for the price that we had paid it is also adjacent to a mall  i could walk across to macys while my husband sat at the pool it is a lovely mall with lots of shops eating places and cinemas so we were very happy with its location the hotel also had free wireless internet and parking if i flew into charlotte again i would not consider staying anywhere else,5.0
home away from home,despite 3 years since my last trip to san francisco the staff at the inn at union square treated me like a vip a perfect location for theatre shopping museums and nightclubs the desk staff provided great suggestions for restaurants and mass transit is available right outside the door the inn is my first choice when visiting san francisco,5.0
good choice if you have a conference,if you have a conference at the mccormick center this hotel is a good choice if not this hotel is out of the way and the facilities are underwhelming the rooms are adequate  there was a nice city view from the thirtyfirst floor  and the checkin  reception staff was very friendly the rooms are a bit drab if youre not in town for a conference think about a different hyatt property,3.0
dont stay if you plan on moving around in your own room,my husband and i and our 10 month old took a quick trip to chicago we stayed one night at the palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel i guess i am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small i couldnt set up a pack and play for my son i had to call and upgrade my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep the lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a holiday inn the wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty i will never stay there again,2.0
good value for nyc,"great location if you want to see greenwhich village you can walk to soho east  west village union sq and easy access by subway to all other parts of city 4th street train station is right down the street
mario batalis babbo is across the street and some great little places to eat on cornelia st about 2 blocks away i especially liked the cuban place i think its called havana it on cornelia 
the staff here can be aloof at best and very rude at worst i stay here a lot as i do work at nyu definitely worth splurging for a deluxe room as the regular rooms are very small
if you are a toursit i recommend the west village walking tour offered by big onion they have a website with a schedule of their walking tours 
the barlounge in the basement behind c3 is hidden but worth finding",4.0

daughters birthday brunch,we enjoyed an amazing brunch on sunday morning excellent food with a wide variety of choices the wait staff kept the champagneorange juicewater glasses full as well as kept the dirty plates cleared as soon as they were emptied it was a relaxing meal in a lovely setting with windows opening on to the gardens the dining room had a elegant open airy feel to it but also was appropriately equipped to minimize noise we had a table of 12 and could actually hear each other talk we were not rushed through the meal actually spending the good part of 25 hours a very enjoyable family event,5.0

this has been our 4th visit of over 7 days and will be returning for 10 days next year",5.0
great location small rooms,"i had a regular king room on the top floor my general experience was great the room was clean the staff were friendly and i really liked the spacious bathroom 
however it did bother me that the room was very small it was probably the size of two king beds put togheter i felt like the bathroom was almost as big as the bed room also it bothered me that the tv is not flat screen i guess that is just pure ocd which made the hotel appear older than it actually is but in general it was very clean and a pleasant stay the windows of the room were very big but the view was the marriott across the street not particularly exciting
for its cleanliness service and very satisfying interior decor it definitely deserve a 4 star

great location not great for biz travelers,"ill start with the good
le parker meridien is in a fantastic location right near central park and all the wonderful shopping a person could ask for i have a yearly business trip and we book a small block of rooms here every year the place is very chic valet is easy and the secret burger joint is cool if you are a business traveler however i prefer to stay in a hotel which caters to this there is no wireless internet and to get the chord you have to get one from the desk or call to have one brought up they are not just in the rooms i think this is a big inconvenience and i am typically not picky at all the beds are great and there are plasma tvs the elevators are awful staying on the 20th floor like i did this past staywell budget 1015 minutes to get to the lobby they lobby is so busy which has the great hustle and bustle of nyc but there are better lounge type lobbies in town the restuarant is cute an old charming french place but somewhat forgetable 
i love this place for its location and the chicness but as a business traveler who makes 35 other trips to nyc per year there are many more i prefer",3.0
great vacation location,"i decided to book the dana even after reading a bunch of scary reviews  and i am glad that i did the location was great the service was wonderful and we had a terrific time 
when we first arrived i did notice a sort of musty smell in the room but we left the windows open and ran the fan and it cleared right out 
the first night we walked around the marina then then took the bus into pacific beach  the concierge was very helpful during our stay and provided us with a lot of information the hardest part about taking the bus is waiting for it to arrive  patience isnt always easy it did take us longer to get from place to place but we saved a lot of money by not renting a car 
we had dinner at the more casual onsite resturant there is another more upscale resturant as well one night and ordered room service for breakfast one morning  both times the food was delicious and the portions were large i enjoyed my surfer burritto for two days because it was so big 
both pools were great they were clean there were plenty of towels and they werent crowded while we were there the temperature was pretty cool but we enjoyed swimming anyways 
the main reason i selected this hotel was the close proximity to sea world it really paid off we took the first shuttle of the day and arrived 10 minutes before the park opened at the end of the night we walked back to the hotel it was well after the last shuttle ran  even though wed been at the park for 9 hours the walk was doable and safe 
i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone  especially to people who dont want to spend a ton of money but still would like a location with good atmosphere",4.0
no complaints and im picky,"i stayed there during a soldout conference and was completely pleased great beds fabulous location great housekeeping wonderful room service amazingly quiet for being so downtown they were also quite kind and accomodating to a colleague who became ill while there very much went the extra mile for him and again those heavenly beds were handy i also had one of the best hot stone massages ive ever had as a patron in their spa
only tiny complaints were that the pool is much too small for a hotel of this caliber and there are places when one can see the hotels age a little extra caulking in the bathtubs may be called for fairly soon 
but these are minor quibbles not dealbreakers overall a heavenly refuge for the traveler i would certainly go again although after reading other reviews i will be sure to check priceline next time",4.0
great resort location needing a little tlc,"with all the resorts in the phoenixscottsdale area the arizona biltmore is unique having been built in 1929 well before most of the other resorts in the area the frank lloyd wright inspired architecture is worth a visit on its own and the grounds are well maintained and pleasant to the eye the conference facilities are on a par with most other resorts and their fine dining restaurant wrights at the biltmore is excellent the accomodations however are due a makeover the furniture in our room was outdated and worn the carpeting has reached its limit
and the general feel of the room does not match that of the public areas this was our second visit for a conference and the comments regarding our room applied to both visits our rating of average was in comparison with other resorttype hotels",3.0
good value for money,"this was our first visit to nyc and the salisbury was a great base literally on the doorstep of central park the hotel itself is a little dated in places but we did not expect anything too luxurious as we were not paying top dollar we were able to explore one of the worlds great cities on foot because the hotel is so well situated our room was clean and spacious and had everything we needed for our week long stay including a safety deposit box
i would and hope to return to this hotel one day soon to explore new york some more",3.0
nice hotel great roof view of statue,"we stayed two nights at the conrad and was generally pleased with the hotel nice rooms that were spacious and newly renovated if you needwant to be in the wtc area this is a good one a bit tedious to get anywhere else though 
the only complaints we had were
 housekeeping disregarded the privacy light twice once to ask when they come inhint if the light is onyou are not welcome to open the door to ask
 sheets were dirty makeup smear and had to get replacements
we did appreciate the nespresso as we have one at home and had none during out two week vacation overseas also has a great view of the statue of liberty from the roof top bar",4.0
friendly staff bathroom wasnt clean on arrival elevator  hallway floors filthy,the staff was very nice and helpful however upon arrival there was hair all over the lid and seat of the toilet they offered another room which i turned down at first but after a 30 minute wait for housekeeping i decided to take the other room they kindly upgraded me to a suite which was nice i was also surprised at how poorly maintained the elevator floors and some of the hallway floors were at first glance this is a pretty hotel but look a little further and its not living up to its potential,3.0
dont bother,the lobby is grand but the rooms and hallways are terrible bathrooms are so small you have to step out of hem to lather up paint peeling stains all over carpets in hallways very disappointing dont let the pictures on their website fool you i felt dirty after leaving there,1.0
charming comfortable great location,"we arrived here after being ripped off by a nonyellow cab please dont learn the hard way like ustake a yellow cab and were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel there was some building work going on in the square but it was still a lovely open location which made it really peaceful its extremely close to the greenwich soho cool shops and really close for bleaker street everything else is within walking distance or easy to get to from the nearest subway station 
we had booked for a deluxe double which on the webiste was a little more expensive but said it would have either a city or park view the first room they gave us had a tiny window and a view of a drain and brick wallalthough this is quite common in new york we had specifically chosen this hotel and paid a bit extra because of the chance of a view the reception were very accomodating and found another room which was absolutely perfect large for new york standards and had two lovely big windows were we could see the park and the city a little bit the breakfast is great you can either have table service in the restaurant where you get a large choice of things brought to you or if you want you can have it in the lounge where you can help yourself and sometimes there is a bit more variety
all the staff were very friendly and very helpful the interiors are really quite lovely everything is clean and well kept greenwich itself is a great place to be based as its low rise so its bit calmer than uptown and times square
some cool restaurants to try are
johns pizzeria branch in soho and times square this is a converted chapel  massive yummy pizza very good value for money
fannellis cafe in soho  great food bit like cheers on the decor
joes shanghai  long wait so get there early also its quite crazy and you will be sat at a table with strangers but the dumplings are amazing  their speciality and so are their other dishes  try the greensmassive portions and cheap
del friscos  up market steak house next to the rockafella centre quite pricey but the most amazing steak and sides and a wine list of over 2000 wines
the mercer hotel kitchen  very cool interiors yummy food quite pricey but yummy cocktails

good central location,stayed here for 6 nights covering thanksgiving 2012 group of 3 very good location and easy walking distance for central park times square broadway madison avenue etc the hotels picture gallery on their website does not quite show what you get the apartment we stayed in was spacious and clean but was in need of redecoration i slept on the sofa bed in lounge area which was uncomfortable but my guests were comfortable in their bed although the hotel knew we were a party of three not enough towels were made available to us however the staff acted promptly when asked for more towels and in fact their maintenance team were prompt and efficient in dealing with a blocked toilet the kitchen equipment was useful but for european visitors a kettle would be welcome as we only used a small amount of crockery and cutlery daily we really would have preferred to use the kitchen sink to wash up rather than the dishwasher every day a washing cloth liquid and tea towel would therefore be welcome the hotels restaurant was not open when we were there and i was told by staff that it had been closed for a month due to refurbishment i saw no work going on also the hotel provided us with complimentary breakfast vouchers to use at a nearby deli but the one morning we decided to use it it was closed one elevator broken down often the hotel would also benefit from having instructions on how the equipment worked in each of the apartments instead of leaving it to trial and error on our day of departure i had booked a late check out time of 5pm when we returned to the hotel at 430pm we were locked out of the apartment i had to return to the reception desk to get this resolved which was done promptly but it is a long trek especially when you have two aged elevators i would go back to this hotel because although it had some little things it could improve upon overall it was a satisfactory apartment however these little improvements could make it into a great place to stay,3.0

great place to stay ,"we booked the legacy through preferred access and really enjoyed our one week stay at first we had a studio but upgraded to a 1 bedroom after walking through the models of each it would be easy to stay in a studio here but the 1 bedroom feels more like your own home lots of parking the on site restaurant is small but the food is great staff if friendly too washer  dryer in each room even the studios and the full kitchen is nice and has everything you need go buy some groceries and move right in there is a frys market about 1 12 miles away
only downsize to this resort is no free internet in the rooms you have to pay 995 per day to get online
pretty much in the middle of the phoenix area with easy freeway access quiet and clean rooms
we will definitely be back to the legacy",5.0
a sleek and elegant hotel with amazing service beds and views,i stayed overnight here on my way back home i had booked this hotel from a travel zoo special and i had mistakenly booked the wrong month the manager kindly refunded my  and although i couldnt get the same rate i was very grateful they accommodated me and refunded my mistake the beds are heavenly the room was luxurious and the room service was impeccable this is a great hotel for business people as it is in the financial district,5.0
comfortable but a little tired,"the westin name doubtless attracts many guests my booking was via a booking system and the price was good but i had no control over which chain i would get there is a lot of competition around lax and so standards should be high
westin has a shuttle bus which goes to two hotels and i had approximately a 10 minute wait  the driver checked how long another guest and i had waited making the point that a bus would be there in no more than 15 minutes  reasonable
i had no problems checking in midevening friday and on making my way to the room had the immediate impression in the corridors of a hotel ready for refurbishment  nothing specific just an atmosphere and old carpeting
in fact the room allocated 419 was large with a large bathroom and good facilities
the bed was large and comfortable
the inbath shower came with a flexible hose but also a selectable large rain head probably the best i have experienced in any hotel lately towels were large and good quality
it was difficult to find a convenient electrical socket but there were two wander leads with tv lamps etc plugged into them this ought to be a complete nono  i have no evidence of danger but do wonder whether this has been approved by the fire marshall
proper modernization would have separate sockets at mid height on a deskstyle surface adequate for working other hotel chains manage this better  go across the street to the hilton to see better design
the bar was pleasant well staffed and the food and drink good if expensive but no more so than other 4 star hotels
check out was simple efficient and quick",3.0
you get what you pay for,"this certainly wasnt a classy hotel but then we only paid a small price especially when compared to other hotels in new york 
as some people have mentioned there was no elevator service and it was quite an effort to get upstairs with our bags though a porter did help us get down stairs when we left 
the room and the bed were very small we stayed in a double but we werent there to spend time in the hotel so it wasnt a huge issue 
it was snowing outside and the heating in the room was always on very very high so much so that we were in t shirts in the hotel then layering up when we went outside
one thing that we found a little odd was that we had to give our key to the front desk each time we left the hotel and when returning we would tell the staff our room number and the key would be handed over without any checking of whether it was in fact our room not sure whether this is a great system 
overall it wasnt a bad stay but next time id probably try somewhere else",3.0
if i only had more time ,one night was not enough what a gem this hotel is wonderful accommodating staff a beautiful room nice bath products and a super comfy bed i dont want to leave and i hope i have a reason to return real soon btw the jogging path information provided in the room was a great idea and we used it,5.0
do not stay at this hotel,"i had read the reviews on this site and while they made me a little nervous i thought its a ramadait cant be that bad
it can and is that bad this place is absolutely disgusting the first clue is the dirty dark stairway up to the rooms no elevator all the rooms are enclosed under one roof no outside access i guess that can be good and bad but in this case its bad the smell in the corridor is bad enough but the smell upon entering the room is enough to knock you off your feet the room didnt appear to have been vaccumed in a while the furniture is stained 
while the bathroom appeared to be relatively clean the toilet didnt work we called the front desk about it and their answer was to knock on our door hand my husband a plunger and walk away ummmmexcuse me that did not solve the problem and with the second phone call the front desk manager entered the room and tried to instruct my husband on how to use a plunger ummmmagainexcuse me
we explained that we had a dinner to get to and needed the toilet fixed the employee could not say whether or not it would be and said there were no other rooms to move us to 
id had enough
right across the street is the coventry motor innsame price 200 better accommodations and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful they did not seem at all surprised when we told them our story and were able to get us a room for two nights needless to say we immediately went back across the street and checked out of the ramada limited
do not waste your time or money at the ramada limited",1.0
you get what you paid for,i dont see why people would rate this property very negatively the price for their room was 50 bucks what do you want in 50 a diamond shredded mattress frankly i was not upset with the stay yes room did need a bit of cleaning and the hotel staff needs to use more air freshner to at least keep the cigarette smell down if not eliminate if i had showed up with my family i would probably not stay here but for one night visit it was okay,3.0
great location,"the highlight of this hotel is its very good location tons to do within walking distance and very close to the market st subway for bart and muni and close to the cable car for fishermans wharf
the rooms may be a bit smaller but otherwise are fairly standard marriott rooms id say that if you get a good deal here go for it when its booked up and quite pricey you might not bother",4.0
holiday inn decor still haunts gild hall,"the only downside of gild hall is that the rooms still feel too close to a holiday inn the decor has been switched out and the red accents are modern but the layout is still basically the same this is not exactly what i expected from a thompson hotel 
the staff is stylish and attentive the bar is inviting the valet parking is convenient",3.0
great location  no frills but good price,i got a great deal through priceline so for well under a hundo doll ers this was a great deal really cant beat the location no frills but rooms were clean and my stay was great parking will run you ten a night,4.0
better than previous reviews suggest,i must admit i was a little nervous after reading some previous reviews some friends had made the reservation for them and us i was very pleased w the results as other posts had mentioned the staff was very friendly and accomodating it was in a great location to all of the neighborhoods we wanted to cruise the price was far better than others in the same area yes the fixtures carpet and wallpaper was somewhat dated and yes you had to climb a small flight of stairs to access the elevators none of those things matter to me the roombathroom was good sized and clean the breakfast buffet option was very plentiful and good i would return,4.0
could be fine but wasnt during my visit,i took a week to give thought to my review here  the hotel is obviously in the middle of an upgrade and that didnt bother me whatsoever im a penny pincher and i so wanted to give this hotel my vote of confindence but ive told myself next visit to chicago im not going to be so cheap first if you are on a budget there is nothing here that should preclude you from staying here you cant beat the location or the price the staff was as helpful as they could be  kelly did everything she could  but unfortunately we had three issues during our stay all of which could occur anywhere but it just seems too much for one trip first the remote control to the tv did not control our tv after i went down to the desk several times and five remotes later it still didnt work and i couldnt change the channels manually either so we had a choice of espn or nothing  not so great with two kids they did comp our rate for that night for this second the toilet overflowed kelly was the only one on duty and there was no maintenance people onsite at this 10 pm time so it took over an hour to get a plunger and fresh towels to solve the issue both of these items were resolved the next day while we were out and about but upon returning the second day after having walked all over the city alas our keys didnt work to let us back in the room so back down the slow elevator to get the keys reworked again they fixed it asap so they really do try i just think ill shell out a little bit more for a better chance at a nice relaxing stay next time,3.0
newly renovated large rooms in union square,i loved my stay at the abri  its a great location close to all the shopping on powell street forever 21 hm macys and they have done a great job with the rooms spacious especially for a boutique with great modern furnishings definitely recommend and would be back the staff is very genuine sweet and helpful,5.0
great downtown hotel close to the mall,"my daughter age 16 and i stayed at the holiday inn capitol from july 7  11 2005 we had a very pleasant stay
we arrived from nj via amtrak then took the metro from union station through gallery placechinatown to lenfant plaza 
the hotel is a short walk from the lenfant plaza metro station use the 7th avesmithsonian exit
when we arrived our room was ready i had emailed a request for early checkin it was approximately 1230 pm
our room had 2 double beds with 3 nicenot flat  pillows per bed had all the advertised amenities iron ironing board coffee maker etc air conditioner worked great you need it when it hits 95 degrees the bathroom had a lot of counter space to spread out if you need that 
got a great rate 124 per night through the holiday inn website  prepaid internet rate
we requested a refrigerator which was brought up from engineering was surprised that it was 5 per night extra  but i considered it worth it since we went to cvs right down the street for a few six packs of water for 250 per six pack whereas any tourist area it is 250 per bottle
must tell you that dining is not a priority with us  we are not interested in the dining experience we did not eat in the smithson restaurant because of the reviews that it got at this website however we did eat breakfast everyday at the smithson deli which is in the hotel right outside the restaurant area they had breakfast sandwiches bagels fruit juices coffee tea  selfserve and perfect for us just before sightseeing cost was approx 3 per person
we didnt find dining a problem we usually ate at restaurants before going back to the hotel however quiznos subs is open late and just down the block there is a mcdonalds also down the block we ate at union station basement level and 1st floor level has food 
our only disappointment was the crowded conditions at the rooftop pool  but to be expected in july even if you dont swim its worth a look at the marvelous capitol view check out the rooftop bunny rabbits i kid you not  we have pictures
wed definitely stay again",4.0
loved the hotel,we loved the hotel when i see other posts about it being shabby i cant for the life of me figure out what they are talking about rooms were large with two bathrooms lobby was fabulous pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym staff was courteous for us the location was greatacross the street from grant park with a great view of buckingham fountain and close to all the museums and theatres im sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the magnificent mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location got it for 105 on hotwire what a bargain for such a nice hotel,5.0
cannot say enough good about this hotel,stayed 2 nights4 adults room incl 2 teens staffoutstanding friendly helpful smiling respond to all requests roomtight but highly efficiently organized when we first walked in wondered how we would fit all our stuffno problem trendyvery contemporary were on 22nd flr with decent views comp breakfast  receptioncomplete and generous food was good you can likely skip dinner out the hors doeuvres are generous location12 block from subway 1 12 from times square quiet location safe  plenty of restaurants nearby cannot wait to get back to nyc  stay at this hotel,5.0
nice stay but small room,"i stayed in the hudson hotel in december for christmas shopping in new york
i had a nice stay the food in the restaurant was very delicious they have a cosy library where we enjoyed a cup of coffee
the room was very small but decorated in a nice way
the service at the reception was not so good",3.0
spacious beautiful rooms and great service,"my husband and i stayed at the hilton hotel times square for 3 nights on february 24 2012
the hotel rooms were spacious and well appointed we also ha a great view of manhattan from our 28th story room there are over 40 stories in the hotel with no rooms lower than the 15th floor i especially appreciated this very quiet room away from the noise and hustle and bustle of times square we could see the bright lights below but were high enough up that the bright lights didnt keep us awake or cause eyestrain when we looked out the window our sheets and towels were changed every day without asking i believe that there were also robes in the room which came in very handy we didint have time to visit the pool jacuzzi or exercise room but they were also spacious well equipped with all of the usual amenities what really made the hotel outstanding was the incredible concierge and staff service my husband and i were not familiar with manhattan and we received great directions and recommendations for restaurants entertainment transportation sightseeing the works all of the staff was well trained professional and had answers for every single question we asked and they seemed happy what a treat after staying in major hotels who have cut back service and amenities because of the recession and we received all of this in a great location for a mere 199 a night yes it was winter but we lucked out on the weather and it was easy to get theatre tickets sightseeing tours restaurant reservations the only thing i didnt like was that there are no hotel restaurants in sight when you enter the hotel they are all on upper levels and seemed inconvenient to access maybe they werent but we didnt look for them we had a drink at the beautiful hotel lobby bar one night and were stunned when the check was 32 for a johnny walker black scotch on the rocks for my husband and a glass of mediocre white wine for me they were double pours and it is manhattan but it still seemed steep also there was no entertainment in the hotel not even a piano bar this seemed odd to me given this is a 4 star hotel in a major urban area maybe everyone just goes to the theatre when they come to new york who knows other than these things which werent a big deal to us the hotel was the best deal weve had in a long time did i mention that we received triple hilton honors points for our stay there and earned another 25000 points by attending a fractional share presentation at the hilton near central park all in all it was a great value for us
one tip if you visit the big apple make a reservation for dinner absolutely anywhere you want to go especially in the theatre district even if youre eating very early or very late its the only way to get into the good restaurants you cant just walk into a restaurant with a good reputation even if its only moderately priced youll wait for at least an hour and maybe longer reservations and advance tickets are also good for the touritst attractions they save you time waiting in line and guarantee that you can see your chosen attraction when you want to it frees up your day for other things and maximizes your time in the big apple this is especially important during the tourist season which runs from spring to fall
also try aaa for discount theatre tickets they buy up blocks of seats all levels for the major shows and discount them around 40 you can get the tickets in advance so you dont have to stand in line at the discount places also pick up a copy of their nyc guidebook before you leave home its terrificincludes restaurants hotels sightseeing attractions shows entertainment the works",4.0
terrible customer service uncomfortable rooms disappointing general manager,"i booked through hotwire i accidentally booked the wrong nights and the assistant manager with hotwire on the phone agreed to a reduced rate for 2 nights the andaz still received my hotwire payment and we agreed i would pay the difference since it was my mistake i reiterated with the assistant manager i was traveling on business and needed to stay within a specific rate thought everything was ok since 2 colleagues recieved hotwire rates even much lower instead i was hassled and basically told i was a liar about the agreed upon rate by the general manager on my second day i was contacted to leave the hotel 3 times i explained i booked for 2 nights and confirmed again my rate
upon leaving the general manager looked at the note about my rate noticed the exact agreed upon amount i mentioned yet insisted there was a mistake i told him i was responsible for the amount above my already paid hotwire and he said the assistant manager who was not there should not have provided my lower rate he then proceeded to bill me over 100 above the rate he saw in the computer system when i approached him about this twice he said the assistant manager was not there and that until he figured out why i received such a low rate he would be forced to charge my credit card i mentioned again my two colleagues actually stayed through hotwire for a rate even lower and that i was willing to pay more just not the 100 more he was trying to charge me i also mentioned hotwire was on the phone to confirm and he even has a note in system with the agreed upon rate he said it is complicated because the manager should not have had the authority to do this essentially after the second time i stated it is an internal problem with the hotel and that he was essentially saying he did not believe the other managers note his response was that he would not bill my credit card until later that day and confirm with the manager so when i left i was charged over 100 above what was agreed and he wasted over 30 minutes of my time trying to explain this i had an afternoon business meeting and left without continuing to argue since it was clear he was going to charge my card anyway 
terrible customer service in addition the hotel was not that great the bathroom is weird and the shower points straight at your face so i basically had to duck to wash my hair the entire hotel is very snooty on the first night at the supposed hot spot rooftop bar the bartender told us the next night would be off and the greatest place in san diego and there would be a line but since we were in the hotel we would be good with wristbands well good thing we had wristbands for the lame 25 person scene the next night when we asked him he was like well come back on the weekend sorry the entire hotel is run by rude want to be black suit wearing wannabe new york nightclub bouncers",1.0
perfect for our trip needs,i had 9 other fire fighters with me to see the 911 site we used the valet service gym pool and business center during our stay i stayed in the jr suite with two others and it was perfect i would recommend if your activities are within walking distance to take the t to the hotel to avoid the valet charge,5.0
absolutely fantastic,"we stayed at this hotel from september 1216 i have seen the mixed reviews on here but thought the hotel looked very nice so we booked it through bookingcom we arrived early so our room was not ready yet but we just got to know the area which was nice i emailed the hotel when i booked and asked for a room on a high floor and when we checked in we got an amazing room on the 51st floor it was very nice and big with a great view of ts empire state building and chrysler building i thought the room was well kept and up to date the cleaning was also good all of the staff were nice and helpful 
the location is also great it only took seconds to walk to times square and avenue of the americas
we had a great stay here and would love to go back
i really would recommend this hotel to everyone do not hesitate booking this ",5.0
fancy but watch out for the valet parking,the hotel is beautiful and in a great location beware of the valet parking 26 but there is public parking very close that is much cheapter 11 it is a large hotel yet the room we stayed in was really large we asked for a king size bed and were told that normally it costs 20 more but ill waive it this time have never heard of an extra cost for a king size bed but since it was waived im giving the hotel the 5 stars it deserves,5.0
great conference venue if youre bringing the kids,"we were in town for a week at a conference with our two and four year old kids this place is within walking distance of the conference center and there are quite a few things to do nearby room was fine and ours had a view of the aircraft carrier which the kids loved so yes go for the bay view upgrade
breakfast and managers reception were obviously busy but we never had problems finding a table for four
only complaint for a summer stay would be that there is no outside pool so youre stuck in your room if you dont want to go outside having said that the foreshore park is close also decent restaurants are a few minutes walk away so bring the stroller and kiddyboard",5.0
great crash pad in good location in nyc,we stayed with our two teenage sons at the mave in june 2010 to celebrate my 40th birthday the hotel is in a convenient and walkable location to the main hub of nyc the rooms yes are small but have everything you need and are clean and maintained well i see from other reviews that it was noisy and yes it was but i have stayed in nyc before and that is part of the experience the city that never sleeps we were pretty exhausted with the sightseeing and jet lag so we slept through much of the noise anyway we loved the complimentary pastries and the coffee in the morning as it was booked on a room only basis the staff were friendly helpful and knowledgeable the only slight hitch was that we wanted rooms next dooron the same floor as we had out two teenage sons in a twin room unfortunately they were two floors down but i do put this down to our booking agent not requesting in time overall i would recommend the mave is you are having a whistle stop tour of the big apple,4.0
fashionable but lacking the basics,nice hotel with a very fashionable lobby nice restaurant attractive bar the room was large and nicely furnished but wifi was very slow and there wasnt any power outlets near the desk also they messed up our reservation and we almost had to change hotels on the middle of our holidays parking very expensive small pool on roof top  of the second floor  so enclosed by walls good service all around,3.0
best management and staff in any venue we have used to date,"the crowne plaza downtownsan jose was the host hotel for our dart league championship over the weekend the management and staff were absolutely the best we have ever encountered friendly efficient and a can do attitude from everyone

nice place inside,it was a nice place the beds were really comfy and all the furniture is brand new the outside appears a little sketchyits not in the best of neighborhoods it is also under major renovations but it super close to the beach and sea world the parking situation is bad they have a garage with really small spots and lots of people with suvs that go into a second spot alsothere was supposed to be a hair dryer in the room and they had not installed it yet overall the room was really nice,4.0
fantastic hotel superb staff great experience,recently returned from several nights at the standard east village and absolutely loved the hotel it is located in a perfect spot for exploring the city easy access to the subway yet within walking distance to all the cool areaseast village greenwich soho chelsea west village little italy meatpacking etc hotel design is sleek and modern the room was great those big windows make for a fantastic view the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed ive ever been in and particularly loved the huge tub housekeeping was thorough and efficient and worked like magic elves enjoyed a delicious breakfast daily on the penthouse level giving a gorgeous 360 view of nyc hotel lounge on second floor is so comfy too the entire staff was wonderful attentive courteous and very helpful in every aspect of the stay in particular fidel in the lobby and caroline behind the front desk who was indispensible with concierge services and suggesting sights shopping locales and restaurants throughout the big apple i will definitely stay here again hopefully soon as the entire staff at the standard east village made this a fantastic and memorable visit,5.0
cant wait to return,"not knowing exactly where the colonnade was located we were extremely pleased to find it right across the street from copley plaza and with an entrance to the subway right outside the front door
the rooms are efficiently equipped with work space and bright lights beds are very comfortable and the 37 flatscreentvs are great the staff at the hotel was very helpful and as a preferred hotel member all the amenities were provided with no problem workout facilities are generously equipped
the doorman was always available to call for a cab which are lined up outside thus there was no wasted time we will definitely choose the colonnade again",5.0

great option in seattle,"i loved this hotel it is new and welllocated i was in seattle on business and the hotel was very close to my destination the hotel is also walking distance to the space needle
the room is spacious with modern tecnology parking was available and very accessible breakfast was good and wellsupplied the front desk has a booklet of several restaurants that deliver at the hotel 
i think that with some much to see in seattle this hotel is perfect for its purpose it has all the basic necessities with a good price good location and modern rooms
i would definetely stay at this hotel again",5.0
lovely hotel and good value hotel for nyc,"we spent four nights at the park south hotel in june 2006 we paid around 200night for a queen size room this is a double by uk standards and were not disappointed the rooms were a good size very clean with a decent shower and nice toiletries if you are looking for somewhere merely to sleep and are not planning to spend too much time in your room then the size of the room is perfectly fine the room was nicely decorated and the bed very comfy we had an aircon unit which whilst a little noisy more irritating probably to those of use who are not used to getting air con units in hotel rooms kept the room cool 
the continental breakfast was great plenty to choose from the staff were really helpful and friendly the hotel is well located in midtown a 10 minute walk from the empire state building with a subway station at the end of the block which we made great use of i would definitely recommend use of the subway it is cheap and very easy to use and saves a lot of time and energy especially if you only have a few days in nyc 
the only downside to the hotel was that the first room we had cant remember the room number but it was on the same floor as the reception desk and quite near to the reception was located right next to the generators so it was very noisy i asked reception if we could move rooms but there were none available we had arrived at 930pm and it was the last room left however they did say that they would move us to a quieter room the next day and that they would move our bags if we left them in the room i was a little sceptical but lo and behold the next day on returning to the hotel we had been moved to the same size room a couple of floors up we could still here the generators but im guessing you could probably here them from most rooms anyway 
so i was very impressed by this and generally the quality of the hotel for the price i would definitely recommend it to anyone on a similar budget as it appears that most hotels of a similar quality in nyc are a lot more expensive than this one",4.0
our first visit to san francisco,we had an excellent stay at the chancellor hotel  excellent location close to everything including union square cheesecake factory sears and macys great accomodations and excellent service breakfast in the luques restaurant is a delightful experiencecheck the eggs benedict as well as the burrito with cheese avocado and baconit is huge and extremely deliciousthere is even a cable car stop almost in front of the hotel i checked several hotels in the area using trip advisor and i was surprised as to the high number of good ratings this hotel receives from other travellers after our stay i can only say that i am another happy traveller to be added to all travellers that have given high remarks for this hotel,5.0
great location but otherwise a mixed bag,we chose the sheraton to be close to universal studios and citywalk and it was brilliant for that the service we had during our stay was also excellent however the hotel itself is quite tired and dated  particularly the pool aeas and the rooms are small and do not have a fridge,3.0
rockamada you dont get what you pay for but location is key,i have stayed at the this place for years for a one nighter the rockamada as i like to call it is located across the street from two great music venues the ogden and fillmore you can walk across the street not drive and party it up the hotel also takes pets which is a big bonus they have a nice courtyard for the animals to play and go to the bathroom please pick up after your pet as far as the rates 12500 with tax a bit steep for the worn out and dirty rooms my socks were black from the nasty carpet the tv was ghetto the bathroom sink was clogged and it smelled funny in my room there was a smoking fine if you smoke in the room and my room smelled like smoke from the get go so make sure you drink a lot and just pass out if you plan on staying here,3.0
this place just keeps impressing me,"sometimes you stay at a hotel when its new and everyone is going out of their way to make it great come back a year later and it has slipped a notch not so here ive made multiple stays at this hotel and every time i visit someone goes out of their way to make it another great stay this time it was sunny appropriately named as he is a wealth of bright  cheery who put a smile on our faces as we walked through the door and continued to do so through our four day stay jamie who was ready to help with anything anytime and went out of his way to make us welcome it was especially nice since my sister who was new to new york was given the royal carpet treatment it was also great that nick took time to meet a special request 
the breakfast area is still wonderful though i wouldnt mind a little better coffee and fruit but the atmosphere makes up for it 
i called down that one of the light bulbs in the bathroom was burned out and the maintenance man was there within 5 minutes just cant beat this place great value on all fronts",5.0
very nice hotel in a great location,i stayed here 3 nights for a festival i was attending very close to all that is happening in times square my corner room had a fabulous view over the city and the hudson river would definitely stay here again,5.0
no complaints about the westin,we stayed at the westin times square on december 5 2004 and had a very nice stay with hotel prices so high for the holidays we didnt know if we would be able to stay in the city or not we actually had reservations to stay in nj but canceled because we really wanted to be in manhattan we then made reservations at the sheraton ny hotel and towers we had stayed at the sheraton manhattan in the summer and were very pleased with the hotel especially the friendly and helpful staff so when we were able to get a room at either sheraton for under 300 we decided to give the other one a try this time but then i looked on hotwire and saw a deal for a times square 4 star hotel for less than 200 i did a lot of research on various sites and deducted that the hotel was probably the westin at times square i had never used hotwire before but decided to give it a try and boy am i glad i did i purchased the hotel room for half the price of what i was going to pay for a comprable room the westin had mixed reviews on this site but i knew we wouldnt be spending much time in the room so im glad i took the gamble from checkin to checkout we did not have any complaints the rooms werent anything great but they were big enough for 2 adults and 2 preteens and most important  they were clean the lady that check us in was very accommodating  we were also able to check in early i asked for 2 double beds and a nonsmoking room and got it without hesitation it was raining the next morning and we were given complimentary umbrellas to use for the rest of our stay the bellhops were great we stayed a sunday night and the hotel was not very busy and the elevators were alway quick to take us where we needed we stored our luggage after checking out and they were very helpful if the price is right we would stay at the westin again,4.0
lovely but not sure it deserves such high praise,"perhaps its because this hotel is the 1 rated hotel in all of la but it didnt quite live up to our expectations
on the plus side the staff are absolutely brilliant and really made us feel welcome and at home  so thank you guys location is great for travelling around la and seeing the sights  also for yamashiro which is much better than its web reviews and of course the magic castle if thats your thing parking is free and secure though a bit of a chore if you have a big vehicle wifi and nibblesdrinks in your room are free which is a lovely touch
why only 3 stars then to be honest the place is pretty tired and in need of a refit whilst the pool is tiny you know all this when you stay there so its not so much of an issue the major issue for us was noise  we had a road facing room make sure you ask not to have one of these and the traffic keeps going all night so you cant have the window open even if you have the windows closed it remains seriously noisy the air con units are old and very noisy so the only way to get to sleep at all is with earplugs sorry guys i know theres not much you can do about this but to be fair to all i had to make this clear 
if we hadnt had a road facing room im sure i would have rated this as a 4 so dont get me wrong its a very nice place to stay",3.0

its located in a large sprawling lifestyle center with numerous options for eating drinking and even fine dining we only went to one of the restaurants but really enjoyed the environs
the bed was luxuriously comfy thanks for having us hotel sorella",4.0
great location staff and room,was a great choice the first time a few years ago so we stayed here again last month we visit dc for the musems the history the memorials etc this is a big hotel that is well run and clean the staff is very friendly and helpful this is the best location for a dc tourist and is now my hotel of choice for my future visits to dc,5.0
what a great place to stay,this is our second visit as we stayed in the hotel about 5 years ago the hotel carlton is very well located near union square on sutter near hyde the union square area cable cars and the theatre district are a close walk the hotel although quite old has been very well modernized and has walk in closets safes etc the two elevators although cosy are fun to ride the best thing about the hotel carlton is the staff they are all very friendly courteous and knowledgeable respecting the city it is just like speaking to a friend they also multi task as theo checked us in provided tips on restaurants and driving in san francisco and then played the keyboard to entertain us during the reception in the afternoon the wine reception in the lobby between 530 and 600 pm was always a highlight with many of the guests in the hotel all in all i would certainly recommend the hotel carlton to my friends and we will definitely stay there again when we travel back to san francisco the only negative is that a fire station is close by and if it is a busy night the sirens may be a distraction,5.0
needs a refresh,i stayed just one night whilst on my way back from new york where i had just stayed in the hilton times square it was a lot less expensive in chicago but i also got a lot less i was upgraded to a suite and the room was quiet large and perfectly fine however everything about this hotel needs a refresh and refit the carpets wallpaper windows and fittings are definitely not modern the room was dark because the windows were small there was a scrolling video in the elevator that mentioned a 185m refurbishment in 1984 and it was said to be the largest most ambitious 1 year project at the time my thought was that it is high time for another one im not sure i would stay at this hotel again as there is a lot of choice in chicago but for what i paid and the excellent location i cant complain i also left my toilet bag behind and when i called the security desk they were particularly accommodating giving me clear directions as to how to get it back,3.0
super hotel,wow great hotel great location from the moment we entered the hotel we had a fantastic experience all the staff were more the helpful and friendly and went out of their way to make our first visit to nyc extra special the club level room is quite spacious with a phenomenal bathroom we like to stay at westins because of the heavenly bed room service was quick and tasty and despite the location and its high level of occupancy the hotel was very quiet this was our best stay at a westin yet well be back,5.0
worked out great will go back,convenient to everything staff was hospitable and responsive room was right for a short stay by myself comfortable bed clean quiet enough not on the street side equipment worked supplies were adequate,4.0
beautiful hotel awesome staff excellent accomodations,we were there for my stepdaughters wedding she had everything right there at the hotel and it was absolutely perfect beautiful setting and extremely accomodating staff elevators are very slow but plan ahead and that is okay too,5.0
top of the line,the omni is an excellent hotelnot only are the rooms large but they are well cared for we stayed for three nights during the cherry blossom festival and it was a real pleasure to get out of the crowds and spend quiet time here we were traveling with a teenager and a 9 year old and we were very comfortable in letting them go to the lobby alone for snacks and such i had heard terrible things about wdc but this hotel made all the difference the red line metro is only a short walk from the hotel and the trolley is accross the streetloved it about two blocks away you can get anything from lebaneze food to burgers at the fast food jointsonly thing is the pool doesnt open until mayotherwiseexcellent,5.0
a very classy hotel,my wife and i stayed for one night on a package that included valet parking room and breakfast all for a very reasonable rate everything we experienced from check in to check out was first class it seems all of the people who work at the hotel are osu students but what they lack in experience they make up for in enthusiasm and effort our king room was large well appointed and everything was immaculate we ate at the small lounge following checkin and sandwiches and burgers were excellent the breakfast buffet included fresh omlettes and waffles nothing at the hotel is ostentatious or overdone its just a really nice hotel among the nicest ive ever stayed at,5.0
nice for the price,stayed here for business and found it very pleasant the location was good a few blocks from shops restaurants etc neighborhood seemed safe and fairly quiet i have read complaints about the service and found the exact opposite to be true when i checked in they assigned me to a room and when i got to the room the housekeeping staff was still finishing up not only did i get multiple apologies but managment sent up a delicious bottle of wine along with snacks for my trouble i only waited in the hall for 2 minutes i asked for feather pillows and they arrived in under 5 minutes my room was very clean and quiet but had the oddest shape with a good deal of unusable space the bathroom setup no real vanity area was a little weird this is not a full service hotel with lots of extras but with the prices in washington it had good value location and a very pleasant staff,3.0
pleasant enough,we were only in seattle for one night before a cruise so chose this for convenience although it is very close to the space needle precinct it was too far away from downtown to walk comfortably and staff were only variably helpful re taxis the rooms were ok for the price i guess this was i think staff accom for a company so the rooms are a bit larger than normal and had a small kitchenette which could be useful if you were staying a few days our first room was at the front smelled odd and we couldnt open the windows the one they very helpfully changed us to at the back was better re smell with opening windows facing straight onto a brick wall but hey for the price i guess not bad and do try the fantastic breakfast place over the road  the one with the queues outside,3.0
perfect for us,"we got a terrific price through another websitesorry tripadvisorhowever i wanted to share here we had a really nice suite everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful 
i had problems with the free wificalled the front destk and within just a few minutes a gentleman came to our room and got me hooked up without a problem 
breakfast was includedusual free hotel fareself made waffles cold cereal yogurt bagels etc the only down side was the eggs and ham the eggs were not freshtasted like powdered the ham was dry and over cooked 
a nice fitness room and indoor pool our grandkids visited us and had a ball in the pool
everything was clean and well cared for we will stay here again when we visit columbus",5.0
they overbooked us and we had to move way out of town,i had booked and prepaid for this hotel i confirmed 2 days before we arrived late check in guaranteed we arrived after a long drive from vancouver only to find there was no room for us they did arrange for us to stay at another hotel in seattle miles away at lake union evidently there were no other rooms available in the downtown area the checkin agent seemed put out to have to relocate and accommodate us he did arrange for us to have a car service with one transfer downtown it would only take 5 minutes for the car to arrive we moved hotels and called the car service only to be told it would arrive in roughly 90 minutes this was supposed to be the capoff of a long 10 day vacation and it turned out to be a horrible experience i would not recommend this hotel to anyone especially after the poor service they showed in dealing with their mistake in overbooking us,1.0
good corner rooms friendly ambience,stayed during the recent heat wave front desk extremely friendly corner rooms are neatly arranged and pleasant we received a bottle of wine for our anniversary stayed on aquarium package which is a great deal if planning to visit with young children valet parking 36 a bit expensive,4.0
just avoid the rooms at the front,"we had room 201 it seems that there are two rooms on each floor facing the street i would avoid these especially the ones on the 2nd floor
we had a the hotel sign right outside our window and it was lit up with very bright lights that we could not block to add to that there was whooping and hollering on the street until past 2 am and this was a monday night it all added up to a terrible nights sleep
the next morning i asked for a quieter room which was accommodated though we got a pullout sofa instead of a second bed but the room was extremely quiet
location as others have stated was excellent right in the heart of the historic district very very convenient
staff was friendly rooms were clean no complaints other than the noise in those front rooms
we were a little disappointed in the breakfast maybe its just me but when i think of belgian waffles i think of fresh fruit whipped cream etc these were make your own with only syrup pretty basic and filled the need but still not what was expected
i would recommend this hotel",3.0
horrible customer service hotel is courtyard standard,"my family and i just experienced a very unpleasant stay at the renaissance washington dc hotel at 999 ninth st nw washington dc dc 20001
im really not one to complain about experiences unless they go drastically wrong and i must also offer the disclaimer that i work in the hotel industry but i dont think any of these issues are that knitpicky or absurd not to insult my own knowledge or anyone who is reading this review but it would be easier if i just listed the problems and issues that ive encountered 
things wrong at the hotel
we were given a handicap accessible room upon checkin im an employee i know things like this happen i was willing to excuse it as we made a special request upon checkin
stinkbug wrapped in toilet paper in our new room picture 1
toilet paper was used
no remote at checkin called at your service and stopped by fd fd was less than apathetic after hearing about the lack of a remote and the bug in the room only saying thank you for letting us know
4 hours later still no remote i called down to at your service again and told them that i called and stopped by the front desk four hours ago and i still did not have a remote much to my surprise the female on the phone told me in a harsh tone you might have stopped by the front desk but you didnt call i said excuse me she repeated you might have told the front desk but ive been here since 200pm you did not call ive never been talked to that way by a service professional it was a sign of things to come
we spent 20 minutes looking for ice on floors 1015 with a sign on our floor saying the ice machine was out of order but instructing us to use the machine on the 15th floor which was also out of order
only two towels in the room for a luxury brand more than two towels should be expected 
espn ch8 was not working called maintenance and told us it hasnt been working for a long time thats it no further assistance offered i asked if they could get it fixed and they said they would call tomorrow
drilling hammering banging and other construction on the roof at 730am front desk says theres nothing i can do about it it was such an absurd hour to start construction especially without notification i asked to speak to a manager
manager lauren offers no help even after i tell her about my horrific stay so far and inform her that i have a list of complaints instead she only says im sorry you feel that way
noise complaints 3 times our final night at 1145pm 230am and 430am they had us in a room in the middle of the university of marylands football team so it was extremely noisy every night that we were there i dont understand why we were put in such a precarious location
at this point i realized that no one at the hotel was going to be of help to me i never even got so much as an im sorry and it was useless to further voice my complaints at the hotel level",1.0
a real dump that does not live up to drurys usual standards,"this place is very worn down and not well kept i would avoid it at all costs and i am baffled by the positive reviews that led me to stay here i had stayed in a drury in nashville a couple of years ago and so had expected this to be much much better
to make matters worse our room stunk of disinfectant or some such cleaning product that made us all fill queasy we asked if we could be moved to another room but there were four of us and there were no rooms available with two beds there were four of us so that didnt work",1.0
simply beautiful,theres a trendy elegence to hotel indigo that understands the quality of everything the hotel provides beautiful room sheets and pillows are heavenly bathroom had the ambiance of a spa and couldnt be better roof top openair lounge beautifully done fitness center small but never crowded  and perfectly outfitted great view too bar on the ground level is beautiful  and since this is san diego the windows are opened accordianstyle to united the space with the outdoors perfect this was a business trip so i didnt bring a pet  but i could have hotel indigo is unobtrusively petfriendly but i didnt know it without asking what more can i say walking distance to restaurants  club as well as the convention center and i had a great view of the baseball stadium from my room this was my first visit to wonderful san diego ca and hotel indigo couldnt be better,5.0
always receive splendid service at the omni westside,"i stay frequently at this hotel on business trips and they know how to look after their frequent travellers
that said even without the perks of being a special guest this is a very comfortable hotel the design is interesting  an all glass facade surrounds a very large atrium with a large pool of fish and a waterside restaurant outside there is for a hotel a large open air swimming pool which is open for much of the year 
there is also a gift shop which double up as a starbucks the dark and atmospheric western  style bar which is open until quite late is typically strewn with peanut shells on the floor 
the rooms are comfortable with a plethora of pillows and cushions on the bed flat screen tv and for a small fee you can even request a treadmill in your room if you dont want to use the hotels own fitness room the service is always friendly and personalised
if i have to be picky and i know the hotel well the service in the restaurant is sometimes very slow and there are few low calorie options on the menu the hotel is slowly moving towards an ecooffering  most hotels have for a long time offered the option of reusing towels for example but given that the clientele is mostly the oil industry i imagine that the hotel management hasnt felt very driven to adopt this approach thank goodness they finally have",5.0
id use it again  then again i have used it 3 times in the last 12 months,"first the negatives  you get dumpsters across the street through the night taking away trash from the apartmentoffice buildings and theres currently building work going on at neighbouring buildings oh and every other morning the breakfast meat option is that curious deep fried or grilled pork fat that seems to pass as bacon in the usa
positives  in your room there is a white noise machine and earplugs to dull the dumpster noise and the management recognises it as a problem on the mornings when you dont have grilled pork fat there are some really nice sausage patties to go with the scrambled eggs unlimited toast and waffles coffee juices and dairy options
the rooms are very clean the beds are very comfortable albeit shallow there is a bath as well as a shower the work space is more than adequate about the same size as my office desk it is in an ideal situation for my customer sites the rates are reasonable the staff are great the manager mr weed will do whatever he can to assist in your stay
it is a few blocks from times suare and broadway and i walked the length of 5th ave up to central park and back comfortably
if you have ordinary needs give this hotel a look i have marked it down a bit on value solely because there isnt a value for money hotel in manhattan  they all are overpriced",4.0
highly recommended,"this was the second time i have stayed in this hotel and i couldnt fault it 
the hotel is ideally located to all the major attractions and there is a subway station right next to it 
the hotel room was quite spacious which is a rarirty in manhatten and the complimentary bliss products are superb 
when we arrived we found that our hotel room safe wasnt working we called down to the concierge and someone was upto the room within 5 minutes to fix it
if you have had a busy day and cant be bothered to go out for an evening meal the in room dining is well worth a look especially the pizza
i would personally ignore all of the negative reviews as we all know if you look hard enough we could all find negatives",4.0
always on point,i love this hotel it is in the heart of downtown its beautiful and clean and everyone is always so helpful there is a disconnect though with their business center they charge and arm and legs for anything example i got charged over 150 for the business center just to call me and tell me my fedex packages had arrived they didnt even touch them i went downt here myself and loaded them in my suv i talked to the hotel but was informed they are seperate so they couldnt provide any help its unfortuante because i would likely look to hosting more meetings and events here if there wasnt that disconnect because the space is beautiful and the actual sheraton staff is always on point,4.0
great downtown location no frills,great location reasonable price clean no frills polite hotel staff the bed was comfortable the bathroom was functional but really outdated if you are looking for a budget hotel with a great location this is a good bet,3.0
a big thank you to the whitehall hotel,"we planned a trip from the uk to chicago following a fab trip to new york the year before and we love the states chicago is an amazing city and we loved every minute of it people are so helpful and friendly the hotel made the trip even better although the bed was so comfy i could have quite happily stayed in it for the whole trip the hotel is in a great location staff were polite and helpful we got a paper delivered everyday to the room beds were made up and bathroom cleaned daily our room was a good size and well equiped
before we left we read some of the negative comments on here about the hotel firstly bed bugs we had none in our room but when we went to new york we had read the same about the hotel there and again didnt have a problem secondly some people had said the furniture and decor was dated i personally loved the old worldy look of the halls and yes the carpet had seen better days in the room but it was clean yes the toilet was in an odd place in the bathroom but it wasnt an issue i wasnt planning on spending my holiday in there
i guess what i would say to people is that if your used to staying in a modern high end 3 star plus hotel this hotel wont be for you if you want a place to get your head down in while enjoying the amazing city of chicago and you want a place thats clean and quaint and a bargin then this is for you and its in a great location
i would like to thank the staff at the hotel for a great stay we would definatly stay with you again you made it a holiday to remember and we really miss chicago",5.0
talk about customer service,stayed for 3 nights this past week and loved every minute the hotel staff are very friendly and genuinly care about their guests it just shows the location of the hotel is perfect if you like to be smack in the middle of the action the rooms are very comfortable  nicely decorated and soundproof the 2nd floor lobby is great to hang out in it features the r lounge where we and friends met for a surprise party for my wifes birthday the staff at the lounge made us feel more than special just a great time was had by all i will definitely stay here again,5.0
terrific value very little to complain about,"i stayed here with 3 friends and we got a terrific rate of usd180night inc taxes which ended up proving to be unbeatable value
the room at hampton was more than big enough to accommodate the four of us in the same room even with a couch desk and large tv the room still felt spacious the decor was adequate and the bathroom was good enough to fulfill all basic needs
there were always several staff downstairs ready to help with inquiries and requests and most importantly i felt like they were happy and willing to help people out they even gave out free bottles of water
the free buffet breakfast has been praised continuously and not without reason there is always hot food bagels danishes muffins toasts cakes juices fruits and a wide range of cereal theyre not joking when they say their breakfast is the best the choice of taking food to your room is a nice option 
location is also excellent as the hotel is only about 5 minute walk to both times square and central park there is also the frequent blue line subway just downstairs from the hotel dont forget that the blue line can take you to the airport also
the only complaint my friends came up with is that there are many more hotels that give you a new york feel since that is rather subjective anyway i think most people wont mind checking out with the wow this place has been a bargain feel instead",4.0
very pleased,my family stayed at the wilshire crest the week before christmas and we were very pleased very reminiscent of inns in europe the location is great museums very close walking distance to the farmers market and the grove third avenue shops and restaurants close to beverly hills etc the rooms are large spotlessly clean beds have very good mattresses and nice linens the neighborhood is a lovely residential area which seemed very safe the complimentary breakfast is a cut above what you usually receive parking was onstreet and we were always able to find a spot close to the hotel the only problem is that you can hear other guests walking in the halls the room above younoise seemed to travel easily however it did not bother us as it took place during waking hours and was very quiet at night room rate was a very good value for los angeles,5.0
home base for a dream vacation,we booked our new york vacation through air miles and after considering a couple of options decided on the new yorker we were not disappointed this is a great hotel with small but comfortable rooms and great security for 10 a night we upgraded to a roomwithaview and it was worth every penny we were in a corner room and out of one window had a view of the chrysler building the empire state building a few blocks away and penn station and madison square garden just below out of the other window we had a partial view of the hudson river and all the buildings north of the hotel it seems like a small thing but theres something magical about being able to look out over the city at night the lighting on the empire state building changes from time to time it was green for st patricks day the great thing about the new yorker is that its within walking distance of many local attractions  times square broadway st patricks cathedral the rockefeller centre moma 5th avenue if youre ambitious you can even walk to the 911 memorial about 2 miles and central park there are many excellent restaurants in the area and its an easy walk to local favourites like grimaldi pizza and brooklyn bagels the chinese restaurant just a block away chef yu was excellent for a great lunch take the subway down to 369 broome street for a sub sandwich at saigon vietnamese sandwich one of the best meals all week was the thai dinner we ate at bangkok house 360 west 46th just a healthy walk from the hotel the bed in our room was extremely comfortable and after walking miles every day we slept well the housekeeping service was good  almost too good  as sheets and towels were changed even when they didnt need to be the smallness of the room wasnt a factor most of the time but the absence of a second chair meant that one of us had to sit on the bed while watching television rare or using the hotels free internet the free internet tended to be a little slow but we decided against the upgrade to premium internet for around 10 per day the souvenir shop in the basement of the hotel was well stocked and reasonably priced if youre considering taking a doubledecker bus tour the consensus seemed to be that the gray line is more reliable than the city sights competitor we had prebooked with city sights and overall it was pretty good however one afternoon on the uptown tour we hopped off at the metropolitan museum and never did hop back on every bus that came by was full with others who had hopped back on there were about ten very tired and frustrated people still waiting when we decided to take a cab back to our hotel anyway it was a fabulous week and having a great comfortable hotel like the new yorker as our home base had a lot to do with making this the vacation of a lifetime,5.0
great location clean very friendly staff,the staff were terrific  warm friendly and chatted with my daughter like any other respected guest clean modern rooms free wifi loved the french restaurants in the area and the rooftop terrace easy to get around town from there the hotel restaurant could use some kidfriendly selections would stay here again,5.0
good quality hotel,"for the price i am so glad my boyfriend and i stayed in the tribeca area as it is a lot less touristy than uptown  and cheaper too
rooms basic smallish not a great view and tiny bathroom but all we did was sleep here so did not bother us in the slightest they were very very clean rooms maids cleaned and left fresh towels every day
staff were ok not the type to go out of their way to help and some better than others but on the whole fine plenty of handy leaflets maps etc in reception
i would not hesitate in recommending this hotel  dont go expecting room service and stunning rooms  you wont get it here
but if you are looking for a very clean well located laid back convenient hotel  this is for you slightly too commercialised uptown for me  i prefer the uniqueness of tribeca and surrounding areas like greenwich village etc
also did the sex and the city tour which was great
note  the american museum of natural history and museum of art are a waste of time guggenheim looks good on the outside ok inside because we spent so much time at these places we missed out on the museum of modern art  but that looks great so id only bother with that
ice skating at central park tip  go skating at sundown  its amazing to watch it get dark over manhattan while you skate
went to see chicago and also phantom  both great  but i cannot believe the lack of dress standards at the theatre  some people were wearing trainers and people were staring at my partner and i for beng dressed smartly in evening wear very strange  not like england in this sense at all cannot understand why this city is labelled city of style  no carrie bradshaws to be seen 
the best guide book is the aa spiral guide",4.0
excellent hotel  top quality  good prices and friendly helpful staff,we stayed at hotel on the ave on 77th and broadway and it was a fabulous choice the location was perfect for what we wanted to see and do our nicely decorated rooms were spacious and the shower stall in our modern bathroom was big enough for a mom to wash five kiddies at the same time we got a newspaper outside our door and coffee was served in the lobby each morning there was free wifi in the lobby as well however most important to us was the genial hotel staff who offered service with a smile each and every time we requested it when journeywoman realized she had left her iphone power cord at home the assistant manager happily shared his with her and saved the day plus there were two female conscierge desks in the lobby and those girls knew their stuff this hotel definitely earned a jw gold star rating from us our group all agreed wed come back here in a new york minute,5.0
great value for the dollar,terrific location very clean room that appeared to have been updated recently including crisp linens very clean bathroom flat screen tv friendlyhelpful staff small room but its nyc  youre only in the room to sleepshower,5.0
top hotel in top location,after reading loads of reviews on this hotel mostly good but some bad we bit the bullet and booked it and thank god we did we love the les so many great bars restaurants cafes and shops within a stones throw of the hotel check schillers for dinner and a drink 1 block away and grab an awesome crepe for breakfast on the opposite corner of the hotel we have a room on the 14th floor looking uptown directly at the empire state and have had magnificent sunsets to watch from our room each night i am looking at one as i write this the staff have all been lovely and extremely helpful with everything we have needed we have had complimentary freshly baked cookies dropped off to us in the evening the room has been cleaned well and promptly every day and the tempur beds are wonderful  a little different at first but we love them great bathroom amenities nice powerful shower comfy bath robes and a well stocked minibar for the money this hotel is a winner if you want to be downtown a 5 minute walk to soho and east village rooms are a good size for nyc standards we have a sitting area and 2 large suitcases and we can still move around easily and free wifi love hotel on rivington x,4.0

fabulous location,this hotel has the perfect location for taking in all of nyc sights from a walking distance central park is only two blocks away 5th avenue shopping is around the corner times square the theater district garment district and numerous other tourist destinations are just a convenient walk away the hotel rooms are small but typical for nyc standards the rooms are suites with kitchenettes for convenient in room breakfasts and snacks our room was always immaculately cleaned each day the staff at the front desk and concierge desk were helpful and friendly we were able to access wifi in our room we did not use the pool or fitness center but they appeared clean and easily accessible as in all nyc hotels in addition to the room fees we were met with an additional hospitality fee per night when we arrived this information had been emailed to me ahead of time but i still did not appreciate that this was a mandatory fee regardless of whether or not we used the hotels facilities business center pool gym etc all in all though i would definitely return and stay again,4.0
comfortable hotel good location,"stayed for 5 nights with my wife for our 3rd trip to nyc decent location on corner of 50th and 3rd same avenue as rockerfeller plaza so a manageable walk to pretty much anywhere uptown and decent subway links only a couple of blocks away 
hotel pretty quiet apart from building works early on first morning from 7am for which the manager left a note under the door very apologetic and it didnt happen again
good comfortable rooms very clean massive great bed hotel lounge on 2nd floor is nice for relaxing but no bar which is a bit of a shame but pjclarkes on 55th and 3rd just up the road is highly recommended for drinks and food  try the blueberry crumble wow 
a friend recommended this to me after staying there and although not the cheapest i would definitely pass this on too",4.0
a lovely stay at the roosevelt,booked a last minute stay at the roosevelt hotel for a new year weekend break and had a lovely experience in this hotel on arrival we were greeted by a very helpful receptionist who offered us a complimentary breakfast and drinks in the bar  a nice way to welcome us to the hotel the lobby was very festive and very inviting our room a standard king was a good size and was clean and comfortable the bath  body works toiletries were a nice addition the bar is very cosy and there was a lot of choice for breakfast its in a great location near grand central station times square and the rockerfeller center we would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to others,4.0
fantastic stay outstanding service,it is very rare to have a flawless hotel stay but the omni chicago did it with one minor exception we booked five nights and were contacted ahead of our stay by mrs avellana the loyalty ambassador she wanted to make sure that we have a pleasant stay and we did gorgeous quiet and clean corner room with plenty of views the staff service was outstanding from checkin to departure high notes for housekeeping and room service we tried the restaurant several times and the food and service were outstanding  try the smoked salmon flatbread for a breakfast change the buffet is great too location cannot be beaten the only thing to improve wireless internet connection on floor 24 war bad to nonexistent we were never able to connect to the omni router extremly weak signal and used our wireless broadband card instead without any problems vwell be back soon thanks mrs avellana f diederichs,5.0
fantastic hotel,had really enjoyable four night stay in this very clean and modern hotel a very short walk from all the attractions in the seattle centre and well located for monorail to downtown room was well equipped with microwave and popcorn fridge safe and plasma tv afternoon coffee and cakes along with complimetary bicycles were a nice touch extremely friendly and helpful staff would definitely stay here again for any future visits to seattle,5.0
second stay this year,"great breakfast never replaced spa door handle nor filled spa in dec for over a week and extensive renovations and messes however i still highly recommend this hotel it is a great value and recently renovated i like the old fashioned option of a tub it is conveniently located near the airport and they send the shuttle and allow the shuttle to fetch you to and from the light rail or you can walk from it
so this is an inexpensive option to see seattle even if it is far from downtown they might have fridges and microwaves available for little extra cost and they have enormous discounts on weekly stays
i also stayed there in may when there was no renovations
i will definitely stay there again as i have business conferences in the double tree across the street
this hotel is very clean in general and suitable for anyone not requiring a four star or better hotel",4.0
loved this hotel,"this was our first time travelling to new york i spent hours on tripadvisor researching hotels i am so happy we chose this one yes the rooms are small we travelled with our two teenage children and found it a little tight but it was extremely clean and i always prefer a newer hotel the location was perfect for us you could easily walk north totimes square rockefeller plaza and central park we also walked south to soho tribeca little italy and chinatown if walking isnt your thing the subway is about a 2 minute walk on the corner of 28th and 7th ave it was easy to take the subway north to central park and then down to greenwich village or further south to south ferry
there are only 7 rooms on each floor ours was at the back of the building which didnt have much of a view however we didnt hear the chimes from the elevator which i believe the rooms on the front with the view of the empire state building would listen to all night long i am not sure why in a hotel this size with two elevators they need the chimes
this street is all flower shops so walking to and from the hotel every morning and evening was wonderful the sidewalks are covered in beautiful flowers and shrubs and the scent was lovely
the breakfast was typical for a fairfield inn and there was no trouble finding something to please everyone 
the staff was fantastic especially mia she was extremely helpful and always had a cheerful hello each evening we would head up to the rooftop patio and enjoy the incredible view of the empire state building we will definitely stay at this hotel again",4.0
club floor is the way to go,the room was beautiful and perfect in every way especially enjoyed the club floor breakfast and cocktail hour club room food selection had a wide variety and a very comfortable atmosphere,5.0
great place to stayclose to mayo clinic,we are staying at the jameson inn due to my husbands visits to mayo clinic the jameson is only 9 miles away from the clinic the rooms are clean and inviting the staff is very friendly and accomodating they offer a wonderful continental breadfast including biscuits  gravy we have even stayed in the spacious and emmaculate handicap room great value also for the jacksonville area you need to stay here as it is close to several eating establishments to accomodate most tastes close to 95 and direct route to the beach also,5.0
terrible dont make the same mistake as mine,"i just chose this hotel because i checked this website and it is 49 in popularity how come
the place is awful smells bad nonsecure linens are old disgusting the window was broken there is no concierge and the staff cannot even indicate tourist spots i paid usd170 per night and i really felt stupid 
the location is not that great either there is nothing in that area at night not even a cafeteria i was just guided by the hotel popularity and i did the worst possible deal in chicago
i will never stay there again and do not recommend to anyone",1.0
overbooked doubledup or walked,"booked and confirmed two nights here last weekend my wife and kids were in ny for the open despite confirmation we were told they were overbooked never had this happen before our options were to have all of us stay in one room small suite or walk to a hyatt which was 78 blocks away
tired and frustrated we decided to stay on a pull out and rollout
to their credit the room was clean and the service staff was welltrained as a meeting planner this type of problem makes one pause

fish palace,"hotel was cheap so didnt expect much it was clean and basic but slightly further out that i would have liked
main problem was that after the room had been cleaned each day the bathroom absolutely stank of fish i have no idea what they cleaned it with but the smell was very bad as there were no bathroom windows and only a small window in the bedroom it was a case of having to get used to it",2.0
updated well kind of suites in fantastic neighborhood and location,"the river inn is a pretty recently updated hotel in the adorable quiet neighborhood of foggy bottom just 25 blocks to the metro foggy bottomgwu on the blueorange line i stayed with two other people for three nights in a nicesized corporate suite which includes a queen bed sofabed desk flatscreen tv kitchenette and dressing area outside the bathroom
at first glance the room is very very nice and brandnew as the photos on their web site would have you expect the furniture made the room look very modern the dressing room had a large mirror and marble counter  this space really let us spread out when you start looking around through three things give away the age of the building the kitchenette the bathroom and the curtains the kitchenette was everything we needed for a quick stay but the appliances were pretty old same for the bathroom  the glass shelf along the mirror made everything look modern and polished but the fixtures just dated the place the tiles in the shower needed a good cleaning the towel bar was the kind with porcelain holder on either side of a plastic foursided rod my sister who was traveling with me and i agreed that it reminded us of the bathroom in our grandmothers house that was built in the 1950s the rooms curtains were tattered and frayed with holes in them
overall the room was very clean and comfortable and a great value under 200 a night but just a few little updates could really take the room to the next level",4.0
great location,"we stayed at thewit over labor day weekend for a wedding  so do note that we paid a group rate which is whoknowshowmuchless than a normal rate 
the location of this hotel is superb really easy to get everywhere l stations nearby you can walk practically anywhere the service was also quite good  we arrived super early around 1030am expecting to be told we needed to just leave our bags and check in later nope got checked right in given delicious cookies and brought up to our room the room was great  comfy bed everything you need the only thing lacking was a fanvent in the bathroom so it got quite steamy when you showered the concierge was also very helpful  gave us quick and easy directions to wrigley field 
for anyone doing their wedding here thought id briefly mention my experience with this hotel as a guest at the wedding we were told that the wedding cocktail hour would be on the roof  and based on the website that seemed really exciting unfortunately it was only a partial section of the roof and it was indoors which i thought was somewhat disappointing it was also much too loud and too crowded the rest of the wedding  ceremony and reception in one of the ballrooms  was great we had a blast 
the crowds going up to the roof in the evenings were a bit of a turnoff really sceney and totally not where id want to hang out but you only really interact with them in the lobby and potentially the elevator i just ignored them and was fine we specifically asked for a floor away from the roof  we preferred to risk train noise of which we heard nothing to barparty noise id definitely stay here again its hip great location good amenities and great service",4.0
great hotel option near seatac,i had heard that cedarbrook was an oasis near seatac and finally gave it a shot myself i was pleased to find everything i heard was correct my daughter had an early morning flight there was confusion about the charge for parking but the front desk made that right the room was comfortable and the living room conceptsnacks in each wing of the complex is a great idea the early morning shuttle was on time the to go box breakfast for my daughter was waiting as promised my wife and i enjoyed the free breakfast and the surroundings before departure the lodge feels more like a mountain retreat than an airport hotel i will certainly stay again when i have an early morning flight out of seatac,5.0
stay well clear of this hotel,"my colleague and i arrived on the 26th october having flown in from the uk we asked where the restaurant was and were told we do not have a restaurant we had to close it down and refurbish the whole kitchen so tired and hungry we asked where we could get a quick meal and were told  i dont know im not from these parts 
our first rooms were dirty my sofa was clearly broken and my colleagues room smelt of mould so we changed our rooms and were given a junior suite at no extra charge we were assured breakfast would be a a range of cereals and pastries  plus coffee etc  i woke up at 3 am in the morning to hear my neighbour chatting on his phone as the walls were paper thin and the room again smelt so badly of mould that i was wheezingso i changed again 
later my colleague and i went down for breakfast only to discover that breakfast was a muffin nothing else we asked for a drink of water and were told we do not have water on asking the staff to show us the gym one smiled and said well thats a kind of a jokehe was rightneedless to say we checked out and moved to the hyatt 
this hotel we were informed on arrival had just gone through a bankruptcy and was being refurbished my advice would be to knock it down and start afreshdo not believe the pictures on any of the websites re this hotelthey are extremely misleading",1.0
fabulous location,"excellent location a block away from the magnificent mile restaurants everywhere
the hotel even provides breakfast and dinner mth the food was good they even served beer and wine friendly dining room staff

mutton dressed as lamb look but dont stay,"our stay was at the end of a five month tour round the world and we felt this was a safe hotel to book as this is the waldorf astoria and having good experiences with the brand elsewhere we thought we would finish here in new york 
we were wrong 
i can only retell our experience here but i spoke with other guests and heard many similar stories i can only presume that good reviews for this hotel are from those who did not stay here or who have never stayed at a good hotel
the first room was old tired and not clean it actually had broken glass on the floor of the bathroom we couldnt believe it we went back to reception and were assured an upgrade in light of this so we went to a smaller room with a smaller bed this was unacceptable so we went back to reception again this time we were given a large suite of two room size and were then informed that there was no water on our floor due to maintenance actually we were told it was the whole of midtown without water even though the water was working elsewhere in the hoteli must say we were offered compensation for no water a voucher for their own spa at a value that meant you had to spend more unreal
so finally three hours later we got a room that was clean and didnt have wallpaper peeling off the walls no joke the second room had broken lamps and peeling paper
we stayed here for four nights paid in advance wont do that again and by the end of the stay we had tv problems bad housekeeping curtain issues blinds stopped working and met with several managers
these managers did try to compensate us for our problems however at no point did this really work the rooms were all bad that we were moved to the offer of a car to the staten island ferry one evening resulted in us being threatened with being stranded there by the driver and the complimentary meal that we had at the bear and bull i think thats the name was mediocre to say the least had i had to pay for that meal there i would have been very angry at the state of the food for the cost
this is a tired old hotel that according to two managers we spoke with hasnt really got any perfect rooms as they all need a little something no joke we even met with the building maintenance manger
please visit this hotel see the ballrooms see the lobby this is great but dont stay here no free wifi no coffee or tea makers in the rooms and massive prices for a really run down hotel coffee from room service was 8 plus a 525 per person charge plus a 15 gratuity plus state tax a 15 dollar coffee is acceptable on a desert island 20 room boutique hotel but from a run down motel it is not 
this hotel is mutton dressing as lamb i am a hilton gold member and can not recommend this hotel even though i love the brand this should be their flagship hotel and in fact i have to say it was the worst hilton we stayed in
i can only hope others do not make the same mistake as us it was a real shame to have our travels finish with what should have been a glamourous great experience at one of the worlds most famous hotels and instead it just never came out that way",1.0
large rooms comfortable hotel great staff,my family was traveling for a graduation and decided to stay at the kimberly because of the location i was surprised when i walked into the room because the suite we had was much bigger than any nyc hotel room ive stayed in we had a bedroom with 2 beds a living room with a pullout couch a kitchenette and a bathroom not to mention a small balcony and multiple closets the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were clean and quiet i love that they use neutrogena products in the hotel the staff was super friendly and provided multiple recommendations for restaurants over the 3 days we were there the rooftop bar is adorable with great views of the city will definitely come back here,4.0
cold at night,"i stayed in this hotel several times over the past 15 years the last time was around 8 years ago this time i stayed there 3 nights the location is decent especially for union square chinatown and north beach sightseeing but other than dim sum theres really no place that im aware of at least to get a reasonably priced quick hot breakfast nearby anymore since the mcdonalds that was 2 blocks away closed
be aware that the lowest priced rooms for one person are very small which doesnt really bother me since i spend little time in the room  the large bathroom and the actual hotel room are almost the same size the hotel is decent overall and the room i had was clean i dont recall ever having a problem with the rooms not being clean at this hotel
the rooms get very cold at night i had what was the end of a cold when i arrived on a saturday night and when i called the front desk after waking up freezing and coughing to ask about the heat i was just offered an extra blanket instead of a space heater like i should have been offered and was told the heat would come on in around 2 hours it never did i then spent another night with no heat and the day before i left i asked someone else at the front desk about the heat and was told that the heat was not on at all in october and i could get a space heater instead
i finally got the space heater on the 3rd night the night before i went home after freezing for 2 nights i told the front desk about this when i left and just got a sorry about that for a response i was then told again by the man at the front desk that they had central heat in the hotel and it should have been working after being told the day before that there was no heat at all in the hotel in october they should get their story straight and also train the staff to respond to problems like this in a more acceptable manner
also definitely bring earplugs if you get a room facing the inner courtyard of the building because you never know how much noise there will be loud talking tv noise etc
after this last experience i doubt ill ever stay there again despite the cheap rates",2.0
good base for fun in nyc,cool and funky contemporary decor modern rooms well located around the corner from central park and close to the subway hudson is a good base for a trip to the big apple rooms were on the small but adequate side altho my colleague complained and was moved to a bigger quieter room without any fuss also the hudson bar doubles as one of manhattens popular evening hangouts and you can walk straight past the folks queing up to get in id go back again,4.0

great location great hotel,"when booking this we had mixed ideas as to what to expect on our arrival but we were pleasantly suprised
the check in desk staff were very helpful and friendly and offered us many maps of the area and also some good places for breakfast and dinnermaxis cafe for breakfast was one of their best recommendations 
the rooms were very spacious had a good sized double bed tv good sized bathroom and a good sized wardrobe area with an iron and ironing boardi hate calling to reception and waiting hours for them to bring irons so this was a bonus
there is a also a nice bar area which from memory is on the 1st or 2nd floor
the hotel was in a good location not too far from bart stations and union square 
overall we were very pleased we booked this hotel and would stay here again",4.0
hotel with character,we stayed in this hotel for a couple of days for sightseeing and it was a great location the hotel has plenty of character and history the lobby is gorgeous the rooms are a bit small and my bathroom was very small but i guess this is the price you pay for a hotel with plenty of character in a great location,4.0
excellent hotel and great service,this was my first trip to houston and i can say that i was treated first class by the staff at the hilton garden inn the hotel itself is in a good location and has all the facilities you require for a business or pleasure trip to houston the staff in the hotel were exceptional the shuttle service provided free of charge by the hotel was also a major plus point i will be returning to this hotel on my next visit to houston,4.0
fabulous hotel,"we stayed at the sofitel for a quick anniversary getaway in manhattan  i picked it based on its excellent reviews on this site and couldnt have been more pleased the service was amazing  we checked in early got upgraded to a suite when they didnt have a room on the upper floors which i had reserved online and received a complimentary bottle of champagne with a handwritten note congratulating us on our anniversary i recommend mentioning this in the comments section when making the reservation 
the bed was very comfortable with luxurious linens very similar to the westin heavenly bed and the bathroom was beautiful as well the suite was spacious we did see the standard sized room as well and it was reasonably sized the room was well soundproofed
i had looked at many of the other luxury hotels in manhattan  i cant imagine how they could have been any nicer than the sofitel which was priced more reasonably i would definitely stay there again and would consider staying at its other resort locations in the future",5.0
very good choice,stayed here for family trip hotel is close to rockfeller center times square maybe 10 minute walk st patricks cathedral and central park very good location from which to explore the sights of the city rooms were very clean and functional stayed around 11th floor so some street noice but not bad is nyc after all hotel suited us perfectly and would stay again anytime great stay no complaints at all,4.0
very reasonable,"firstlylet me say while this motel is definitely not a luxury hotel but you pretty much get what you pay forthe price was very reasonable since i had done a lot of research before booking this one had the best price for the location which is really greatit really is 10 mins from walk of fame and universal studios tickets are given at a discount price for 2 days cheaper than 1 day at the studios 
the front desk staff was actually very polite and competent and helped us with directions and booking shuttles for disneyland as wellwe had no problems with the service in fact since i had read previous reviews regarding bad customer service i has happily surprisedmaybe they did change their staff
the pool was not heated but the spa was great and our kids made ample use of that toothe coffe shop was ok nothing to rave about but since so many restaurants are so close by it didnt matter but we had breakfast everyday which was alrightit seemed like they were renovating the coffeeshop as we saw new carpets and wallpapers done during out stay 
the staff informed us on check in that all rooms do have wireless internet so that was a welcome addition as when we had called prior to booking they had told us they only had internet connection in the lobby
the rooms were good sized and had microwave and mini fridges also with coffeemakers and hairdryers which was a definite plus for a family of 5the room was nothing fancy but very clean which is the only thing my girls were concerned withno bed bugsthe housekeeping staff was very prompt with requests for more towels and extra amenities 
the only problem was parking issues which was a challenge every single evening esp with a big suv but indeed it was free so cant complain too muchalso the open walkways were little intimidating what with young girls and family but turned out not to be any issue after all thankfully
i must say this is the most positive review on this site and im thankful that we didnt change our plans due to bad feedback as we really did get value for moneyour only suggestion would be to have a shuttle for local areas and if possible free continental breakfast which is important for budget travellers and pretty standard for all best westerns
in short stick with national chains if you want to be sure of the standards you will get",4.0

this hotel flatters to decieve,we stayed in the empire hotel on the 29th and 30 th of august for the final two nights of our honeymoonhaving stayed in new york many times before we were well aware that hotel rooms are tight but the rooms in the empire are like a coffin with you tripping over each other if you dare move with getting ready to go out requiring military planningin sufficient air conditioning in the room leaving you waking from your sleep with sweat dripping off you and gasping for airif you think the room is small then wait till you experience the bathroom it resembles a cubicle in a pubour room 1010 was located beside the elevator and the constant singing of the elevator would drive you mad room service knocking on doors from 800am this hotel was a totally disappointing experience and flatters to deceive ,2.0

hotel nice but amex cc was compromised here,"this was our 2nd stay at this hotel within the past year the room was nicely appointed bed was comfortable and ac worked reasonably well we still did not like the fact that the only covers for the bed included a regular sheet and a heavy downfilled comforter the comforter was nice but in texas in the summer when its hotter than you know what it would be nice to have a lightweight blanket to use or just the thin sheet the blankets are so heavy you absolutely burn up under them even with the ac cranked up on high i complained about this on our last stay but nothing has changed 
i can say that the entire hotel is extremely clean and smells great everyone you see on staff is extremely friendly they hold the doors open for you greet you upon arrival and departure so its a very nice touch the lobby is elegantly decorated and this trip the elevator seems to have been adjusted because it was not so unusually slow
the only negative thing i have to contribute is to beware of using your credit card the only place we used our amex card was at the front desk for incidentals which we had none and anticipated none and at the lobby coffee shop for morning coffee almost immediately after we got home a fraudulent order was placed at walmartcom with my amexcard there is no other place the card was out of my hand so there is no other explanation for where it got compromised than at this hotel i called the manager and he said they have little to no turnover  yet the person who checked us in was a newbie in training he said he would investigate but until i get the additional info from walmart as to where the ip address is that the order was placed and the ship to address i cant prove anything once i get that hopefully law enforcement will do something although i doubt it its almost an acceptable crime these days its still not acceptable for me next trip well probably stay elsewhere and i will no longer provide my amerexp card for incidentals on my other c cards ive scratched off the 3 did cic code for just such security",2.0

no problems with the edison,"a friend and i stayed at the edison for seven great nights in march 2007
yes the room and bathroom were rather small but they were clean and well serviced every day
the location of the hotel simply cannot be beaten minutes from times square restaurant row and all the great shopping of midtown
cafe edison downstairs is a great place for breakfast at very reasonable prices
this hotel has a lot of charm but could do with some updating
this was my second time in new york and my first time at the edison i will definitely stay there again",3.0
nyc kept secret  this was fantastic,"we arrived at the hotel after a long flight and many delays due to weather and were greeted with a warm friendly face we got up to the room and realised that we had the wrong suitecase  we rang down and matt at the front desk was nothing but helpful
this was the start to a fantastic stay at the distrikt hotel nyc great location next to the port authority bus depot and right near the metro line which runs trains ace  you can walk almost anywhere from this location
roomservice was discreet and left the room in clean and neat the bar  cafe downstairs  such friendly service and great food  it was like eatting at home as we missed our aussie home cooked food this was terrific
only negative about the hotel is that we ordered roomservice on our first night and last day for breaky and both times the meals came up luke warm this could be improved
overall the entire team go out of their way to make a great stay and are very helpful",5.0
greatly improved,"i visited the hilton a little over a year ago and vowed never to return however since its one of the if not the major convention spaces in town i found myself booking another trip there for the weekend of july 16th this time though the hilton was greatly improved
last time i reviewed i was unhappy with the cleanliness of my room the temperature control it never got below 78 degrees or so in our room and the location
this time i already had an idea of what to expect i prefer to be a little further north so walking is easier to get to a lot of the things i like to do in chicago but this time i knew what to expect just remember that while the map doesnt seem to show it its a bit of a hike to get up to the river and beyond that but hey its good exercise and to be fair a lot of buses do run up that way theres the train too which is a few blocks walk to get to i wouldnt say getting public transportation from the hilton is a cinch but you dont have to go too far out of your way to find a bus or train
the temperature of the hotel in general including conferences spaces is still a problem in the warm months its extremely humid and sticky and never really refreshing and cold however our room had an updated digital thermostat didnt have that last time and i was able to keep it around 72 degrees which was fine i dont know if theyre working on overhauling the cooling system for the entire hotel or if just the rooms got redone but i will say that the public spaces in the hotel were pretty uncomfortable
the room was spotless and wellappointed we had superb service the entire time from every employee we encountered and enjoyed our visit overall i cant bump my review to 5 stars but maybe next time",4.0
the absolute worst,"in terms of the cleanliness smokiness  shifty characters hanging around and remote location from the airport this is all true and it does not surprise me that folks have had credit card issues with this hotel here is our experience
we checked in for a 3 day stay we ended up checking out a day early because this hotel apparently uses their facility as a park and ride we came back at 10 am on a sunday from breakfast and there was absoutely no parking spots in the lot or underground we checked out at that point
30 days later we are checking our credit card statement and there was a 353 extra charge from the hotel  we called and were informed that we stole computer equipment from our room we were dumbfounded they said they had proof the manager told my wife nobody was in the room for 4 days and then the computer equipment a wireless router he said was discovered missing when the next people checked in and he said that we stole the router and he charged our credit card can you spell fuming mad at this point
we called the tukwila police dept and no police report was filed about any theft we contacted our credit card company and they put the courtesy credit on until situation was resolved we called ramada corporate and filed a complaint we called our relocation company i was being transfered to seattle for my job we called american express who made the reservation for us we called my employer where i have worked for 30 years 
a week later my wife got a call from the manager with a tepid apology saying in fact it was the people who stayed the night after us who stole the wireless router of course he forgot that originally he told us that nobody stayed in the room for 4 days and then they discovered it he said our credit card was being credited and the next day the credit showed up my wife coldly told him that he called us thieves and he should be ashamed of his conduct 
in 30 years of corporate and leisure travel we have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel i think the guy thought we were out of towners and perhaps we would not review our credit card statement i did not read any of the comments prior to mine until after this expereince was concluded my employer says that they will make sure that no other of the 30000 employees of my company ever will stay at this hotel btw we have yet to hear back anything from ramada corporate shameful",1.0

quiet and very relaxing,even though we were in such close proximity to the airport and our room faced the airport i never heard any planes while in the room the best way to describe this stay was functional the room was fine except for the fruit flies that were present when we got there and remained for our entire 3night stay they werent harmful just annoying desk staff was lukewarm but ok the did make it clear to us that they knew we booked through a vendor and not through them not sure what was up with that housekeeping was ok but probably the reason the fruit flies existed we had each brought a glass of wine back to the room to enjoy when finished we rinsed them and left them to be collected the next day housekeeping did not remove them the next night the same thing and again they were not removed by the time we checked out we had quite a set of glasses on the settee ive not experienced that before we didnt complain and actually found it a source of humor paying 17 per night to park was frustrating especially when we had to pay up front and the gate was open half the time to any and all who wanted to park there for free allinall id go back but only if the price was right there are a lot of hotels to choose from in the area so i wouldnt go out of my way to find it again,3.0
ok its not the best hotel in dc but,"we booked a long weekend for leisure i was concerned over the poor reviews harrington had on tripadvisor my husband had stayed there over 10 years ago and said it was nice so i figured if he liked it it couldnt be too bad 
we chose this hotel because we came to dc via union station and could take the metro to within one block we were only steps away from the mall and could walk just about everywhere and we did
we arrived at 1030 am and our room was ready so we checked in we were in the new wing built between 1917  1918 we booked a standard king our room was small but clean and comfortable a small tv microwave refrigerator and hot pot were in a corner of the room the bathroom had clearly been renovated but had some cracks in the tile and water damage by the window back in 1918 there werent any showers so they had to put the shower head in an odd place when renovating 
the staff was very helpful and very very nice there was harrys restaurant and harrietts restaurant we had breakfast in harrietts 1200 buffet includes juice and coffeee and it was good we ate a harrys and the sandwiches and hamburgers are huge and tasty
why did i rate the harrington as poor overall but gave each category a better rating because for the price we paid in any other city i would have expected a 3 or 4 star hotel this is dc and you pay for location even in a lesser hotel you are close to everything a tourist would want to see iefords theatre was a block or two away keep an open mind and enjoy the age the hotel has to offer but if you are very particular choose another venue",2.0
staff is very accomodating,this is a very nice hotel do not hesitate to stay here it is a little distance from beale street and graceland about 20  25 minutes but well worth it the hotel is set back from the street and is located close to germantown there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and the highway tn355 is very close there is a free breakfast and the staff is wonderful miss betty will take care of any of your needs,5.0
loved it great hotel,"just back from 3 nights at affinia chicago 15th nov  18th nov 07
what a great hotel didnt think our room would be anything like we got  i actually thought we were upgraded but i was told that was just a standard room  we had a bedroom  a sitting room which were both very spacious had a sofa bed also  a lovely bathroom of a nice size i really cant complain about anythin in the room
i read before i travelled that the hotel was under construction but it never bothered me one bit  i dont even think i seen a construction worker on my stay
they dont have a bar or restaurant at the hotel at the moment but they offer complimentry water and snacks at reception and theres also menus in the hotel rooms from alot of restaurants in the area that deliver food direct to ur door so that came in handy for us
the location of the hotel is great too a couple of steps to all the shops
the staff at the hotel cant do enough for u either there so helpful  the bell hops are so friendly 
overall i had a fab stay at affinia and would definetly recommend it to anyone
chicago is great

small rooms well located,i had high hopes for a fairly deluxe experience as my work travel service managed to source a room for us530 per night unfortunately that turned out to be misguided as the smallish room turned out to be the usual bland american chain fare with a very low ceiling which may have been comforting for a hobbit it made me feel slightly claustrophobic ditto the bathroom on the plus side the staff were friendly and happy to help and the downtown location is great some other guests told me they were paying us200 per night on an internet deal which i think is about right,3.0
city of blinding lights,the new yorker hotel is in a great location just opposite madison square gardens and a small stroll away from macys and the empire state building there are 3 subways near by a 10 minute walk from times square it was our anniversary and the hotel kindly put us in a room with a view of the empire state fantastic the room was clean and the lobby looked great with its marble bell hops and art decco security was tight which was reassuring although i never felt threatened once in the city we used the tick tock diner once which was a little disappointing compared to others we ate at although it was always full and busy the bar was ok but very expensive 9 dollars for a glass of wine the hotel met my expectations and i would use again i was a little miffed by the long queues to check in and the reception staff looked a little fed up and were short tempered at times however elsewhere the staff were helpful especially the cleaners who we tipped everyday,4.0
good hotel near china town,"i stayed here while attending some ceremonies in dc in may the hotel is very nice and the best that i have stayed in while in washington dc i have stayed at the hilton garden inn and another marriott property in the past the rooms were clean and large the bathroom was a little tight but oh well
i really liked the location very near china town basically in china town the metro is very close by and very walkable i agree with other reviews that the hotel has some of the best beds i have ever slept on i even called the housekeeping staff to find out the brand apparently the brand is only sold to hotels and not available for purchase by private citizens at least under the same model number 
i didnt eat here there was a starbucks in the hotel and a nice bar try the district chophouse nearby they have great steaks and its a microbrewery with good beer for late night chinese check out big wongs its in the basement and a little seedy but had the best general tsos chicken ive ever had

swankier than the nearby hyatt century plaza,"after a disappointing experience at the intercontinental hotel in san francisco not the mark hopkins  the newer one it was a relief to experience a much higher level of hospitality at this hotel service is very warm and solicitous i was never made to feel like i was a burden when making any request and in general everyone seemed to be at the top of their game
the rooms are very large and the one i was given had a huge balcony including 2 lounge chairs and two regular chairs with a 270degree view of the los angeles skyline as well as two flatpanel tvs the bathroom was also large with both a shower and a tub and the vanity in a separate room in general this hotel feels a lot more exclusive and fancy than the nearby century plaza hyatt regency which has much more of a tourgroup and conventionconference feel to it at the same time the ic hotel is not quite as centrally located as the hyatt  it is about a 10minute walk farther from the westfield mall and most of the big office buildings except for fox plaza including the office that i frequent
the last time i stayed here 4 years ago this hotel was a park hyatt it seems that not much has been changed which is actually fine the furnishings are still holding up although i can see that a renovation may be needed in another 45 years the gym is exactly the same as it was in the park hyatt days same equipment even so far it is still working
when i need to be near the office i will stay at the hyatt but when i can afford to be a bit farther away this is where i intend to return",5.0
probably nicer choices close by,"stayed here to attend a training that was in close proximity to the hotel im not that familiar wtih austin but it was near the training center and all the comments on tripadvisor about the proximity and view of the lake were appealing 
the rooms were clean but the property could use updating the garage is attached to the lake tower but my room was in the other tower so you have to go down to the lobby from the garage and across the restaurants shops and lobby to another set of elevators also the fitness center is in the lake tower also so maybe i wouldve liked being in that tower better the lake tower also must have the lake views because my view was of the parking garage 
the folks who have mentioned the noise from i35 arent joking it is loud and constant all night now that ive seen the area i have spotted a few places that are close by that look newer and a little nicer",3.0
great weekend with my daugther however,"my daughter planned a trip for us in april 2012 the hotel helis was hip and fun we both enjoyed vipe i really has a change to see dc loved it however i am going to say lost one of my favorite rings which had a lot of meaning for me i know one of the cleaner has to take it 
because i remember  i said to my daughter oh no my ring is on the night stand let me go back and get it  she said to me ma dont worry they dont steal her  well what do you know we can back for our day in dc and the dang ring was gone  a lessoned learned for me  but i still miss that dang ring ",3.0
what a disappointment,i have been wanting to stay here for the last 10 years and what a let down we are relocating to columbus and my company put me up here so i didnt even pay for it and complained for their money first my so and i are both tall i am 59 and he is 62 why they put us in an ada room with a short shower is beyond me then the shower was dirty complete with someones sliver of soap the sheets are not high quality as you would expect in this hotel parking is a nightmare for guests you either pay the 10 for valet or be prepared to hoof it to one of of the mall garages with your stuff the internet is 10 a day upon check in you are asked to sign an agreement saying you will pay 100 fee if you cuy your stay short  ive traveled all over the world and have never encountered this they clearly know this hotel is not worth the price ive stayed on the other end of the strip at the courtyard and would go back there in a second the atmosphere is pretty though when i complained to the from desk gal regarding all these issues all i got was a bunch of blinking eyes and continued im sorry hardly makes up for 400 of wasted money,2.0
location made up for the downsides ,late update as im catching up  stayed there in june and nov of 2008 wanted to go to the helmsley palace on the second journey but couldnt get in the reviews are all pretty accurate i was there on a business trip and took along my partner too for a short break in june i came alone on bizz in nov as another person said i have stayed in numerous leading hotels of the world in but this hotel falls behind in overall quality not so much the servicebut in general the old girl is just looking and feeling a bit tired  the room we had was an ordinary roomit did the jobbut thats about it there was nothing wrong with it well decoration was pretty old and dire  but then again there was nothing to shout from the hill tops about  the dining room on the 2nd floor is one of the most pleasant of places to have breakfast for sure as most of the people have said location for guests is the one thing that saves this hotel for visitors to the big apple its the best place to start from my partner loved it she was a stones throw from 5th avecentral park right in front  my office 3 blocks awayso everything for her was within easy distance for a personal break i would go to another hoteljust to be able to have a few more modconsbut as i invariably go there on business and im tied to a handful of hotels and the helmsley group will get my custom again,3.0
my new favorite for family trips to nyc,"this is a nice quiet upper east side place with large rooms that is only a few blocks walk to the museum of natural history across the street is a great fairway market grocery store with excellent prepared foods and desserts better than whole foods says my spouse it was a business trip for me and the family came along for the ride to enjoy the city beacon worked out perfectly theres a starbucks right next to the hotel the red line 1 2 metro is a few block south and there are tons of restaurants nearby surprisingly we took a cab from the hotel to a yankee game on a thursday night and it was clear sailing hardly any traffic on the way there
the hotel is right next to the beacon theatre which hosts smaller shows steely dan in september there didnt appear to be anything going on the 4 nights we were there so if shows at the theatre become an inconvenience to hotel guests my guess is not",5.0
service service service wowand amazing boutique hotel,total value and modern hotelgreat great servicea must if in san diego,5.0
good value and location,"the midtown is a fairly basic spartan hotel but ultimately it is good value for money for the price paid compared to what others are charging you get a clean reasonably sized room and best of all you are in a great location close to the heart of boston so value for money is very good
as mentioned the hotel itself is pretty spartan with limited amenities i found the service to be ok although not outstanding and the room i was in was fine  reasonably spacious and clean with everything i needed not outstanding but not terrible either 
the best part of the hotel is where it is located close to the subway close to the city and close to most of the major attractions you wont be disappointed with this aspect of things",3.0
perfect location friendly staff historic and worth the money,despite several dodgy reviews on trip advisor our experience was amazing yes the systems went down at check in meaning we had to wait a while but the staff went out of their way to help and in the end we scored the best room in the hotel so no wonder were happy our room had recently been renovated and was on the 10th floor not quite what i expected as parquet floors chrome fridge modern kitchen and bathroom flat screen tv the stairwells are full of amazing art cool characters hanging around in every corner if you are looking for bell boys room service gym etcthis is not the place for you however if you want history cool characters space compared to the other hotel wed been in this is like a palace and charmhighly recommend staying here cant believe expedia have down graded it to a two star not in our experience dont go to the ribs place a couple of doors down though got a slight touch of food poisoning great little gay bar a few doors up on the left friendly to those who are not gay as well,4.0
great boutique hotel in the perfect location,if you are looking for a unique place to stay in sf this is definitely the place to go my fiance and i stayed here for the weekend to celebrate his birthday and we couldnt have asked for more special attention i contacted the hotel manager wes a few weeks before to arrange a few surprises for my fiance they took care of every detail which helped to make it his best birthday ever the location of the hotel is great too you are right in the middle of everything parking was easy and we were right next to the cable car stop forget about staying at nearby chain hotels the chancellor is definitely the way to go thanks again wes,5.0
long on pretention short on customer service,"my husband i and i spent last weekend at the w hotel we are what made the trip awesome not the w hotel my impression of the hotel is that they have tried to create this phony expensive world for the cool kids and if your not one of the cool kids forget about getting service let alone a good morning from staff except for the man cleaning the rooms the morning we left there were two men i think they were suppose to be doormen that openly spent the 45 minutes that we waited for our shuttle leering and gesturing at women walking by neither one of them attempted to make any contact nor offer help to my husband nor myself they reminded me of something out of american gigolo i found them both disrespectful and objectifying towards women they made my skin crawl
the room was starting to look shabby if you like to feel like your in a cave youd like the room we called the front desk for two items never received them and the clerk was rude i think i was bothering her the bed was awful my husband had a sore back the three days we were in nyc the music that is played all day creates this sleazy atmosphere the hallways are very dark and i didnt feel comfortable walking by myself i felt bad for my husband because he went through a lot of trouble and money to book the trip the hotel again did not add to our experience shame on the w for trying to create false impressions install some lights get rid of the techno music and train your staff to understand that they should be trying to please the customer not the other way around differently not family nor couple friendly maybe a good place to come if your a swinging single and want to score some action",2.0
great value hotel we will be back,"arrived late on friday to find our double standard room to be right opposite the bar on the first floor asked the guy on the front desk for a different room due to the noise from the bar and he explained that the only avaliable room at that time was in the smoking side of the hotel reluctantly we agreed to stay in it but found it to be clean and fresh apart from the corridor outside he said that tomorrow saturday some guests were leaving and that he would move us to a non smoking room with a free king size upgrade
the next day we went out early and upon our return found we had a front of hotel first floor king size bedded room and that our luggage had been transfered to the room too
excellent service
complimentary breakfast was great too cereal bagels fruit yoghurt cream cheese toast pastries and doughnuts in abundance with fresh coffee and juice
will definetly return the next time we visit nyc",4.0
extremely relaxing and beautiful room,"this place is a steal for 90 its walking distance or a quick drive to some trendy bars and about a 10 minute drive from the arts district in noda for some restaurants and live music at night the rooms are gorgeously decorated and extremely clean i stayed in a studio with my sister and it had a double bed pullout couch recliner desk dining table refrigerator kitchen and stove vanity and of course a toilet and bath and a flatscreen television and highspeed internet access a cord not wireless
one of the light bulbs went out and within a couple minutes of calling the front desk someone came by to replace the light the complimentary breakfast is pretty awesome with everything from your typical collection of cereals bagels and donuts to a waffle station scrambled eggs hash browns sausage coffee tea juice muffins yogurt parfait you name it they also have a full bar available for evening socialization the staff is also pretty friendly
we only stayed here for a night but it was definitely worth it",5.0
very good option in manhattan,"my wife and i stayed for 4 nights in this hotel and we were very satisfied with our hosting its not a hotel for those seeking luxury or design but brings other advantages efficient service huge rooms clean and well kept with comfortable and large beds  discreet decoration in traditional courtyard by marriotts style bathrooms clean and well equipped 
it has a small lobby with few employees but all efficient and attentive good location 3rd ave for those who like to stay in midtown east near major attractions with good restaurants around

wonderful service wonderful hotel,"we stayed at the grand del mar over labor day weekend we were extremely impressed with the quality of service even during what was presumably one of the busiest weekends of the year
we stayed at the hotel with our 5 month old baby we requested a crib for the room when we made our reservations the hotel contacted us before our stay and asked us the name of our baby when we arrived in our room the hotel had spelled out our babys name in colorful sponges around the bathtub the hotel also gave us a gift for the baby upon our arrival we were blown away by the attention to detail
the food at the resort is better than most other hotel food and there are plenty of options we also thought the food was reasonably priced especially compared to other hotels of this class 
the pool area was very crowded but the staff still managed to help us quickly 
the hotel is a little isolated so a car is a necessity but the isolation also makes for scenic views of the golf course and the mountains the hotel is in a beautiful setting  much nicer than the four seasons
the staff consistently impressed us everyone seemed genuinely happy to help us the concierge and bell man remembered our name after our first meeting 
we are usually very picky travelers but the grand del mar exceeded our expectations in every way",5.0
stunning views lovely staff,i had booked this hotel as part of a surprise trip for my other half because of the central location and the stunning views afforded by the huge windows in the rooms i mailed the front desk a couple months before our arrival explaining what i was up to and asked if we could be placed on a high floor they promptly replied and were very helpful id booked a superior queen which only covers floors 417 so they were true to their word and we were shown to a room on the 14th floor when we arrived the views are just stunning the room was very clean and as described enjoying a shower in the wet room whilst still being able to admire the view is brilliant there were lots of towels nice clean robes and the bed was very comfortable indeed the only issue was being right by the lifts room 18 meant it was a little noisy and on the one night they had a function up on the 17th floor the music travelled down the lift shafts and i had to go for my ear plugs the location of the hotel is excellent for the subway and walking north along the highline is a pleasure the bar on the 17th floor while expensive is fantastic the german beer place underneath left a little to be desired overall though a fantastic place to stay,4.0
great location in theater district,clean convenient location in times square and theater district easy walk to theater restaurants and metro much betterfaster than taking a cab noisy even though we were on the 7th flconstant noise from traffic and sirens a block from a grocery store for fast meals exceptionally helpful concierge larry gave us good suggestions for dinner shows and attractions,4.0
nice place to stay but,the hotel was very clean and well maintained the staff was very professional and helpful however the bed was one of the most uncomfortable i have ever slept in i slept in hideabeds which were more comfortable the idea it is adjustable is miss leading yes it adjusts but only leaves a hole in the bed where u were sleeping the top is so firm there is no element of comfort if you have a bad back and enjoy firm mattress these are the beds for you,3.0
not as great as the last,i stayed here again for work and was surprised by my room the last time i stayed here i must have gotten a newly renovated room because it was fantastic this time it was just your average hotel room and small bathroom the service and location still make this hotel worth it the other issue is for some reason i have to follow up with this omni to get credit for stays ive only come across this issue at this particular omni,4.0
best location but not for everyone,for the price and location this is one of the best deals in the san francisco i paid 9800 bucks a night for a thursday and friday now when i say location please keep in mind it is steps from union square great but also steps from the tenderloin not so great now being so close to the tenderloin doesnt bother me but it is not for everyone so please keep that in mind if you want a nice clean basic room in walking distance then yes if you want luxury and spa and massage experience then skip the metropolis and go pay ,4.0

great place for business meeting,i was only in dallas for less then 40 hours but thought the hyatt dfw was great the meeting rooms were conveniently located and well appointed all of the meals were well prepared and very tasty the banquet meal was especially good and i appreciated being served by well dressed polite and professional staff  these genterlmen were very attentive and went out of their way to provide a great dining experience the hotel lobby and guest rooms were contemporary but comfortable and very well appointed if i had to pick one item that the hyatt excelled at it would probably be the prompt  friendly and professional service that they provided from check in to wait staff and bar service i hate it when sloppy service ruins the experience but i rreally appreciate it when the service puts the hotel or resturant over the top well done hyatt dfw staff and management,4.0
lovely location nice hotel,"this hotel really does have a boudoir feel to it and is in a great position so was happy with our stay there the room was a nice enough size and was stylishly designed and the bed was 5 star quality for comfort
on the negative side i think if i was to go to new york again i probably wouldnt stay here as i would have liked more facilties such as a swimming pool and a much better breakfast area than simply cereal fruit and bagels
if your not that bothered about being lavished with spas then ignore me and go here its a great base hotel for getting out and experiencing new york",4.0

very nice place with good service decent location,we had a pleasant stay here for the 4th of july weekend the hotel has a beautiful lobby and is clean and well apppointed not brand new but nice the rooms were large enough to be comfortable and the service was good the concierges were not particularly helpful with restaurant choices im being kind they were pretty much useless but they tried we did not love the location but it is pretty close to georgetown and dc is small enough to walk almost everywhere anyway my wife had a poor experience booking spa treatments,4.0

you only get what you pay for,"my daughter aged 10 and myself stayed for 4 nights at the jolly hotel madison towers in november 2007
i read a few reviews before booking and decided i should book a deluxe room an extra 125 for a total of 4 nights  well i tried very hard to find fault with this hotel  and sorry i couldnt
i took advice from previous reviews and avoided breakfast  so no problems there our room was wonderful  15th floor with a view of the empire state building looked exactly like the photos on the website tea  coffee in the room beautiful bathroom together with toiletries lots of room for luggage and shopping requested a nonsmoking room  so no smells of cigarettes
reception was very helpful  but then we had no complaints and doormanporters were very pleasant and cheerful free umbrellas free local phone call from reception
my daughter and i travel abroad at least 3 times a year for holidays and i travel abroad on business fairly regularly our overall experience was very good with this hotel it certainly met up to our expectations
ideally situated in walking distance of everywhere in central manhattan only disappointment from our trip was that most of the shows on broadway were cancelled due to strike action from stage hands but this is nothing to do with the hotel
would certainly go back to this hotel",4.0
beautiful decor great location and,"the palomar is a lovely hotel in a great location in philadelphia the suite i stayed in was a good size and very comfortable
reception was friendly and check in check out was an easy affair every single member of staff in the hotel that i passed said hello except for one surly fellow who really should not be working in hospitality
i was disappointed to find that the sofa in my room had been turned into a bed whilst i was out of the room this was due to an operational error and was quickly rectified by a friendly smiling apologetic house service person 
the road right in front of the hotel was a mess during my stay which made stopping for the valet parking a precarious affair i was disappointed that when i got my car back it was covered in pollen no attempt had been made to clear it from the windows",4.0
greatly and pleasantly surprised,"its a big hotel the great staff make it feel more intimate than it is when was the last time you were having breakfast paid your check and your server asked if you wanted a coffee to go huge bar area which is great for a drink when having a meeting with colleagues there is a big rooms renovation going on  not to worry it is not a distraction i was in an room that had not yet been redone and i was very happy with the room size amenities etc only minor snit  tv did not get sufficient channels and some of my reception was poor

location location locationnot to mention brand new,"my wife and i just got back from 3 nights at the hgi tribeca and we thought it was fantastic keep in mind its not an oppulent over the top hotel this is basic stay place done right the lobby is small there isnt alot of glitz and glam but then again for the price you cant beat the location
the location as been said is between 6th ave and 7th ave just below canal st we were originally worried about the holland tunnel traffic but it wasnt that bad until saturday const in the tunnel most other days it was typical nyc the location is so close to the soho shoppingrestaurants and not to mention the trendy scene in tribeca if your not familar with the area its not like midtowntimes square at all there arent throngs of people there arent big bus tours its just geniune nyc we were able to walk to the wtc site the brooklyn bridge and greenwich village all within 15 mins
as far as taking a cab to the hotel that can be tricky dont say its on york st york st is a one block long alley and noone will know wher that is instead say its on 6th ave between walker and canal in tribeca as you come up 6th ave its on the left one block before canal look for the red restaurant awnings that say bar artisenal
as for the hotel when we checked in we were informed that no king size beds were available they instead offerred us a room with a jacuzzi tub now that was an unexpected surprise and came in handy at the end of long days hiking around the city the tub was huge allowing two people to fit very comforatbly the double bed rooms had full size beds not queen which was a bit cozy but the room itself had plenty of space the beds were comfortable and they were the airadjustable variety so you could adjust the firmness it was very clean throughout there was a mini fridge and microwave as well as a coffee maker in the room they have full comcast digitialhd cable tv including hbo and hbo on demand nice for a chain hotel
there is no pool so dont be misled by the website there also arent safes in the room there are plenty of cabs going uptown on 6th ave and youll never have a problem getting one there is a dunkin donuts across the street when you need a ddfix in the morning",5.0
nice hotel nice location,"we spent xmas and new year in this hotel we liked the room very much it was clean and comfortable nice smell and it is very important for me as i am a non smoker the heather was working fine and it has the most comfortable beds i had ever been  the hotel is in a nice location next to the subway and it is a quiet place at night so you can sleep
i disliked the dirty windows and it is a real pity because of the nice view you have from the room
we had another problem with the bill they charged meals in their restaurants we never had  i wish i would jajajaja instead of a pizza outside the hotel
about the renewing works outside we didnt suffer them because most of the workable time we were out the hotel visiting places
the bathroom was clean and hot water all day long and the courtesy shampoo conditioner cream etc were enough and of a very good quality one nice thing you will find for every woman is the hair dryer it is a real one to dry hair and not to feel a simple breeze
the free coffee and tea at the room was a nice touch we enjoyed it very much specially on winter
this is a hotel i would go back",2.0
the ultimate in service beauty and compassion,we selected hotel palomar after a lengthy search for a honeymoon spot that would not only allow our dogs to be with us but that would honor them as guests palomar exceeded even our highest expectations our beloveds were permitted to be with us even in certain common areas as we enjoyed the fabulous daily complimentary wine event and we were assigned a suite in an area that was incredibly peaceful and nonscary for our little ones  every area of the hotel was adorned with truly beautiful original artwork which filled our senses without interfering with great relaxation  the kindness of the service was unmatched in our experience and cleanliness and freshness of the air and all environs were splendid  our concierge on arrival the brilliant young philip welcomed us so warmly that we felt like celebrities  this notwithstanding that all four of us my husband our 2 dogs and i are all mutts and i am a funnylooking one at that   we shall probably never enjoy such luxury and comfort again at any price  and our memories of this stay are crystals of bliss  ,5.0
location great room not so great,"we traveled to dc over columbus day weekend for a wedding we loved the location of the hotel  close to the metro starbucks eateries etc we also liked the decor of the hotel  very modern and sleek the final thing we really liked was the bed  very comfy 
however everything else about the room itself just sucked ive had a better nights sleep in a group hostel room in amsterdam than this 4star hotel 
the bathroom  this was set up to look cool but was totally dysfunctional first there was no door between the bathroom and the bedroom there was a small door between the toilet and the sink but it only provided visual privacy no sound privacy it was really uncomfortable to use the toilet i love my husband but there are just some things i dont want to hear there was no shower curtain only a super sleek looking super useless halfwall up near the shower head as a result shower water sprayed out all over the bathroom  kinda dangerous definitely annoying we called the desk and asked about a shower curtain they said they had to check and get back to us no one called we stopped by the desk and they said they might be ordering shower curtains  we asked for a bunch of extra towels to put on the floor
the room  there was no dead bolt on the door this combined with the wacky do not disturb sign see below resulted in me opening my eyes at 8 am and finding a member of the cleaning staff standing just inside our door presumably trying to figure out if she should clean our room so there were definite safety and privacy concerns this combined with the fact that the metal room door seemed to superconduct hallway noise other guests doors elevator voices i got very little sleep finally the do not disturb sign was a metal button that you pushed on the inside of the room which lit up a red electric do not disturb message next to the door in the hallway very cool concept but poorly thought out the only way you could tell if the light was on was to go outside and look i think the morning the mad came in we had neglected to go out and check if it was on all in all if location is your main priority i could recommend the hotel but otherwise i think a traveler could have a better experience elsewhere",2.0
old world upscale hotel,"here is an old world hotel with lots of charm and amenities for a price this is definitely how the wealthy enjoy a weekend or longer in nyc if you can afford it i recommend a weekend during the winter when the city is decorated and festive this hotel is classy with butlers who are available with a call day and night you pay for service and service is what you get from the moment you walk into the lobby until you leave 
the restaurant onsite is very high end but the king cole bar is affordable and an institution if you enjoy an old fashion manhattan or any of the old school cocktails these bartenders do them all justice",4.0

would definitely return,i stayed at the broadway manor inn for a week in early january and it was the best decision i made as a british female travelling on my own i was concerned about safety and cleanliness the are the broadway manor inn was located in felt really safe reasonably quiet but walking distance from just about anywhere the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the rates were great the room and bathroom were clean and spacious and there was a fridge microwave coffemaker and tv what more can one ask for especially if youre travelling on a budget i would definitely recommend it,4.0

expensive overpriced business hotel,rooms are adequate but hotel is busy and service and staff is marginal on a good day bordering on rude price is nowhere near worth it free wifi is freeif you can acquire the weak signaldont bother stayed twice last month and the second time i was upgraded to a suite right next to the elevator banks i called to complain and the gentlemen asked why i was complaining that i was upgraded i asked for a manager to call me back and am still waiting will stay here again only because this is where my company tells me to stay breakfast buffet is good but pricey concierge was better allowing us to check out umbrellas on a rainy day,3.0
if you want to be in the gaslamp area this hilton fits the criteria,"the hilton gaslamp is nice and in a good location we had one of the suites and it was a good size for san diego you know immediately that noise is going to be an issue when earplugs are on the nightstand
the hotel brings the old and new together with the more modern furnishings 
the valet unloading area makes the best of a tricky location it works it isnt as functional as some but it isnt a mess as it appears
suite 1112 also had a view of air conditioners from the living area we kept the drapes closed to reduce noise and cover up the lack of a view in that direction the other windows had an okay view",4.0
wonderful facilities and location  the staff is what makes it so great,"this is a beautiful historic hotel in a great location  quick walk to the waterfront and union square etc the rooms are very nice sized and well maintained overall the facilites are great including the gym
what sets this property apart is the staff i have stayed at many high end hotels and the warm friendly and attentive service from the staff of this hotel ranks up with the very best every single person i encountered was delightful  i stayed 3 nights and the valets doormen front desk folks and housekeeping folks all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful the concierge i believe his name was lex gave us some excellent advice as we were departing for a weekend in wine country i cant say enough about how great everyone was
while there may be more grand hotels in sf with more modern facilities i strongly believe you will not find one with better service",5.0
good stay outstanding omelette chef,repeat stay because of past good experiences and proximity to family but one major additional factor was the madetoorder omelettes available at the breakfast included with the room cost all cooked by one truly excellent extremely friendly chef go early to beat the long line but its definitely worth it gets your day off to a good start the room was fine even though showing a little wear particularly the somewhat tired matress definitely would stay here again,5.0
awesome place,"i love this hotel arrived off the virgin flight into sfo and into the cool and calm lobby which has a great feel and checked in to the first surprise they had upgraded us to a panoramic suite and then on showing us up on a beautiful day we had to stop and take in the view its awesome as was the suite itself very spacious great fixtures and fittings loads of space to play work relax  you could have a cocktail party in it
i liked the amenities particularly the bose soundock to plug the ipod into and charge it which is now just a basic requirement that so many places dont get the very well stocked mini bar and not a rip off either the bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom and shower were lovely though a little more water pressure would be cool the lobby area a little oddly shaped and not really enough wardrobe space for a long stay but this was a minor negative
we found the staff charming and attractive all our requests were efficiently and politely handled i particularly liked the explanation on checkin of the charges they would apply to my card i wish many more hotels would be that honest and up front
the views really do make it however i would strongly advise a waterfront room when the fog clears and sun comes out you get a great sense of wellbeing with karma of the place and the light
a week later i came back this time to a deluxe waterfront king no soundock but still a great room nonetheless
one thing to be aware of the bar and outside deck are extremely popular in the early evening do not bank on getting a table",5.0
front desk service was aweful,family of four arrived after midnight the front desk clerk a sour looking black lady in her late 30s or early 40s was rude to me and my wife we paid with cash and she was handed the money yet when it was time for her to give us the change she never counted it she basically just threw it at us so to speak she was very impatient as wellthe night time security guard was very nice though we went to speak to the manager the next morning and the house keepers warned us that it was no good they stated that everyone complains about the front desk clerk at night but she was untouchable erica and luis ponce,2.0
perfect central locationbetter than avg hotel,i stayed at this hotel at the end of october and would suggest it to others because of its location and value we walked everywhere from this hotel and thought it was perfect for its central location we did not eat at the restaurant but stopped in the bar a few nights which was quite nice with very good bartenders on the downside and its been mentioned in other reviews the elevators are very slow during peak times and the walls are paper thin the shower in the room next door sounds like its in your room the room size is very good and the amenities are average the bay view rooms are beautiful,4.0
so pleased with our selection,"we have had a tough year and a weekend break to ny was long awaited so to make it perfect i spend weeks looking in to hotel and studying reviews i loved the look and location of this hotel according to the hotels own website but there were one or two trip advisor reviews which left me with doubts nevertheless i decided to go ahead and book it for 4 nights
delighted is all i can say the entrance is small yes and a couple of sofas if you wanted to wait around but reception staff was helpfull friendly and so very polite the lifts were ok i dont feel we waited exceptionally long for one to arrive the corridors are clean neat and tidy we were on floor 10 in an executive room which i believe is the same as a standard room just slightly bigger 
no great view but i wasnt there to sit and look out of the window there was a desk which i used as a dressing table not a massive amount of space to put things in the bathroom but seriously we were there for 4 nights so there was enough room for what we needed just a shower no bath but that was hot and good pressure
a safe in the wardrobe and about 20 hangers for the two of us there were three drawers either side of the massive comfortable bed which again for 4 nights was perfectly adaquate for what we needed
the tv was large and had the usual channels we managed to watch a film on abc or something like that and you can pay extra for new films etc if you wanted too not too sure how much they are the mini bar is motion sensitive and that includes the things on top so i would recommend not touching any of it
the coffeetea mmmmm well not too great to be honest you have to make one cup at a time and there is only creamer and sweetners in the little packet so not too good but if black coffee if your thing then all good
you can have laundry room service wake up calls etc etc the usual staff
the only small thing was one day after the room being cleaned they left a glass of water next to the bed and didnt empty one of the bins but that was it you can have your towels and sheets changed as often as you like
location  could not do better if you come out of the hotel and turn left within about a 1 minute stroll you are in the centre of time squares all the lights etc etc are there right in front of you if you then turn left of right you are on broadway
if you turn right out of the hotel and walk two blocks you are on fifth ave this is about a 3  4 minute stroll away central park is just passed tiffanys and takes about a 1520 minute stroll empire state is about 10 15 minute stroll with a pass by macys
everthing is walking distance and if not for you the main bus terminal is 5 minute walk nearest subway is no more than 5 minutes walk
the restaurant right next to the hotel you can charge to your room we had breakfast there and it was about 45 for two of us for breakfast juice toast  coffee 
overall the best decision i have made on a hotel to give you an idea i stay in 5 star hotels generally but in a city a 4 star as you dont spend any time there we were out by 9am and not back until 12am or a quick pop i for shower and change a clean friendly and lovely hotel dont waste money on others for a fancy entrance with a man on the door as they are not worth it",5.0
good location not new,"this is my 3rd stay at this hotel and my experience is very consistant
the hotel location is good  within walking distance of the park times square and right above the subway station
breakfast is very good and there is a starbucks on the same block
gym is well equiped and good size
the rooms are relatively old but clean
overall good value and a default choice for me on business trips to the city",4.0
phil w review,this a great hotel to stay new clean very nice people and a good breakfast not much else to ask for a terrific deal too i have stayed here 4 times in the past year and have had a great experience each time and i highly recommend it,5.0
great locationvery noisy,"i chose this hotel due to the location and it being trendy the location is perfect for nyc probelm is that the downstairs barclub has loud thumping music till 3am on friday and saturday even though i was on the 10th floor could hear every word this was unacceptable
the check in desk is like a cattle ranch very chaotic the staff at the reception are hurried and very curt and give minimal info concierge also very rushed every request seems an effort and answers are brief and unhelpful
it was also annoying that in the evenings burly guards stand at the elevators rude and unfriendly they ask for id if you enter the lifts this is irritating as one feels imprisoned and it takes the freedom of the holiday away
except for the location which is excellent this hotel is noisy and has rude staff it iis not cheap so these faults are unacceptable",2.0
great stay,stayed here for a brief overnight minivacation despite not being one of the classiest places to stay in the inner harbor it was quite nice the room was big and well appointed the bathroom was very nice and accommodating the room was clean and i was only able to find a few minor things wrong with the stay the lack of a minifridge in the room was a little bit of a disappointment also the tv was hard to work and for being an high definition tv it did not receive any high definition channels the staff was very nice and personable i only stayed there one night but i would recommend this if you are looking for a simple place to hang your hat dont pass up their complimentary breakfastit is one of the best free breakfasts of any hotel i have stayed in,4.0
overall very good experience,i throughly enjoyed by stay at becks its a basic motel but my room was very comfortable and clean my room looked like it had just been renovated and was very spacious the best thing about this motel is its very close to castro street no more than two blocks to the metro bar and another block to all the other bars in the castro if its convenience you are looking without having to get a cab to the castro i would recommend becks i also took bart from sfo airport to civic center station and then connected to the muni and then its only a two block walk to the motel i would not have a problem staying here again and would recommend it to others,5.0
fantastic everything,just got back from this property and i was exceedingly happy with the experience the service was amazing across all levels room was clean and spacious the bedding package was amazing and the location is unparalleled whether in boston for business or pleasure you cant beat this hotel it is walking distance from most anything you could want to do combine a premium location with staff that genuinely seems to care and its a combo that you cant beat,4.0
lots of promise a little short on delivery,i booked the rock star suite i was expecting to be wowed based on my experience at the hard rock vegas and found the room less interesting than most normal hotel rooms the room was dark and split up into 3 areas that made it seem cramped the small living room is loaded with so much in room selling that it looked like a convenience store the food is decent and big the internet was rather slow closets are tiny the gym is good for a hotel a very high style lobby,3.0
huge by new york standards,"i booked this trip using hotwire which gave it a 45 star boutique hotel 
i was treated wonderfully by the hotel clerk when i happen to ask for a room with a king bed 
normally hotwired rooms are always queen size beds
to my delight when we opened the door we were amazed to find a two room suite that even included a small kitchen
the living room was huge but mostly the king bed was luxurious
the location was one short block from the subway and the midtown location at lexington and 50th was spoton
the next morning i called and asked for a late check out and they extended our visit for 2 hours",4.0
one of the best sleeps ever,i stayed at the hotel from august 25th to the 29th other than navigating the way from the bart 495 per person as opposed to 16 per person for the shuttle and approx 40 for the taxi to the hotel the w is easy to find the closest bart station is montgomery which is about two blocks from the w the hotel itself is very chic the lobby during the day doubles as a dj lounge at night we didnt mind the music whatsoever the front desk staff were very friendly and were able to meet my request of an early checkin the room was small but quiet comfortable and meticulously clean we practically melted into the beds making that alone worth the stay shops are not too far away though a walk to union square will be about six blocks the views from the room were spectacular and it was relaxing to spend evenings sitting on the alcove reading a book and looking at the san francisco skyline i would definitely make another stay at the w san francisco when i visit again,5.0
the carter is unique crazy and not the best in the world but still good fun,"ive stayed here every summer for the last 5 years and this year i was there for 4 nights in august and 1 in september i use it as transit hotel for next stop 
first off the bad bits the hotel is pretty old and although renovations are going on with 700 rooms and the fact its usually very busy dont expect a fancy room the first room i was in was not two bad but as with alot of old hotels the door to the bathroom no longer closed and unfortunately the bath was so dirty i went out and bought cleaner for it
however the hotel itself is in one of the best locations in new york literally walk out the front door turn right and within 2 minutes your on times square at the prices they charge you cant get anything better
over the years i have heard horror storys about the carter but to be honest you just have to use common sense if your a single traveller and have a fancy laptop dont go and sit in the lounge using it at 1am and then return to your room the next time you go out chances are it wont be there when you get back also dont wave the fact youve just got paid around all of this is pretty much common sence but as alot of the people staying at the carter are young and have just finished working at summer camps in august and september of course they dont usually use common sence
during my stay the computers in the there lobby were upgraded to nice new dell machines with 2122 inch monitors dont worry about taking a laptop if you dont really need it as there is normally one free at anytime 
you dont see much of the staff but they tend to be friendly and helpful as long as your polite to them except one checkin lady who seems to be ready to flip for no reason again use common sence if you start shouting straight away they wont help but be polite and they can be very accomodating 
this isnt a four star hotel were you can walk into the lobby in your pjs with your laptop in the middle of the night and feel totally safe this is a hotel were you need to be aware of your surroundings but is always an interersting place to stay
also the hotel has improved alot over the last 5 years its still got a way to go but its heading in the correct direction",4.0
a night in dc,this is a very nice hotel well maintained and cared for and clean very friendly staff and easy checkin i enjoy it most for its location and the amenities that four points offer skip the hotel restaurant your in a great location for many other choices the service is well below standards here and until i see consistent good reviews on it i will not even stop in for a drink also elevators are very slow this hotel is in walking distance to many dc attractions and cabs are inexpensive in dc compared to most cities,5.0
nice location bad room,stayed in the hotel for 9 nights bed is comfortable but after a while me and my boyfriend felt itch and have some bug bit marks on our legs the 2nd last night the hotel had water issue hot water was brown my boyfriend has to take a cold shower when i try to take shower there was no cold water i been told there will be water in an hour after 4hours the cold water is back the hot water is still brown its not worth it,2.0
better than expected,i will have to admit first i was a little skeptical about how my stay was going to be at this property after reading some of the reviews just prior to my stay here to late to cancel i had to just find out for myself which im glad i did it was great location wise the one thing i will say is the elevator was a little slow and you needed your key to access it felt great for security but i was in town visiting family so when they came to visit me it was a little hassle to get them up but it wasnt a major problem front desk team could have been a little more welcoming but they got the job done overall not a bad choice if you need a hotel downtown,3.0
great location and good value,partner and i stayed here after our cruise to vancouver great location 1 12 blocks from the quick shuttle from vancouver and and easy walk to the space needle pike market and downtown free shuttle within 1 mile helped get us to the shuttle to seatac friendly service and breakfast included,5.0
great hotel convenient location,"stayed for 3 nights in early september  for less than 100 a night inc breakfast this hotel proved to be outstanding value in fact i cant think of another hotel that comes close of providing the facilitiesservices this hilton offered for that price
transfers from the hotel are available but youll probably end up needing a rental if youre heading out of the downtown area so you may as well pick up the car at the airport and drive the 10 mins to the hotel  its not a difficult route and there is amble selfparking available but the parking garage layout can be a little confusing
it seems a bit odd that in order to access some of the amenities sports bar starbucks etc you have to leave the hotel walk round a corner and enter from the outside then repeat the exercise to back into the hotel not a major trauma but its a bit bemusing that you cant access them from inside like you can the cocktail bar and restaurant
a quick walk over the bridge delivers you to the gaslamp area and more restaurantsbars that youll probably ever need and catering to every budget and preference if you just want to stretch your legs then the waterfront is right outside and you can wander along looking at various floating maritime attractions
breakfast is good with an amble buffet and portions from the menu are sufficient to see you through the morning and maybe more food at the fox sports bar is perfectly acceptable if somewhat predictable but then its a sports bar so you know exactly whats what
rooms are clean and tidy sensibly sized the same can be said for the bathroom higher floors have better views and if you plan to spend time looking out the window then opt for one overlooking the bridge rather than the container docks the higher up you go the less noise is apparent and theres little need to close the curtains  no one can look in  and if youre not fussed at the scenery then save yourself the extra  charged for the bridge view and stare out the window at nothing in particular from the comfort of the bed
im sure its an endless source of amusement to the checkin staff as bemused guests wander around the lobby looking for the elevators that take you to the floor youre looking for  it isnt immediately obvious
will be using this hotel again",4.0
best kept secret in downtown la,"this is an open letter to ian gee the general manager of the sheraton hotel downtown in los angeles this is my 11th consecutive year as a starwood platinum member and in all that time i have only been inspired on three other occasions to write a review of a property therefore i am honored to write this review to make known my gratefulness for youre staff providing such an exceptional experience at my recent stay at your property i had the opportunity to thank maricora earlier for her role in providing exceptional service upon checkin i appreciated your teams hospitality the room upgrades the early checkin the late checkout and the overall warmth and personal care your property extended to my guests and i 
to my peers here on trip advisor please know that when your travel calls for you to be in downtown los angeles dont spend hundred of dollars a night to stay in some overrated property the sheraton is inexpensive i booked my nights for only 159 a night and about 200 less then some of the other swanky hotels that dont come close to offering the warmth charm and value i found here at this property for those with access to it the concierge lounge was excellent a perfect place to unwind and get some work done with free refreshments and scrumptious appetizers the location is perfect close to everything the property is clean and warm and very cheerful every staff member that i encountered was authentically concerned about our comfort and enjoyment they really want to make sure your experience is memorable we took advantage of ordering some room service and were completely satisfied the food arrived hot and tasty in under 20 minutes the hotel was immaculate and felt very cozy the beds were a dream pun intended the rooms were clean as a whistle and the bathroom was luxurious 
i have informed daniel kerzner as he is the director of the starwood ambassador program and he should know i recommend he send his vip guests to stay under your care i have also shared my gratitude with tanja at starwood corporate as she is my personal travel ambassador and her manager laurie mcbeath they ask me to provide details whenever i encounter a truly exceptional experience that goes above and beyond the normal high standards starwood sets for its guests and you are without question the example they had in mind  in the words of one of your most famous govenors ill be back 
my finest and best regards

awful rooms most uncomfy beds obnoxious  rude conceirge and lacklustre manager,"stayed here on a recent trip to san fran with friends and considering the reputation of intercon and the cost of the room was expecting a 5 staywhat all four of us got was a four day backache from the terrible bed a headache from the anger at the treatment we received from the concierge service  the were so rude and obnoxious and made us feel as if we were not worthy of their assistance and on complaint to the manager  who responded with a glassy look in her eyes thanks for the feedback its always appreciated oh and to add insult to injury 40 per hour to use the internet
 all in all we were very disappointed with this hotel and i would not recommend it at all

handlery great if you get a special rate,this is a pretty good hotel located in san diegos hotel circle we were there for a group event so our pricing per night was almost half of what was listed on their web page the hotel is older but seemed to be kept up pretty well several nicks and scratches on the furniture but nothing terrible the bathrooms were older but kept clean and updated the best that they could without a complete overhaul ask for a balcany room overlooking the pool for the best experience if you dont ask you probably wont get checked in early around 1230pm with no problem on saturday evening they set up a large movie screen by the pool and showed the movie scooby doo several families were down at the pool sitting in lounge chairs enjoying the movie it was kinda neat the only thing is is that if your room overlooked the pool you could hear the movie with the sliding door open but it was shown early enough in the evening that it wasnt an annoyance the hotel circle area has many midrange hotels to choose from and this one is pretty good size and probably my favorite right now the only sad thing about the area is that with all the hotels there are few in any restaurants i guess the hotels want you to eat at their hotels but havent been lucky enough to eat at a good one there all in all not bad,4.0
great location good hotel,"the hilton in the inner harbor is a nice stay especially with that significant other the location is prime you have access to many restaurants bars clubs and other amenities the service is self explanatory w the hilton the rooms decor was nicely layed out over looking the city  night makes you feel goodthe gym and pool over look orioles stadium nice  fabolous voicemy problem which is the problem that i always have in staying  these hotels is the thin air circulation in the room i cant stand that  you and your partner will wake up in the middle of the night with some serious dry mouth scavenging for some water i know many people have experienced this before bring your humidifier lol other things that bothered me which is always common in luxury hotels is that everythings overpriced
but for a nice getaway for young couples i would recommend this hotel and location",4.0
needs to lose its crown,"i thought that the crowne plaza label was a higherend hotel chain for intercontinental which inclludes the holiday inn brand well i was wrong with this place it is a lowend holiday inn in disguise  no crowns for this dump i was here for one night only since i had to catch an early flight at lax
checkin  unprofessional  nothing went wrong but the clerks were behind the counter having graphic personal conversations
parking garage  i realize it is not managed by them but they have a sign out front directing you to park there so they have an interest in its appearance the elevator is filthy pieces of the formica has fallen off the elevator wall the ceiling panels are missing  makes you wonder about the mechanical capabilities of the elevator
halls  walking to our room small pieces of trash on the carpet doors slam shut  with a hotel that is going to get people inout at all hours to catch flights they should have a better door set up that dont slam the door to the room next to us slammed and literally shook our room
room  filthy carpet full of stains chipped furniture desk entertainment cabinet no safe in room expected for a hotel in my opinion small bathroom with extremely low counter  needed to bend over to wash up and no this was not a handicap room old tv not an updated hd flat screen
pros  location close to the airport i got a very good rate via priceline but priceline rated this as a 35 star hotel  no way  more like a 2 star 
i have not stayed at other hotels near lax but they have got to be better than this",1.0
the affinia 50 feels like home,after weeks of internet research and reading all the reviews on tripadvisor i decided to book the affinia 50 for a vacation stay with 3 other female family members what a great choice we arrived just a little past noon and the doorman saw us from the corner with our luggage and quickly came with a cart to greet us and help us get settled all of the staff members were helpful friendly and polite checkin was quick and easy and even though it was just past noon our onebedroom suite on the 9th floor was ready we were so surprised when we walked in and saw the size of the suite the living room and dining area were quite large and the kitchen even though small had a fullsized refrigerator microwave dishwasher dishes and a toaster the beds were big and comfy and the bathroom wasnt huge but was bigger than most other nyc hotels ive stayed in we really felt like we had our own little apartment in the city everything was very clean and the abundance of aveda products was a nice touch there was even a fitness room and a nice lounge on the second floor that i wish wed had more time to enjoy but we were out exploring most of the time the midtown east location was great  lots of shopping and restaurants nearby essabagel was great for getting breakfast bagels and a little shop called azure had milk fruit cereals soft drinks etc to take back to the room the walk to the times square area only takes about 15 minutes and there are subway lines closeby that get you anywhere you need to go i would definitely recommend the affinia 50 and i would stay there again without hesitation when you walk into the lobby the doorman always says welcome home and thats just how we felt  at home,5.0

loved this hotel,"i loved this hotel the company i work for is headquartered right next door to it so it is only a 3 minute walk as a result this is where they put up everybody that comes in to town for business trips to the general offices the sleep number bed was very comfortable and i really enjoyed it other people that work for my company said it did not inflatedeflate properly but mine worked great the staff is very friendly and attentive the breakfast buffet is pretty decent for a hotel breakfast buffet i had coupon vouchers provided by my company so i am not sure how much it cost i would not have been happy paying much more than 8 for it but it was good when it was free 
they have a little loungebar area near the lobby where we had a great time the beer selection was limited but the staff was excellent and they had flat screen hd tvs that were good i did not bring the proper attire to check out the pool or the fitness room but they looked solid the best i could tell i would definitely recommend staying here and i look forward to the day my company flies me back to seattle 
the only negative thing about this hotel experience was the shuttle was very limited that is to say it only went to the airport across the street and that was it i would like to see a free shuttle service that would go 23 miles in either direction that is all it would take to get to just about any restaurant other than that this place is top notch for the price i highly recommend it",5.0
great value for the ,after a day of shopping at san marcos outlets we stayed the night at ramada in austin for a 45 a night room we were very surprised it was roomy very clean the employees were extra helpful and very friendly we took a dip in the pool which was cool on a very hot day the room was quiet and the bed comfortable they offer a free happy hour and a great hot breakfast it was delicious we had scrambled eggs hash browns sausage oj coffee and a texas shaped waffle they also had many cereal pastry and bread selections the only negative is its a little confusing getting to from the interstate we also dined at land and cattle steak co for 10 each we had a wonderful steak dinner we truly enjoyed our stop over in austin,4.0
thanks michael ednilao,"i stayed at cova a classinlineadmedialink hrefhotela for 2 days and the staff were really helpful michael ednilao checked us in and upgraded us to a deluxe room i asked him why and he said today is my lucky day the shuttle to union square and fishermans warf were also helpful because i didnt have to walk around homeless people which is the down side of the hotel breakfast is good and the roof top is amazing if ever ill come back to san francisco im sure im spending my nights at this lovely hotel

great stay,"what a great hotel in a great location tribeca is a great jumping off point for seeing new york it has the feel of being where people seem to live and the smyth is right in the middle of that the subway stops right at the door literally and another is just a few steps away lots of great restaurants in the neighbourhood for breakfast and lunch check out the kitchenette on chambers st and for a great dinner try the odeon cafeteria on w broadway
but the hotel itself an upgrade for my birthday was just the start the rooms are comfy and beautiful and the bathroom was awash with towels and amenities but the best part of the smyth is the staff the desk people were always friendly helpful and courteous but william and ela the concierges were outstanding friendly patient full of great tips and personal knowledge and eager to please us they couldnt have done more for us if they had taken us to our destinations themselves 
all and all a great place to stay its our second visit but wont be our last",4.0
w union square  not very wonderful,"we have stayed at many w hotels dozens of times and this particular visit was the only time we were met with so much disappointment
while the decor of the hotel was quite hip and the location was very good the service was really lacking here are some examples
  we checked in at 630 pm after a long day of travel and our room was not ready it still hadnt been cleaned
  the next day we were gone from 9am until 5pm and when we returned after a long day of sightseeing our room had not been cleaned
  turn down service was only offered once on a fournight stay
  we had 2 nonsmoking rooms and of the rooms reeked of cigarette smoke they kept saying they would put some kind of filter in it to clear it up but they kept forgetting and didnt do it until the 4th of day of our stay
  we decided to eat breakfast one morning at the the hotel restaurant  olives six of us ordered cereals granola and bagels at 915 am nothing that to be cooked i told the waiter we had to be out of the restaurant by 10 and at at 950 our food still had not arrived when we complained it came in shifts and it was not even correct
  the construction in union square began with jackhammers at 7am it sounded like someone was tapping a fork really loud on your bedside table and we were on the 17th floor",2.0
absolutely pathetic service,"okay  there was a blackout for 7 hours which was not the hotels fault but what transpired during the blackout makes me really angry when i think about it not once did the hotel try to contact guests over a telephone system that was still working there were fire trucks outside and alarms going off and nothing  10 floors on the hotel maybe they could find ten employees with flashlights to go through the floors making some kind of announcement people whos windows were not facing the right way had complete darkness people who were entering the hotel during the blackout were given necklaces that you get an amusement park that glows and told to walk to their rooms 
i could go on but enough  you get the message  the hotel did not care one bit for its guests and even pushed people out early the next day offering a paltry free coffee",1.0
everything the business traveler needs for a comfortable stayin detroit,"i have to go to detroit a few times a year for business purposes and i always stay at the hilton garden inn in general hilton garden inns are good bets for business travelers because most contain the following free internet access microwave fridge very comfortable bedding quiet guests who are also business travelers and not partiers fitness center and pool the one in detroit has a breakfast diner that serves the typical breakfast farei always get pancakes and the fresh fruit 
the staff at this particular garden inn are very courteous and accommodating one hotel desk manager was especially kindi think his name was dwayne perhaps staff were very helpful and responsive 
the hotel is located in a somewhat odd area but all areas of detroit are kind of odd at this point in time the city is riddled with closeddown shops and restaurants each section of the city is hitormiss on each block the hilton garden inn is within walking distance to comerica park and ford field game nights tend to attract rowdier guests the hotel is also within walking distance to a cvs ben and jerrys and the hard rock cafe just ask hotel staff to point you in the right direction",4.0

the staff working at the hotel is great particularly ellen who worked at the concierge desk was fantastic she made the whole process faster and more efficient my friend and i arrived a little earlier than the check in time which is 4pm but she was able to find us a room without making us wait it really made our experience a lot better

great hotel in the middle of the action,spent 3 nights here in a partial water view thanks to the manager who upgraded me from a straight city ciew room this is a lovely hotel surprisingly quiet given its location just metres from the pike street market comfy beds very clean bathrooms unobtrusive service and good restaurants on site bacco for breakfast was excellent but busy with lovely food and fresh juices very good place to stay in the heart of seattle,4.0
prime location with phenomenal views from balcony  bfast buffet,i recommend asking for a high floor overlooking logan square the view is spectacular elevators are not slow unless there are many stops which during peak check in and out times they are very slow breakfast buffet is downstairs in the tgi fridays and very acceptable all in all this hotel is a great value oh and free beer and full alcohol bar each evening in the lobby for the managers reception parking is very expensive and you should really just not bring your car here anyway if you must park the garage across the street is 10 cheaper per day,5.0
take care in booking this hotel,i stayed here 4260642906 this hotel is undergoing floorbyfloor renovations as a priceline guest paying just 60 a night i was only offered a runofthehouse roomsmoking on the third floor with the comment from the front desk clerk that that was all they could do because i booked the room online i couldnt breath for three nights i could hear late night noise from people exiting nearby clubs on the street and i was awakened at 530 one morning by the slamming of a liftgate on a foodservice truck making a delivery below my window add to this a security guard firm was using a room down the hall for hiring with people camped outside the elevator not a pleasant stay at all in another room on another floor this would have been a great deal sometimes you get what you pay for,2.0
never stay here,"just one word  terrible 
i read many reviews before our stay and became very convinced that the hotel would be great i booked for 8 nights and got a pretty good rate for the queen pod
we arrived at the hotel in the evening after a 9h flight and some hours immigration queuing i had asked the hotel for a quiet room in forhand to make sure we would get some sleep 
the room was really small and had a window to the bathroom why our room was located in the ninth floor so i was sure it was going to be silent but outside our window there was a huge chimney and about 5 acdevices that made a horrible noice it was like staying inside the engine room of a passanger boat we tried to get some sleep in the hardasconcrete bed when the time was 0700am and we had slept about a blink of an eye i went downt to the reception and informed that we were going to change hotel
the decoration and lightning in the corridor were straight from some brothel they even had half nude people running around
the only good thing about this place was that they didnt try to argue when we wanted to leave

very comfortable stay,i am here with my son for our first trip to new york we chose this hotel as it is one of the few to have twin beds our room is big spacious and clean and comfortable we have a room to the rear on the 17th floor of the north tower so the view over the city skyline is spectacular staff are friendly and helpful the location is greatcentral being close to columbus circle and central park they even filmed an episode of law and order here the other day the lobby area and the bar are very nice my 17 year old son was able to sit with me and have a soft drink i would definitely come here again so long as i could get one of the higher up rooms with the fabulous views very nice hotel,4.0
perfection has a name four seasons in beverly hills,"we stayed two nights in a suite in this hotel when we arrived we met one of the most friendliest receptionists ever he was very interested in europe and the netherlands we were escorted to the room together with our luggage this is very efficient
the room was beautiful decorated a large living room and a large bedroom we had two bathrooms in the room they have an ipad so you can order roomservice concierge assistance etc from the ipad 
the spa area is beautiful but without rest area the swimming pool is heated the service is like the rest of the hotel perfect i went to the gym and sauna and left my bracelet in a locker the staff from the spa did not know my name but when i was in the lobby the receptionist came to me and said that i left my bracelet in the spa so they could describe me and reception did know who i was the spa reception excused because they did not know my name i said that i liked the service a lot as they knew me all the staff know you immediately for example when we had breakfast on our second day the lady in the restaurant knew what we ordered the day before another lady in the restaurant she served lunch the former day knew us and came to us for a small talk this is service we appreciate and like 
one thing that was not top was the reservation for a restaurant i gave 2 names to the concierge for a restaurant thought it was one restaurant but by accident gave 2 different restaurants i also said that if they did not have a table i wanted to go to another trendy restaurant they made reservations for one of the two i gave unfortunately this was not a trendy restaurant partly it was my fault as i gave two names partly the concierge could contact me and asked which restaurant i was more interested for the food in the other restaurant was good but i expected another restaurant
we liked this hotel so much if we return to la we definitely will come back this hotel is known for the service we got the best service in america in this hotel",5.0
simply the best,the staff very very friendly and knowledgeable great midtown location rooms very clean received cookies upon arrival we were checked in by vicki employee of over thirty years she went above and beyond to meet all our needs i will choose this hotel in the near future,5.0
a tad expensive the roosevelt  but the old 20s decor makes up for it,"my wife and i stayed in the roosevelt for 3 days whilst we were on a short break to new york the rooms are quite small but the decor is in the 1920s theme and i think thats when the hotel was built 
we really enjoyed are stay and it is central for everything in nyc we even used the room service one night at a cost of about  50 like other people have mentioned it is just around the corner from central station 
lots has been already said about this hotel so i will keep it short
lots of rooms reasonable service and staff expensive to stay but it is central like a comfortable suit its got it all  nice

one of the best hotels ive ever stayed at,"literally i would go to new york again just to stay at this hotel i could not fault this hotel in the slightest it is modern it is clean the staff were the nicest and most helpful ive ever come across the roof top terrace was amazing relaxing by day and buzzing by night the location was top notch
the hotel
the hotel itself is modern and clean it has an amazing rooftop terrace and is also connected to the rare bar  grill which serves lovely food
the rooms
me and my partner stayed in one of the suites and my friends stayed in the standard room the suite was absolutely worth the money theyre not that much more expensive than the standard rooms and the amount of space you get is incredible for the price all modern furnishings with a wet room large comfortable bed the most comfortable bed ive ever slept on i went in to my friends room which was the standard room this was modern clean and same comfortable bed which was a large double enough space to walk around etc and just in general a really nice room
location
took about 10 minutes to get to 34th street where there is and endless amount of shops and also just a couple of blocks away there are many little bars and irish pubs and restaraunts which are not crowded by tourists and along with it cheap prices including 1 draft night on tuesdays literally you come out the hotel you turn left if you want to head out and see the sights and the main shopping areas or you turn right if you want to see the more local side of new york little bars and pubs and restaraunts that arent extremely busy and rather cheap
the reception staff gave me a list of restaraunts to try out each one was absolutely amazing and the food was better than anything i had in times square or on 34th street
across the street and down a little bit literally two minutes you have a little convenience store if you need anything down a few blocks you have a uro diner which reminds me of the classic american diners you see in the films that serve all the pancakes and large milkshakes and everything
couldnt have asked for a better location when i was visiting new york
thank you to everybody at the affinia for what was an amazing stay",5.0
nice hotel location just okay,"the distrikt hotel is a very nice design hotel located across the street from the port authority bus terminal 
the hotel has minimalist design and small rooms that are comfortable and clean the free wifi works well and they include nice little touches such as chocolates on your pillow a new york times every morning and complimentary beverages in the lobby on a rainy day they had platy of umbrellas available for guests
the only downside is the neighborhood it isnt terrible  they have cleaned up the port authority a lot in recent years but the neighborhood is less fun than may others in manhattan that said there are some great restaurants in hells kitchen and times square that are only a short walk away it is also very convenient to the javits center",4.0
loved the location will recommend it to friends fabulous room,staff were very friendly from our first greeting at the cab door when taking our bags to our speedy check in we had one of the renovated rooms on the 15th floor a two bedded suite which was immaculately clean the beds were extremely comfortable just what was called for after long days treking the city this was my first time staying in ny city with my 12yr old son and im really glad i choose this hotel for its location comfort and safety i thought it was a bit overpriced initially when booking on line but after 4 nights stay it was so worth it i would definitely stay here again but would book earlier in advance to get a better deal i loved the fact that they held our luggage after check out so that we could browse the streets for a few hours before we actually left town and yes i had read about the noise from the firestation nearby but after the 2nd night it didnt really bother uswe were so exhausted we slept soundly,4.0
awesome family trip,my husband and i spent labor day weekend at this hotel with our 2 girls ages 2 and 3 at first we were looking into staying downtown as there was an art fair we wanted to attend but after much consideration we found this hotel and read the reviews and thought wed give it a shot it looked more kidfriendly than the hotels in downtown san diego it really exceeded our expectations great water front location great staff clean rooms nice decor nice outdoor pool  patio area and excellent food options in the area there is a nice walkway and about a mile from the hotel there is a nice park with two playgrounds one for older kids and the other for toddlers also in the liberty station area there is a restaurant called the corvette diner that we stumbled upon which is a 50s diner where the staff dresses up and the women have beehive hairstyles and dance around the girls loved it and so did we the location of the hotel is convenient and close to downtown and coronado which we loved highly recommend,5.0
good location,"unassuming hotel within easy walking distance to madison square park flatiron building madison square garden empire state building and 34th street shopping area the decor is fashion themed  multicoloured mural made of thread spools in lobby mannequins in front window and sewing themed prints in hotel rooms interestingly there is no sewing kit provided
my daughter and i had room 1103 with 2 double beds very comfortable roomy tiny closet but adequate for a weekend stay has a safe inside nice bathroom although the sink leaks  solved by placing the waste basket underneath bite sized cupcakes at reception was a very delicious touch the biggest disappointment in this day and age is that they charge for internet connection  quite unusual for most equivalent hotels",4.0
great staff hotel needs refresh,"we stayed in le meridien for over 3 days during the week while we had some social and business events the best thing about le meridien is that they allow dogs awesome second the staff are really great very attentive and client oriented 
however their rooms do need a refresh we stayed on a high floor in a junior suite but the room just felt dusty and a bit worn the bed was not particularly comfortable overall however it was clean i would really hesitate now to put my business travelers here
the lobby also needs some help there were several noticeable large dark stains on the lobby carpet right upon check in and walking through the lobby 
overall great location nice staff but the property itself is discouraging",3.0
once grand now mediocre doesnt live up to its name,"i usually associate this hotel chain with upscale properties sadly this hotel has passed its prime 
the carpets are dirty and threadbare in places there was a patch under the desk in our room that was actually coming unsewn
the poor maintence man had to come to our room three times for a clogged toilet i know dont say it
the ice machines on 3 of the 4 floors were not working
the chrome on the fixtures in the bathroom was coming off
we booked our room through hotwire and the price we paid through it was just about right or even a little too much
they count on special events to fill the place when we were there there was a soccer tournament nearby can you imagine what that was like wisely the kids were banned from certain floors 
now the good nice personnel
in short id opt for other places nearby which are much nicer newer and cheaper
look for this crown plaza to be removed from the crown plaza line of hotels soon it simply doesnt measure up to their high standards",2.0
great hotel in heart of korea town nyc,we booked a block of rooms at hotel stanford for our wedding this past fall and the hotel was a dream its by far the most affordable hotel that is centrally located and we love ktown so that was a major plus the rooms are not huge but definitely a decent standard size they are very clean and have all the amenities you would expect customer service was excellent curtis an assistant manager in the group reservations department was incredibly helpful very responsive and prompt with emails and phone messages and personally greeted us when we arrived room service and housekeeping were also very helpful the executive suites are very nice especially the bathrooms which have showers and bathtubs id definitely recommend this hotel for individual travelers and for groups,5.0

bed and breakfast on a larger scale,"once again my partner and i had to leave the heat of texas and go somewhere we felt at home we went to the hotel figueroa and enjoyed ourselves as always in paradisethe feeling is of a bed and breakfast but on a larger scale we sat by the poolwhich by the way is the nicest i have seen and spoke to a couple from brazilthat night having drinks at the bar we engaged in conversations with some dutch people along with some from australia
 our room had a king size bed and plenty of closet spacethe canopy and flowing fabrics above the bed made it a romantic and relaxing feeling when you went to sleepwe inquired about the other rooms from the owner uno and he graciously told us about the history of the rooms he showed usit was fascinating to hear all the stories
 each time we stay there i find something else about this hotel that marvels me and makes it even more special
 in a world where people have become so into themselves this place makes you feel like there is hope out there when other countries can sit down together and just laugh",5.0
great hotela must stay,this was my first time visiting chicago it was a family trip so i wanted it to be a memorable and rewarding experience the palmer house was definitely the place to make this happen the hotel was great had a little plumbing problem notified the front desk and we were placed in another room and compensated i really enjoy the historic ness of the hotel and my eleven year old daughter loved it would definitely stay here again its in the heart of everything could not have picked a better hotel the breakfast buffet was awesome homemade omelets cooked to order and all the extras you could want the concierge was a great help very knowledgeable about the surroundings loved it loved it loved it the beds were like sleeping on clouds,5.0
elegant hotel in a good location,"we stayed at the algonquin for 5 nights on our first ever visit to new york the location in the theatre district is very good it is not too far from the metro although no stop is really close either 
reception was consistently friendly and helpful 
the room was not large but perfectly comfortable had a very good double bed flat screen tv a nice little walk in cupboard and a large room safe the bathroom was a decent size very clean and had bath  shower with lots of powerful hot water
overall the hotel has a bit of elegance it is not just a standard box with standard box rooms it is in a quieter street and there is a very good diner  the red flame  for breakfast just a couple of doors down there are several other restaurants near the hotel too
i think this was a really good choice of hotel",4.0
best hotel for the money in nyc,i found this hotel in the aaa guidebook in 1986 i havent stayed anywhere else on my trips to nyc the location and price have always more than met my needs its close to central park subways and right across the street from carnegie hall the staff is friendly and helpful the elevators can be slow at peak times and the 4 continental breakfast could be better but i will continue to stay at the salisbury on my next trips to the big apple,4.0
honeymoon retreat,"my husband and i enjoyed a wonderful 2night stay at the langham due to work commitments we had had to postpone our honeymoon for almost a year and finally were able to take a muchneeded vacation back to my home state of massachusetts we stayed at several properties during that time and the langham far exceeded the rest in quality and service in making our reservation we had noted that the trip was a honeymoon and when we arrived at our room we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine hors doeuvres beautiful roses and a handwritten card it was a lovely unexpected touch
the hotel itself is extremely convenient in location  just steps from quincy market and faneuil hall and close to all the shopping you could hope for the room was very clean and quiet and had a great view of the financial district plush robes and slippers are provided and the beds are extremely comfortable the bathroom was large and spacious 
the only difficulty we had was in finding parking when we first arrived but that was handled fairly quickly well be staying at the langham again when we return to boston",4.0
excellent location friendly staff and comfy rooms,my daughter and i stayed here for a week our room was a great size with a kitchenette the room was quiet and comfortable i agree with one of the other reviews that plates would have been helpful in the kitchenette but we made due we grabbed some extra disposable cutlery at whole foods the little coffee shop down the street has wonderful croissants and the best apple juice which we enjoyed eating on the roof top of the hotel loved the neighbourhood and felt very safe at all times of day and night close to grand central station an easy walk for a six year old we cant wait to come back,5.0
grand service location and fireworks,"we stayed at the willard hotel for several days over the july 4th holiday our taxi brought us to the front of the hotelwow the pictures do not do it justice we were greeted by friendly staff at the door and directed to checkin the ceiling in the lobby is magnificent the state seals of each state is painted on the ceilingjust beautiful there is an antique room key divider behind the desk our bags were brought up to our room promptly we had a beautiful room extremely large suite with luxurious vintage carrera marble bathroom extremely clean room with comfortable beds with a view of the side streetunfortunately loud construction complete with concrete trucks jackhammers started that night at midnight and continued until 7am we were moved that morning to another room with an apology from the front desk staff the second room was smaller but just as clean and comfortable
we used the exercise room which is in the spa area downstairs the exercise room looks out to the sunbathing area in a courtyard
a bbq was held at the parc restaurant outside on the 4th looked good but we ate elsewhere
the fireworks were amazing we sat outside the hotel and had a fantastic view 
staff at the willard were courteousholding doors open for our daughters and ourselves hailing taxis etc 
location was great for us with two children corner bakery was near the rear entrance of the hotelclose to metroand shopping cvs 
i would highly recommend the willard hotel",5.0

horrible customer service,my husband and i stayed here twice this year and each visit was extremely disappointing first im not one to nit pick but i do expect quality customer service each time this establishment was under par the general manager is clueless on our first visit i filled out the guest survey and she sent us a letter for an upgrade to a suite if we gave them another chance you would have thought they would have made some kind of note on our account to make sure that our every need was taken care of for our visit not the case called room service and asked for a bottle of champagne the rep said that she didnt have the liquor cabinet key and she wasnt going to be able to do that for us not one attempt to resolve the situation or just say of course and figure it out on her own our room was not properly cleaned empty champagne bottle left in room chairs askew from the table countless of things but what made me more upset than anything was how the general manager handled the complaint not only that but the president of the company wasnt much better and gave her employee the way out instead of apologizing for her general manager behavior if you want decent hotel service i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,1.0

college roomies reunion was great at the hilton garden inn,"my college roomies and i spent a wonderful 4 day weekend at this hotel it is the staff that makes this hotel experience wonderful there was a little mix up at checkin when our room still was not ready by check in time but the staff quickly corrected this and gave us breakfast vouchers for the hotel restaurant we were very pleased they were more than happy to check our baggage when we arrived early the day of checkin and then again when we had a later flight after we checked out our room was always clean and the few times that we ran into housekeeping the ladies were so friendly and cheery the front doorman got to know our faces and always had something funny and cheerful to say to us 
the location was great the subway just a mere block or two away depending on which color you needed times square was literally just around the corner and over a couple of blocks and we came to love the fact that the hotel was slightly removed from the chaos there you could be in the heart of it all in a few steps but you didnt have to fight crowds every time you went out the front door 
our room was lovely the microwave and minirefrigerator are a rare find in an nyc hotel room the size of both the room and the bathroom was very large by any standard not just nyc standards the room not only had two beds but two queen beds which i have not seen in any other nyc hotel the room stayed temperate all the time which we loved since the temperature outside hung at about 95 degrees during our visit wifi was free and easy to access we would come in the door after a long day and say were home",5.0
great party and excellent party planner at this hotel,we had a birthday party for approx 25 guests at the pools at this location we dealt with jennifer bryant the party planner at this hotel she went above and beyond to help us and deal with our budget she even stopped by at our party to see how it was going i highly recommend this party host and this location the location was spectacular with two beautiful pools water slide great cabanas and excellent food choices my 13 year old and her guests were thrilled i cant wait to plan another party with jennifer bryant and the pointe hilton at tapatio cliffs in phoenix arizona,5.0

nice clean with large rooms,we stayed here in july for a mini family vacation we had two large rooms that were very clean the lobby was nice with free wireless internet access adjacent to the holiday inn express which had an indoor pool which we could use had underground parking and was a 5 minute walk to the space needle could use the monorail to get to downtown we used the free bus service to jump from underground station to underground station to get around town we paid 89 which was the cheapest the manager had seen with the entertainment card,5.0
great place to put your wedding guestsand the bride and groom,my husband and i reserved a room block at the holiday inn center city for our wedding guests as well as ourselves for the wedding night we were having our reception at a local venue along the charlotte light rail and wanted guests to be able leave the reception and easily get to the hotel andor go out on the town for the rest of the night in addition we rented a suite at the hotel to get ready in for the wedding the staff at the hotel was amazing after getting ready we wanted to use some areas of the hotel for pictures and the staff was great about helping us access these rooms in addition they allowed us to use the rooftop to take additional night time photos they also made sure all of our guests received their out of town gift bags when they checked in all of the rooms have been renovated and are extremely clean we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a room block or just a nice place to stay in charlotte,5.0

second visit thoughts 4 years on,"we first visited the grand del mar the year it opened and were very impressed hence when the opportunity came to visit san diego again we did not hesitate to book a second stay
was it as good as the first time almost the staff and hotel itself were excellent standards as high as before all the staff were very courteous and friendly and the rooms were beautifully kept with no expense spared to provide beautiful towels and bed linens daily
only a couple of grumpy comments regarding the adults only no cellphone rule at the quiet poolwhy put families with young children in the rooms opening directly onto the serenity pool area and why dont other guests take note of the no cellphone rule this was really annoying as people could not be bothered to get off their backsides and move away from the pool area to speak on their phone when im trying to relax and read in a quiet area i do not want to hear other peoples boring conversations a few of the pool attendants mostly young students were brave enough to ask guests to put the phones away but the majority did nothing about it the hotel needs to make this rule more obvious there are signs but not big enough ones
another tip would be to check your account daily which you can do on the room tv as we found that on the first day somebody else had charged their breakfast to our room it was taken off our account but best to do it as soon as it occurs and saves time on checkout we paid cash as much as possible and ate breakfast at the cafe on the third floor and kept all receipts until the end of our stay in case there were any other occurances
finally as the hotel is spread out over three floors there can be a very long walk to the room ours was at a far corner of the hotel which involved a trek to the lobby and pool area there was probably a short cut by going outside but we never discovered it therefore if you find a long walk too much request a room close to the centre of the hotel
we spent 13 nights there and it was definitely more enjoyable for us when the weekend crowd disapeared as the pool area was a lot more relaxing which was the main reason for our stay trying to pack a years worth of sun into 2 weeks important when you live in rainy england the hotel is much busier than during our last trip but we were also there during the 4th july which is a major deal in the us and we are glad that the hotel is obviously enjoying success
on balance still one of my favourite hotels to stay at",4.0
it didnt meet my expectations,"i stayed in this hotel in midjuly with my family and to be honest this hotel isnt really what i expected the hotel looked more of and office block what made the hotel even more undesirable was the extremely noisy air conditioning in the room this made our sleep unbearable too when we arrived it was over 100 and when we went in our room there was one bottle of water for 6 and when we checked out it took 15 minutes
i had higher expectations for this class of hotel",2.0
small but perfectly formed,"i was really happy with hotel azure
the staff were friendly and really helpful with local restaurant tips and things to do that tourists wouldnt know about the local secrets
our room was very small but perfectly arranged and we had completely expected space to be a premium in new york city
the hotel is at the corner of little italy soho and chinatown and there is a great buzz around the area with local delights in close proximity
we were in walking distance to the brooklyn bridge and the financial district and a subway station right next to the hotel which definitely helps
the hotel looked after our bags even once we had checked out for the rest of the day free local calls from the hotel
basically i would sum hotel azure up as
small but perfectly formed
i would happily stay there again

good service great location,i recently stayed here for 4 nights on a vacation to san antonio the hotel staff was friendly and very helpful the accomodations were clean and comfortable we had difficulty with ordering nfl sunday ticket on our tv and the hotel staff were kind enough to spend a half hour attempting to troubleshoot the problem and when they found out that the service was down for the entire hotel they comped us free breakfast for the remainder of our stay the hotel location was perfect for enjoying the downtown area and i loved that room service was available 24hrs i would definitely stay at this hotel again if i return to the area,5.0
another lovely hotel with poor staff,"hotel was beautiful just like something right out othe pages of history the staff however well they were lacking to say the least when i came to check in i was clearly bothering ann i think that was her name at the front desk she was englufed in whatever she was typing and who am i to interupt the bellman were just as rude had to say excuse me as we walked through the front door becuase the doorman and the bellman were standing in the doorway talking when we had to check bags i was handed a ticket and that was it no do you know where you are going or come pick them up here later perhaps i am asking for too much when i checked out i had our bags held came back later on and stood at the bellstand while the same bellman stood talking to someone else who worked there and kept looking at us we clearly needed help but he was again too busy talking to be concerned with us he finally came over and tells us that he does not have a key the other bellman has the only key 
our suite was beautiful though great touch with the bottles of water and plums in the room ac in the bedroom did not work as well as it did in the living room and our bed had no sheet just a duvet",3.0
great stay night before cruise,i knew we  adult son 22 yrs old pre teen daughter 12 yrs and self would have a long drive to our cruise port out of jacksonville fl wanted a nice place for us all to sleep comfortably the night before our cruise after the drive in and that was close by the port after searching decided to stay here last sept 18 2011 and was so glad i did we arrived late the front desk was pleasant even at the unpleasant hour of night   directed us to the closest door and directions to our room the room was very large and nicely laid out for the three of each having our own queen bed to sleep in very clean room  nice breakfast and met several other guests going on the same cruise  a pre cruise get together lol check out was not until noon which was a huge plus since we could not check in to our cruise until noon we didnt use the pool or fitness room due to arriving late evening but did visit appeared clean with extra towels in fitness area would highly recommend this hotel and stay here again if taking another cruise out of jacksonville in the future,5.0
lots of wow,"we booked 5 nights through priceline and got a real bargain but had to stay there just to say we did there are renovations going on outside so maybe thats why were able to stay for 200 a night
let me say this place is nice our room was big enough for two rooms in some hotels and it looked great we overlooked park avenue from the 9th floor
we didnt eat at the hotel because its certainly very pricey the staff was extremely good and everything was spotless
it is well located for most activities and we always felt safe in the neighbourhood
one little thing that bugged me was they charge 16 per day for wifi that most hotels offer for free it seemed a little odd for a premium hotel
it would be an incredible place if you had an unlimited budget but if money matters to you at all youd best think hard about this one",4.0
w hotel is the best in dallas hands down,"my wife and i stayed at the w hotel on our anniversary recently so we could walk to dinner at kenichi and go to a concert at house of blues the service was an after thought for us when booking but i have to say i have not experienced such excellent service from any company in a long time
thomas the general manager saw to it that every special request i made was fulfilled exactly as i had requested and even took it a step further from check in to to inroom service and every experience in between it was perfect the atmosphere is great rooms are always immaculate and it was service with a smile all around we stay at the ritz on occasion but i much prefer the attitude at the w  luxury all the way  hip",5.0

fanciest hotel ive ever stayed in,"i shot a wedding here and was amazed with the hotel when i walked in right next to the white house incredible the front desk was very helpful and informative as i didnt have a good idea of where anything was the lobby itself is quite impressive the gym was great and not crowded at all huge bonus for the gym being open 247 location cant get any better did i mention its next to the white house i only have two negatives one is the parking the only option is 40 valet parking its dc i understand i guess the other negative is wifi isnt included really guys i personally wouldnt have paid for it but i also travel on a much tighter budget really nice hotel

central location impersonal atmosphere,"i stayed a long weekend at the gansevoort park in late january and i wasnt altogether impressed after the success of the original gansevoort downtown there was significant hype about the opening of one closer to midtown the gansevoorts location at a good median between uptown and downtown is probably the hotels largest asset as its atmosphere definitely is not the decor though trendy is not very tasteful and did not feel particularly luxe or interesting when we were at the gansevoort the lobby was always impersonal and empty save for blaring house music and even verged on feeling kind of pathetic the room with a view of park ave was function though rather spare and the design did not feel very rich from the lobby to the halls to the guestroom the whole hotel felt cold and impersonal and the passiveness of the staff did not help 
the service at the gansevoort park while not terrible was certainly not standout the staff seemed to prefer standing beside the elevator rather than going out of their way the help small things could be changed to improve the experience greatly for example we were offered the hotels porsche to take us uptown and the driver apparently the car breaks down if it goes above 50th simply dumped us at the corner of 50th and madison when in reality we were headed fifteen blocks away
overall the gansevoort park is a decent but not special hotel and a very good value if discount rates can be found there are so many other choices of fivestars in nyc that i likely would not stay at the gansevoort park again",3.0
comfortable hotel downtown,"a massive hotel  really a shopping center within a hotel interesting design that has been filmed in a number of movies glass cylinder towers with elevators that run on the outside on the lower levels are take out places as well as some sit down restaurants the pub with outdoor patio was fabled for having one of the best burgers in downtown la  and the burger was very good there are also other shops the hotel itself has a few restaurants and a bar at the lobby level there is a starbucks across the ramp from the pool the outdoor pool is pleasant  a massive office building overlooks it which can be a pleasant irony
my room was small but comfortable  very clean and fairly well appointed  although a bit dated bed was very nice due to the cylndrical nature of the hotel the windows on the room curve around
the hotel is downtown and as such street parking is virtually nonexistent hotel parking is 25 per day expensive but they were fairly efficient and pleasant there is another lot across the street from the hotel parking entrance but i dont know the cost
id probably stay here again if i wanted to be in dowtown la",4.0
good stay and great location,i stayed at the sofitel the weekend of aug 11th thru the 13th and i would definitely stay againthe hotel was nice and cleanthe staff was polite and helpfuland i have no complaints about my roommy room was clean and everything workedi could even see the hollywood sign from my bedthe only downside is the poolits small and dosent fit the hotelbut that didnt stop me from getting my feet wetin other newsyour right in the middle of everythingwalk out the front door and rodeo dr is 10 mins to your rightthe groove and farmers market is 5 mins to your leftsanta monica pier is about 20 mins behind youvenice beach is about 2025 mins in front of youand if you dont feel like driven the beverly center is right across the streetdefinitely check this place out,4.0
not good for your health,"i would not recommend the hotel for many many reasons 
1 service and attitude  really a mixed bag some staff very helpful and friendly and others just talking amongst themselves and ignoring the guest
2 lobby  so unattractive cold and unwelcoming
3 location  although convenient the restaurant was closed midday and there really is nothing for sit down in the immediate area 
4 breakfast at shulas  terribly overpriced and the fruit was brown 
5 rooms  clean and comfortable but i asked for an nonfragranced room and guess what i got after two rooms moves a fragranced room 
starwood has to get rid of these awful smelling rooms deodorizers those of us with allergies and asthma cannot stay with you this is dangerous to our health 
bottom line i love starwoods but found this westin a big step down from the brand that i had imagined you are over promising and under delivering 
sorry but its true ps stay well is not a good brand line since you obviously do not care about those of us with severe fragrance allergies",3.0
great hotel,the hotel was fabulous housekeeping was excellent and is close to the alamo riverwalk and is attached to a mall i got a great price for this hotel because of the conference i attended otherwise it is a bit pricy,4.0
a new years to remember,my partner was eager to spend new years eve in new york and i reluctantly agreed all i could picture were crowds noise and tacky 2007 sunglasses we made our reservation a few weeks prior and got a reasonable rate the hotel is close to times square but we decided to brave it and drive in surprisingly enough i recieved a phone call from an employee at city club two days prior to our arrival informing us of the street closures in and around times square she was very pleasant suggesting that if we were driving to leave early not something i would expect from a nyc boutique hotel she even offered directions from new jersey by train if we decided against taking the car i must admit this was a nice gesture we arrived at city club and were greeted by the bellman at the curb the check in was quick and the staff offered assistance with dinner reservations and some suggestions on what was going on around town we had already had made reservations so declined their assistance before we knew it we were upstairs in our room which was wonderfully appointed clean and comfortable in size the water pressure in the shower was amazing the beds very comfortable and the service impressive i felt like i was part of the family right away though our dinner reservations were not the best choice for us maybe we shouldve taken the offer for help at checkin our stay at city club was great ive already recommended it to my friends and will stay again and the best part was we didnt even feel like we were near times square,5.0

friendly hotel in a central location,"i enjoyed my stay at the handlery  i would stay there again as a family of four two adults two adultsized teenagers it was a good place to stay in terms of accommodation location  hotel atmosphere given that the hotel is in the city centre it was sometimes noisy but i guess it is difficult to have one without the other our sleep wasnt disturbed
i very much appreciated the hotel offer of free breakfast vouchers in the daily grill as san francisco is not a cheap city to stay in
one san francisco tip if you are travelling in august  bring warm clothes",4.0
great value at the renaissance,"i booked this hotel through aacom and got a 79usd fare per night for that price this hotel was highly satisfying the location wasnt glamorous but it was very convenient close to the airport i arrived by midnight so that was a good thing and with easy access to most freeways
the room wasnt particularly big but it was comfortable the bed was what you would expect for a chain hotel like this one great sleep bathroom and décor were just average 
i didnt request much from the hotel staff so i cant say much about the service i had a nice stay and i would definitely stay here again if i got a similar rate",4.0
great hotel in a superb location,stayed in the chancellor hotel and its really very good the room had all the facilities we needed there was no teacoffee making facilities in the room but they had it free in the hotel lobby the staff were helpful and friendly and the location was brilliant for the tour buses and restaurants,4.0
great stay,if you are going to the theater or doing midtown activities the marriott marquis is in an excellent location we were so impressed by the helpful staff everywhere housekeeping was excellent very clean room and our towels were thick our king room had a fold out sofa  perfect for me and my two teens the beds are very comfortable the view of times square was fantastic and instead of watching tv at night the kids would stare out the window our room seemed quiet not a lot of outside noise however the walls are a bit thin and you could hear your neighbor use the bathroom next to you toilet flush and phone ring we were very lucky to have calm respectful people staying on either side of us so we had no noise issues overall most of the guests were very pleasant not the las vegas type that come in the room and start a party at all hours the only criticism i have are the restaurant prices im willing to pay extra for the convenience of an inhouse restaurant but the marriott was too overpriced at least for dinner we were able to walk two blocks down 46th street to restaurant row and had some great food and no wait,5.0
awful stay will never return,"june 26thjune 28th we have stayed at this hotel every time we have come to baltimore
it has always been a great getaway and we always look forward to our stay there 
our last stay was awful
 the front desk girl that was there was very hospitable we arrived 5 hours before check in time and she still found us a room right away she was very kind and always willing to help out with whatever we needed she made us dinner reservations and even brought our bottle of wine to our room 
the housekeeping staff could not understand a word that we said and we had left things on the dresser and in the bathroom when we went out for the day and everything was moved around when we came back it took me a few minutes to find my lotion that i had left out 
we did not have the room type that we wanted it said we had a harbor view room and when we arrived our reservation said garden view the front desk agent apologized profusely and she changed it back to what we originally reserved 
upon check out i asked for the hotel managers card so i could call him and explain my concerns i left a message on his voice mail the next day and i still have not heard back i did not want to resort to putting this on here but seeing as no one has contacted me i feel it is my last resort 
it is a shame that we had a bad experience i hope to maybe return one day in the future and have it be like it was every other stay besides the last",1.0
the perfect choice,i find it tough to decide where to stay in a new city especially when we look for someplace reasonably priced the donatello was a perfect choice our corner room was large and clean the location is great loved the club floor terrace and beverages very nice to have a refrigerator and a safe we did not use the dvd player or microwave but had those too every staff member was friendly and helpful we were on the 10th floor and the street noise was loud at night its a big city there is going to be street noise,5.0
the library hotel  perfect location service and features,"i had previously stayed at the related casablanca hotel and thought that was fabulous but the library hotel was even better the location was brilliant the staff were welcoming helpful and very friendly 
the included features computers and printer in business centre breakfast reading room rooftop conservatory and garden tea coffee and snacks library of books and dvds nightly cheese and wine reception were exceptional
i stayed in the smallest room type but was perfectly comfortable and found the room contained all that i needed it couldnt have been cleaner and i loved having a docking station as well as the beautiful library and tv and dvd player",5.0
great time at jw marriott in dc,"my son and i stayed at the jw marriott hotel pennsylvania avenue july 13  16 2006 and had a wonderful stay the lobby was elegant and very clean lots of comfy sofas and chairs to sit and chat or just people watch when we checked in earlier than the 4 pm check in time the desk representative gave my son a sun visor from the fbi and a white house snow globehe was thrilled 
the room was beautiful and newly refurbishedand a plasma tv which my son thought was out of this world room had a view of the washington monument and if you looked to the far right you could see the lincoln memorial the beds were doubles but very comfortable especially after a long day walking around the city bathroom is small but completely new and nicely appointed and meticulously clean thick soft terry robes were in the closet and i saw lots of people wearing them back and forth to the pool
the location is greattwo blocks to the white house close to monuments on the mall metro etc 
ate at avenue grille one evening for dinner and once for breakfast buffetfood was very good we also went to ms grille around the corner  yummy food and also corner bakery corner of 14th  f streets
we really enjoyed our stay in washington and would highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay there againand ps im pretty picky when it comes to where i stay ",5.0
not for the working man,"now lets start from the begining when me and family arrived in the valet we were greeted by very nice guys who emptied our luggage from the car while carrying on a nice conversation tip expected so be ready now after check in we made it up to our room and our bags were right behind us different guy another tip when we got in our room the crib we asked for was not there no big deal one call and less than five minutes later another guy was there with the crib again another tip and dont get me wrong it is well deserved but most of the workers expected it and would even linger around until they recieved it i know i sound cheap but i work for a living and every dollar i give to the valet for retrieving my car is taking away from what i can give my kids i would suggest if you drive park in the garage across the street it is 8 a day if u leave it is another 8 but you will be walking most of the time anyway it certainly beats the 32 plus tax for the hotel valet
the rooms were very clean and the turn down service was great just about every night while we were out the turn down service would bring milk on ice and two huge cookies for my kids this hotel is very nice and should commended on their luxurious appeal allthogh they are trying i dont think it is a very kid friendly place i would recommend this hotel to any couple looking for an expensive get awayand i do mean expensive",4.0
monaco rated 1 so we went and were sorry,advice online that monaco is the bestpaid top dollar got a small room with a view of nothing but a brick walled hotel noisy geary street traffic all hours small bathroomnothing special very overrated so sorry to spend all that money many other hotels we visited would be far superior no service at the desk concierge seems like 20 somethings with attitude are running the place,3.0
nice hotel not far from dicks sporting goods,this was a nice hotel and some of the rooms have balconies the staff was very friendly was there for concerts at dicks sporting goods arena and it is not far from the hotel lots of restaurants and convenience stores a short drive away finding the hotel is difficult as you must make a left after passing over the road leading back to the highway it is easy to mess this up,4.0
multiday stay in fort worth,"we stayed at the hyatt place fort worth cityview in early june 2009 for five nights the hotel has the standard hyatt place brand setup and amenities after staying in different hotels in and near fort worth over the past few years we chose this hotel based on the hyatt brand which we prefer and the hotels general location the hotel is conveniently located off of i20 near several shopping centers and restaurants it is very convenient for accessing tcu which was our primary destination each morning it is a quick and easy 10 minutes drive to the campus 
overall the stay was nice the hotel was very quiet the room size is standard compared to other hyatt place locations with plenty of space for luggage and for relaxing the room has plenty of electrical outlets for charging electronic equipment staff members were very pleasant and always greeted us upon arrival the selfserve kitchen was well stocked with cereals yogurts and juices each morning 
parking is sufficient but not covered and the area around the hotel is fenced off and separated from the shopping area and restaurants exiting the hotel parking lot requires caution it is difficult to see crosstraffic as you leave and incoming traffic is typically traveling at fairly fast speeds dont make the mistake of pulling out too far or without looking 
the quality of cleaning was lacking the floors were not cleaned and used glasses were never replaced despite placing them in obvious locations to indicate they had been used the television channel selection is somewhat lacking particular for children ceiling in the bathroom is low particularly when you are in the shower if you are over 64 you will be hitting your head be sure to duck 
overall we were pleased with this hotel the cleaning was the biggest disappointment however the hotel is quiet and very conveniently located particularly if you are commuting to tcu given the lack of decent options within this area of fort worth we would recommend this hotel and will likely stay again",4.0

its a sheraton what more do you need,"stayed at the sheraton boston for a precruise hotel in october 2009 previously we had booked a hotel in cambridge but after a colleague noted how far from town that was so off to priceline to see if we could snag another hotel this one came up at an attractive rate so we booked it
we were not disappointed its centrally located and attached to one of the malls downtown
you have to realize this is a huge hotel lots of people coming and going 
even though we booked with priceline this hotel put us into a sheraton rewards room  very nice customer service 
the one beef i have with all sheraton hotels is their insistence in charging for wifi the lobby was packed with people because that was the only space in the hotel where the wifi was free why not have it free in all the rooms now i posted something similar about a recent stay in waikiki are they listening
rooms are spacious bathroom spacious view of the charles river was awesome
would we stay at this hotel again possibly but only for a stopover similar to this stay",4.0
great stay at the millennium hilton,"my mom and i really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the room was clean and very comfortable we didnt hear any streetconstruction noise from our room on the 12th floor the hotel was very accommodating and gave us a room with 2 double beds even though we had booked a king through priceline the room was quite large by nyc standards 
its very accessible by public transportation and very easy to get to via train from newark airport also you are able to print your boarding pass from the lobby which is a big plus",5.0
room with a view only on standing,the upholstery was shabby it didnt feel as if it was a 4star hotel the windows were so high that u could not look out if u sat on the bed or on the single dirty chair we requested 4 a room with a good view but the staff refused flatly saying they had no 2 doublebedded rooms with good views but i found my room with wonderful views of the river as well as empire state building very strange attitude of the staff  how long can one stand and admire the view since the hotel is undergoing renovations i suggest they seriously consider increasing the window size so that one gets a good view without having to stand  this is the only good thing about the hotel after i complained that the hotel was not upto the mark they sent a microwave and a fridge to my room normally i think they charge extra 4 the microwave in the mornings theres a hotdog van down at the entrance which has good bagels and coffee at the next street are numerous places serving lovely food taxi takes about 57 to times square or u can walk it no free wifi either,3.0
beautiful and reasonably priced,decided to visit the windy city for a 3night endofsummer treat with our college bound sons found the willows on line and it was just as lovely as the pictures had shown rooms are very affordable had to rent two and the location was quite picturesque quaint chicago neighborhood very quiet and away from downtown hysteria still had plenty of stores and eateries just around the corner breakfast included with stay afternoon sweets and best of all a daily complimentary pass to ballys fitness just around the corner wine available in your room for only 15 a bottle and snacks for just a buck this place is a terrific find will definitely be back,5.0
good downtown location,there for several days on business the staff was excellant the rooms were comfortable they serve breakfast each morning and dinner monthursday it is all free and nice when you are looking to save money although you will want to get out for dinner at one of the many good places nearby it is near the bay and easy walk you dont want to go to far off the beaten path though the inner city of baltimore is really really bad i could not get over the terrible living conditions with abandoned buildings and people lotering again though you will be fine in the area of the hotel if you get a chance dc is only 40 minutes away you can drive up there for early dinner and walk the main parts and be back in no time beds were comfortable and all rooms are suites with kicthens sofa desk etc free wifi there is a awesome gym that guests can use in the building parking is valet 32night or self park 22night the self park though is per inout i highly recommend spending the extra 10 per night it is a lot safer and much more convieint,4.0

service that easily beats a four seasons or ritz and a beautiful property to boot,"spectacular property  lush comfortable sprawling wellmaintained comfortable inviting we had a standard fairway room which was enormous bathroom is very grand beds were super comfortable housekeeping did an outstanding job and remembered all sorts of little details such as what time of evening my husband likes to have a bucket of ice in the room the hotel was also superb with our 3 12 year old giving her a present from a toy box when we checked in and then there were items waiting for her in the room the restaurants also have good childrens menus we only ate at amaya several breakfasts plus one lunch and it was excellent fresh good food and great service 
but what really stood out the most for us was the level of service provided by every single member of the staff here they are trained exceptionally well and really they could teach other luxury hotels a few things about service the valets produced our car in record time offered us directions wherever we were going plus bottles of water the concierges were also exceptionally helpful and just every time you interacted with someone they really went out of their way to welcome you and attend to whatever it was you needed an outstanding hotel

a very nice hotel with a great location,"we recently stayed at the grand hyatt in san francisco for a four day weekend getaway i was quite pleased with most aspects of the hotel although it is showing signs of wear and could use a bit of freshening up we stayed on the 33rd floor in a club king room with access to the club lounge on the 32nd floor our room was small but very clean and the comfortable and the view was fantastic access to the club lounge brings with it a contintental breakfast afternoon snacks and evening desserts sodas bottled water and sparkling water is available from 6 am to 9 pm at no additional cost there is also a computer with printer available for use at no fee the view from the lounge is also fantastic with a clear view of the bay
the staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful we did not try the restaurant or lounge on the 36th floor but i would definitely stay there again its location is perfect for access to chinatown nob hill nearby shopping market street restaurants etc",4.0
bed bugs poor response killed this otherwise great hotel,"this used to be my favorite hotel in the cityin midtown next to subway and a supermarket plus the best hilton diamond breakfast in the chain and all at a reasonable price it was all ruined when i received the most callous and poor service after being bitten all over my bed bugs the infestation was awful but the hotel first tried to make me prove that it happened there and then only offered an apology no offers on how to properly clean my clothes to take care of any medical expensesnot even an offer to discount the room the superviser said i would have to take it up with hotel administration only after contacting hilton hhonors customer service did i receive a response from the hotelan offer to send a discount certificate on a future stay really incidentally it still hasnt come
needless to stay not only will i never stay there again but i actively encourage others not too",2.0
hotel was nice but service noooottttt,we really enjoyed the room and what the city had to offer the people we found to be sort of rude be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for parking the parking rates are ambiguous and if you try to talk to the person in charge be careful we learned that she gets crabby if you wake her up reading terminal market was awesome try the crepe place it was very good,3.0

find a better hotel for the money,"i live in the boston area and stayed at the westin for a quick lastminute getaway we paid 479 for a riverview deluxe room and im so sorry we did the room was incredibly ordinary although the view across rooftops to the charles was nice it wasnt worth the money
the shower was good but the tub didnt drain the climate control didnt work properly we were hot and the bathroom was small  needing renovation and new grout the beds were very comfy the location is excellent  attached to the shopping centers the oddlyshaped and dark lobby was always crowded with conventiongoers and business people overall this is a business hotel and wildly overpriced 
youd do much better across the street at the copley plaza where for a little less money you get much more style and grandeur or for the same price choose the ritz carlton or four seasons a few blocks away but much nicer and on the park
my favorite hotel rooms in boston are the harbor view rooms at the boston harbor hotel at rowes wharf those rooms are plush gorgeous updated and have amazing views the hotel is much friendlier and serviceoriented its just a short walk from there to quincy market copley or downtown
i would not stay at the westin again",2.0
good hotel in great location,this is the second time weve stayed at the soho grand both times for long weekends in new york i love the location right on the doorstep of sohos fabulous shopping district the staff are slightly aloof but friendly enough the service in the overpriced restaurant is inexplicably slow but for location it cant be beaten ask for a room on a high floor  we asked for a room with a view and ended up on the 16th floor with a breathtaking view of the cast iron district with the empire state building in the distance the place could do with a lick of paint but when youre chilling in the bar with a cocktail and peoplewatching you can forgive the soho grands minor faults,5.0
wait until theyre done remodeling,major renovationconstruction a serious issue fair location new heatac unit not yet hooked up one major positive james the shuttle driver took my buddies and i to the columbus crew game right to the entrance and was there waiting when the game got over on the way back we asked for recommendations of where to go for drinks and bar hopping and he even took us there families and anyone not willing to put up with some hassles would be disappointed at least until the construction is completed,2.0
unbelievably bad,my daughter and i accompanied my husband for a business trip and a stay at this hotel in early october how could we go wrong at a sheraton we were in a newly renovated room which was the only savior for this experience judging from some of the previous reviews checked in with 3 towel sets in the bathroom two queen beds no two full size beds i had to call on 3rd day of our visit to please have dry clean towels delivered to our room with three adults showering daily really and while a watermain break did occur on our stay maybe some free bottled water outside our door would have been in line rather than a note under our door saying we could go to the lobby for a cocktail glass of water great for brushing your teeth our tubshower would not drain had to call for that to be fixed made us wonder how they cleaned the shower before we got there our beds were made once our whole stay trashcans in our room never emptied until we called to complain about the towel situation the keycards were not working for the parking lot even though we had them replaced  the valet service on the intercom service for the parking lots very rude for the most part not once was the parking lot issue ever handled the same way twice we complained about the valet service to front desk and were told that they were not part of the sheraton that they were contracted workers we were charged 11 for minibar bottle of water after a hotel employee told us they were complementary of course she told us that after the watermain break was fixed front desk had a real issue with refunding that charge made us wonder how many people even notice minibar charges while there was incredible heat in san diego that week the air conditioner was not able to handle it my only bright spot in our five days were the morning harbor walks and our waiter at the restaurant for breakfast one day his name was john absolutely wonderful i was terribly shocked and surprised with our experience never again,2.0

great stay great hotel,our first visit to the san francisco was accentuated by the terrific accomodations service and extremely helpful staff at the four seasons hotel from checkin to checkout we could not have asked for a better experience we will be back,5.0
terrific location and price,i selected this hotel because of the great reviews from tripadvisor we stayed there for 4 nights and the location was great you could walk to fishermans wharf lombard street etc but you are also close to public transportation you could rent your bike to ride the golden gate bridge right next to hotel you could hop on a bus right at hotel you could walk one block and catch a cable car we needed a car since we were going to yosemite for 2 days and we didnt have to pay to park the car like many hotels our room faced columbus and we had no problem sleeping at night it even had a little balcony the room was updated as other people have said the website does not do the hotel justice extremely affordable and very nice and clean,5.0
genuine hospitality  great service in a good location,"stayed at the chelsea pines in january for 5 nights on my first trip to ny booked on the basis of previous trip advisor reports as did not want to stay in a larger and probably higher graded but probably characterless hotel in mid town nothing fancy but rooms clean and bathroom spotless and efficient 
great help yourself breakfast with gigantic bagels coffee cereal fruit and more to start the day lots of little touches that make a big difference nothing was too much trouble for the staff from the owner down to the kitchen assistant and everyone had a genuine smile for you 
location is good and although there is a subway stop only yards away  we walked everywhere if anyone says to you that new yorkers are abrupt and rude this place is the antidote",4.0
incredible service great hotel,all the good reviews of the ames that i read on tripadvisor were accurate i thoroughly enjoyed the weekend there  very comfortable the staff  including nina sweet the manager who was very responsive  were all extremely friendly and helpful a really great place to stay in boston  i highly recommend it,5.0
exquisite experience friendliest staff in the hotel world,"i have been coming to the sls for several months now i have received nothing but the best regarding service and hospitatlity you have some top notch employees including ashley and lewis at the front desk stephanie and irene in the restaurantlounge jacob and the entire wait staff 
it has been a true pleasure to be a guest at the sls",5.0
no surprises  a pleasant surprise for a family vacation,"travelling with kids a hotel with a pool was the key consideration in our decision to pick this holiday inn midtown 
it was the only only hotel in our price range with a decent sized pool in the area we wanted to stay that the pool shut down at 6 pm was a bit disappointing but not the end of the world  there is more than enough to do in manhattan for those looking for a manhattan hotel with a pool it is important to note that the outdoor pool is seasonal  it is only open in the summer
needing a hotel room for a week long vacation in new york we chose this hotel we were not disappointed it was well located and despite being tired as some of the other reviews note well kept up and clean
and the rooms are big for new york  at least at this price we had a room with two double beds two adults two kids two days of shopping and all of the stuff that that entails it was the size of a standard hotel room in places where space is not at a price premium or even a bit bigger 
the staff was tremendously helpful  a plumbing issue in the bathroom was fixed promptly the concierge provided good recommendations for meals and advice on airport transfers that would be cheaper and more convenient than a yellow taxi
the only disappointment was the restaurant breakfast we did not have other meals in the hotel but it was still adequate  although three of four dirty juice glasses on the table left an impression that the restaurants management was not really focussed on details 
but that should not really be a concern  there are so many delis and restaurants around the hotel that decent meals can be had quickly at a good price within a very few blocks of the hotel",5.0
nightmare at the cliff inn,i would not recommend this hotel our nightmare started right at check in check in is at 300pm we arrived at 350pm we were told our rooms were not ready and that we had to wait 45 minutes we waited over 2 12 hours before we got the keys to both rooms we booked 20 rooms at the hotel for a wedding some of the guest arrived two nights before the wedding and were given dirty room the beds were unmade and the towels were dirty other guests complained that the beds did not have sheets no hot water the rooms smelled bad electrical outlets did not work and no towels were provided the rooms were not cleaned during our entire stay even after requesting several times that they be cleaned the manager allen offered to give us an additional discount of 1000 per night but at check out time we were charged the regular price and he refused to talk to us or come out of his room some guests had to insist for discount and finally got it he made his clerk do all the dirty work for him the wedding reception also had problems the chocolate fountain wasnt a fountain it was a crock pot with hersheys chocolate syrup our kegs of bud light were actually mgd light the dirty dishes were not picked up from our tables we had to do that our selves and there is a strong possibility that allens friends helped themselves to our buffet this hotel is old but it is management with their lack of courtesy and concern of sanitary conditions that make this hotel a nightmare,1.0
worst hotel stay in 20 years of traveling,i spent three nighs at this hotel in may 2004 and would not stay at the regency again under any cicumstances i was scheduled to arrive near midnight so i made a point of calling the hotel at 6 pm to confirm my room  even though i had a guaranteed reservation which had already been charged to my credit card i was assured that he room would be waiting for me upon arrival when i got to the hotel actually an hour ahead of schedule i found 5 or 6 irate guests in the lobbyand i quickly found out why my room had been given away just as theirs had the hotel had given our guaranteed and confirmed reservations to other peoplewhile still being all too happy to charge me the exorbitant rate of 900night in advance for a room they were not giving me due to citywide high occupancy they were unable to find me a room anywhere else in manhattan or even as far away as laguardia the result i spent ove an hour in their lobby at which time the night manager gave up and offered to give me a cot in a meeting room and for all this what compensation did the hotel offer me a free breakfast their conduct was unprofessional and offensive and i would never go back unde any circumstances stay here at your own risk,1.0
fantastic weekend stay,my second stay at the w hollywood  just as great as the first was there for the weekend and true to form the part was going strong come for the fun on the weekend especially the rooftop pool party but hang around for a couple of weekdays when the pace slows down a little and youll have more time to take in the fantastic rooftop views and hike the adjacent hollywood hills highly recommended,5.0
good stay close to airport,clean room relatively quiet for so close to the highway close to airport decent continental breakfast bar w waffle machine my diets downfall,5.0
will definitely go back,"after reading reviews on this site we opted for ink48 for our most recent new york stay this is the best hotel ive stayed in new york we arrived a bit late and were disappointed to learn that the only room available was on a lower floor when we requested a deluxe room on a higher floor our host jay promised that it would only be for the one night and the next day we were moved to an amazing room on the top floor with floor to ceiling views of the hudson river and midtown manhattan
everything about this hotel was perfect personalized friendly service great food complimentary wine and beer during the daily happy hour the location is also fantastic far enough away from the touristy time square but 1015 minutes away for the major attractions",5.0
excellent staff great hotel,"i had been in the la area for 3 weeks and stayed at 4 different hotels this was the best i moved from the holiday inn next door because the tv in my bedroom didnt work and they didnt seem to know how to handle that 
the minute i pulled up to the valet i felt welcome and important the check incheck out process was great the room was better than the marriott renaissance i stayed at in long beach the next day 
very clean and well managed hotel",5.0
a great fit for everyone,we just finished a family reunion that included 58 people from 6 months to 82 years young from beijing vermont illinois colorado and montana experienced to inexperienced travellers who stay at 5 star resorts your and elder hostels or go on safari this was truly an excellent experience for all attending all were very impressed with the caliber of product and service offered clearly there is a cohesive dedicated staff and it is apparent from precheckin to departure we look forward to staying with you again,5.0
much ado about very little,what can i say for graduation weekend this is unfortunately the only game in town staying in philadelphia proper is too far away due to traffic and to get to upenn graduation sites quickly this is the hotel to choose but thats the only reason during graduation week the hotel doubles its prices this is a complete ripoff the rooms are smallish and while the beds are good to sleep in the wood frames have sharp corners that are unfortunately very hard to avoid and painful to encounter the closets are tiny and about four hangers are provided the bathrooms we had a king bed room which had a large shower the door only opened out so that after leaving the shower the bathroom floor flooded with water dripping down the door we changed to a room with a tubshower but those rooms do not have king beds there is only one sink worst of all the walls are thin as paper the entertainment is constant we were treated to the sounds of our neighbors talking on the phone using the bathroom having friends over till late at night fighting making upand the only thing we were not treated to were the sounds of silence parking costs 39 per night our car is parked on the street outside of the hotel yes we are still here while i am writing this we are told that there is security watching the cars right the housekeeping has been good on some days and for the past two days has been lousy i hate having to call up for missing items and then having to tip the person bringing those items when they should have been in the room in the first place breakfast at 40pp has been decent but not worth the price thank goodness our son graduated this is not a hotel we would ever stay at again give me the rittenhouse any day even if it is not near the university and if only they had had rooms available oh and by the way that ipad nothing but a useless gimmick,3.0

location location location,its like the real estate people say  location really does matter if youre into theater this place this perfect only about 1015 minutes walk from the theater district but thankfully away from the madness of times square just a block from grand central meaning lots of subway connections right off of fifth avenue    i mean what else can you ask whats more  given nyc prices and the neighborhood  it was fairly priced clean comfortable good service all that,5.0
disappointing end to a great stay,"i would agree with most of the comments here nice brand new hotel very nice roomsdecor great location staff at check in very friendly and welcoming my problem occurred after checking out when i went to pick up my car at the recommended lot despite my reservation confirmation which indicated a reduced parking fee of 30 and the website which says parking is 30 the garage charged me 40 they said my car was oversized i went back to the hotel to question it and alex at the desk said we have no control over what the garage does although i might disagree with that notion i did not argue just asked that a manager call me the next day it took a call to holiday inn guest relations 2 days later before i received a call from the hotel management i explained the situation and received the same response that alex gave we have no control over what the garage does in addition i was told that you would pay much more if we didnt negotiate a discounted rate no apology for any misunderstanding no apology for the website being inaccurate 
honestly not looking for 10 not looking for anything but confirmation that the garage was not gouging or acknowledgement that the hotel information should be more accurate i simply said that the website and confirmation should be accurate if you charge more for over size vehicles just have the website say it the manager did not say well address that he said well look into it 
on sunday upon check out i didnt know if the garage was ripping me off for 10 the good news is they were not the bad news is as a well located hotel in nyc i was left with the feeling that this hotel doesnt care about loyal holiday inn guests i am a gold priority club member",4.0
despite the great location starwood should be embarrassed to call this a starwood room,i guess i cant complain too much becaues i got this hotel from priceline but i did ay 160 for it and i checked the 35 star box and i can confidently say that the room was not a 35 star room the location is fabulous the arlington station is right across the street which was a quick ride to the garden and we were able to walk to fenway its also close to newbury and several great restaurants the lobby is very nice my issue is with the room itself which was smaller than any room ive ever seen including nyc hotel rooms and looked like it had not been touched in decades the room was very dark minimal sunlight the queensize bed and small desk took up pretty much the entire room the bathroom was tiny my husband and i could not even brush our teeth at the same time there are a lot of hotels nearby weve stayed at the sheraton before which is much nicer so if you are planning a trip to boston id suggest you skip the boston park plaza,2.0
what you miss in the room you make up in location and property,the location couldnt be betterone block from pacific beach steps from the bay and a more quiet beach the amenities on the property were greatfree game room pool great science camp for the kids grassy area beach area boat rides bikes friendly talking birds the rooms could have been much better thoughthe furnishings and linens were old and dark and the bedspread was used too many times its unlikely youll spend much time in your room but this part needs improvement overall we were happy with our experience and would return,4.0
nice furnishings  great location,"fairmont chicago
thanks to a late travelzoo deal the fairmont chicago had the best rate i could find for the weekend the lobby tries to promote luxury and the room was nice but it was nothing head and shoulders above the competition it served just as our home base for 48 hours
comfortable bed enough room to lounge around 42 flat screen tv with lodgenet so you can connect to wifi and then control your tv from your mobile device instead of a dirty remote android iphone the best part about the hotel was definitely its location it was a block from wacker drive which runs along the chicago river and was basically within a mile of everything we wanted to see other chain hotels in the area were the hyatt regency radisson blu sheraton and intercontinental i would just book the one with the best rate
the only negative of our room at the fairmont was the poorly designed bathroom it had a walkin shower in the corner that was undersized along with a separate tub and separate toilet room that was small as well

seattle marriott a very nice hotel,my husband and i stayed here dec 25  26 and thought it was a very nice hotel got a great rate of only 89 through the seattle visitors burueau site and their super saver rateswe had a waterfront room the room was large and the bed was so comfortable highend bedding there was also a nice comfy chair and ottoman in the room everyone on the staff from the bellmen to the valets to the front desk were beyond courteousvery freindly and helpful 25 was a lot to pay for parking but with the low hotel rate it worked out ok finally the location cant be beat as it is within walking distance to the waterfront the ferries the football and baseball stadiums and great areas to explore like pioneer square and the public market,5.0
love this hotel,was so glad to have gotten this place so beautiful n loved the area as well will stay here again if in townbreakfast was efficient and service was great they offered us an upgrade to our room or free dinner bc they didnt get our rooms ready yet for check inreally impressed with this place n enjoyed our stay,5.0
nice bright alternative to the dim w across the street,"on the previous trip i stayed at the w just across the street their mood lighting was so dim as to be disturbing to me i booked this time at the fairmont for about 10 less per night it was a really nice room with oldschool spacious bathroom but everything beautifully updated clean as can be
the soundproofing is so good that i never heard my neighbors once although the rooms were occupied the staff was courteous
couple things for improvement  i had a hard time findingreaching outlets for my mobile and laptop and the pillows were hard  uncomfortable would have loved a down or downlike cover and pillows
the gym and pool were like a pretty nice health club not just a stuffy room with a few treadmills the pool itself was too warm to really enjoy swimming laps but thats a small thing you can sit by the pool in the glass atrium enjoying the sunshine and can order room service there too
dont miss the belle epicurean the great coffee shop on the street just outside one of the entrances of the hotel homemade croissants and pastries that are really exceptional and a bright happy space 
ill happily stay here again if the location is convenient to my purpose",4.0
excellent service and sharp rooms melissa is super helpful,the bar serves strong drinks and the staff is attentive and helpful classy quiet and well appointed rooms best option in the city,5.0
another great experience,this is the second time ive stayed at the orchard hotel for business in the past 6 months and its been consistently great the rooms are bigger than most in sf and very quiet which i really appreciate the staff is very helpful and friendly and the valet service is quick and convenient ill be staying here again soon,4.0
this hotel has a 5star attitude for a 2star price highly recommended,we just stayed here for the great american beer festival and i have to say it was one of the most pleasant experiences in a hotel ive had first of all there is breakfast every morning not granola no no you get hot courses you get oatmeal you get eggs you get sausage you get waffles its great then mon  thurs you get a cocktail hour of beer and wine and snacks and minidinner in case you dont want to go out but way more better than all of that is dumb me i forgot stuff in the room and i called and it was there they found it and they sent it to me the staff is great so helpful and so unuptight oh and be sure to note that they have a shopping service and it is free all you pay for is the product you want they leave the receipts on the table and the stuff in your fridge if i was running a hotel business this is the way i would run it id really like to hide this place so that i can stay there next year but people that travel to denver a lot should really take note you get a suite we had a one bedroom you get breakfast you get cocktails you get free shopping and you get an honest and responsive hotel staff wow 5 stars from me,5.0
great location for visiting all las attractions,"great hotel with exceptionally friendly helpful staff jeremy joi and chris on the front desk were always happy to help organize things and give advice and the bell boys restaurant and bar staff through to the room maids all worked with a genuine smile we stayed 4 nights
 the rooms are large and tastefully decorated and beautifully presented our daughters20  17 had a superior double room with 2 large twin beds and plenty of room for their 3 suitcases to be spread out and delved into my husband and i had a deluxe king room which was much larger with a sitting areaour rooms were in the main buildingthe beds were really comfortable air con in both rooms really quite and effective on our last day we were able to keep this room for an extra 12 day rate so that we could all shower and change after a day out and do last minute packing before our late evening flight the bathrooms are spacious and kept spotlessly cleanexcellent coffee machine with fresh caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee packs available in the room
 the main bar does excellent bar snacks or you can order off the restaurant menu the restaurant has a good menu and does cook steak properly european style so you can order rare etc i would highly recommend their lobster open ravioli which was superb the hotel restaurant and bar has an excellent system which gives you a breakdown of how much you should pay in tips on each bill if you wish to leave 15 18 or 20 this makes life easy
the construction especially around freeway 405 does affect traffic around the hotel at the moment and indeed all of la but hotel staff and most taxi drivers know their way around and can use back roads to access the hotel easily we found yellow taxis to be cleaner and take better routes back to the hotel than the white and blue taxis some of whose drivers spoke poor english the hotel car will take you or pick you up within 3 miles of the hotel so you can then take a taxi or bus to get to destinations further afield the hotel recommended 2 great restaurants nearby davinos italian and katsuya japanese excellent food at bothsee separate reviewsthe hotel car dropped us off and picked us up from both
the getty museum sits on top of the hill above the hotel and again the hotel car will drop you off and pick you up the museum is outstanding and its current exhibitions of ritts photos and klimt drawings should not be missed
find out about bus routes as they are direct and you can transfer to another route easily rather than using taxis which can get expensive if you are only visiting disneyland you would be better staying on the other side of la this hotel has pick ups for the starline tours which makes life easy
the pool area is lovely if you dont want to walk up there they will take you
if we return to la we will definitely stay at this hotel many thanks to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable and congratulations to the management you have a great team working for you",5.0
love the stanford court,"the renaissance stanford court is absolutely as awesome as all the reviews say it is stayed here for a week with family and loved everything about it first of all great location on nob hill the cable car stops are right outside the hotel door the room rate during our stay was excellent had a nice large double bed room with a nice view bathroom was very roomy spouse is a large marriott rewards point holder so we had access to lounge  which is very nice all of the staff that we met while there was wonderful  very customer oriented again since spouse has marriott points  was eligible for free internet which worked well
if going to san fran  would highly recommend the stanford court  i hope to be able to head back there sometime soon",5.0
a great hotel,we stayed at the clarendon the last two nights of a two week vacationwhat a great place to unwind before coming home this hotel has the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in and the pool is a wonderful escape from the heat the staff was incredibly helpful and friendlythey answered every question we had and gave us great tips on local places to go i wish we lived closer so we could go back soon,5.0
clean and comfy with some noise,"this hotel is clean comfortable and affordable the staff performs good service and met my standards of what an upscale hilton should be 
one complaint is noise one controllable and one uncontrollable the controllable factor was the hall noise i could hear doors closing and conversations fairly clearly in my room the uncontrollable was the jet noise at lax the departures from 10 pm to midnight were audible 
one other issue was the parking the parking fee was 25 per day and layout of the garage required a lot a driving down to lower levels to find a slot",4.0
decor needs updating but clean and comfortable,"my daughter and i stayed at the shraton chicago hotel and towers for two nights  our room had a great view of the navy pier was clean and comfortable but the decor is a bit outdated and in need of some upgrading
i found the staff to be very welcoming and helful the location of the hotel is great for downtown and going to the museums in the city also if you would like to catching a movie in the evening the amc theatre is across the street
i think the bathrooms are a bit on the small side
we got a good deal on our room and i would definately book it again through priceline
i would stay away from room service as it is very expensive and the food quality is just okay
we also found the obel  fox market and cafe which was mentioned in a previous post i highly recommend this place for snacks lunch or dinner my daughter is a student in the city and im sure she will be frequenting this place for special treats",3.0
the beacon hotel  good things sometimes come to the latecomer,"most of the folks at my meeting were booked into the famous madison hotel late registrants were booked into the unknown beacon hotel near scott circle i was happy to be relegated to the beacon 
location on rhode island avenue near scott circle an easy walk to farragut square and dupont circle 
room i was upgraded to a large suite at no extra charge the suite featured a dark interior sitting room with sofa easy chairs and tv a kitchenette with microwave fridge stove a king bed and tube tv in room facing west and a bathroom that was larger than my first apartment the suite was designed for guests in wheelchairs with wide doors and passageways and some adjustments in height of furniture furnishings were functional rather than elegant room was spotless 
service friendly and efficient front desk staff though slightly understaffed at checkout allow a bit of time for vacating staff were happy to offer advice on touring transport and other local lore i did not check out exercise and other commons or the on premises restaurant 
cost my suite at the beacon ran at less than half the price of a small room at the madison",5.0

this hotel lacks character or charm but was fine for our trip not the most exciting hotel in san fran but perfectly acceptable",3.0
reduced to 4 stars,our room was on the 40th floor and had amazing views it was immaculate and incredibly spacious as well totally gorgeous bathroom and courteous staff throughout the hotel we also had a brush with a very famous celebrity in the lobby which was pretty cool this would have been a five star review had it not been for an employee error with our checkout time after advising guest services that we would not be leaving the hotel until past checkout time and being charged extra half the daily rate for 5 hours they deactivated our room keys upon our return to the room with minutes to shower and leave for our next destination we were stalled waiting for security to let us into the room i gave the front desk attendant a chance to apologize for the situation but she chose to blame it on the computer instead,4.0

great location,i stayed at the james in july for a family vacation very nice accommodations the hotel is in a great location i received a great rate through hotwire i believe the hotel can be quite pricey so you may want to try hotwire hotel provides robes turn down service and cookies each evening nice size flat screen tv and bathrooms were very nice as well we enjoyed our experience at this hotel,5.0
older hotel with a few issues,"we stayed here for the la marathon and had a great rate for the price we paid it was a good deal beds were the standard and very comfortable hotel overall is an older hotel and it shows
we were upgraded to a corner room which had a great view unfortuantely it was right by the service elevator which we were told doesnt run after midnight so at 1 am it was still running hmmm
my big gripes relate to parking nightmare would be a good term for 28 you can park in a garage next to the hotel its really for the mall the elevator system that serves that parking garage is by far one of the slowest i have ever seen plan to leave very early to allow time for the elevator which also serves the macys department store when we checked out i had bell services take my luggage down and i drove over to get it valet was packed and just kept yelling at people dont stop with no real guidance on what they wanted you to do finally i pulled around the corner and went back to get my luggage which was sitting unattended i picked it up and loaded it myself i didnt mind loading the luggage myself but honestly anyone could have walked of with my stuff which included a computer bag not good imho 
if i get the 139 rate again i will be back but if not there are a lot better choices in the downtown area",3.0

red lion offers quality service,"i stayed here one night and found the shuttle service and front desk staff to be helpful the room had a fan and heat control which i put into use a midnight since it was cold in this room it did warm up and the morning wake up call got me on the shuttle back to the airport on time i returned and stayed two more nights i liked the complimentary wifi and business center with printer also there is a kiosk to check in to alaska air and print a boarding pass right in the entryway the staff were friendly and the new club offers points and airline miles for your stay
i would return here coffee and iron are in the room tv channel selection is limited with no movies restaurant is a short walk and breakfast buffet is available at reduced price",4.0
great little hotel,"we just got back from our trip to new york where we stayed at the pod hotel after reading these reviews i was expecting a little room and that is exactly what we got it was a great little room though and all we needed  it was really clean and new and the bed was comfortable the only bad thing was that you can really hear other people on the first night we could hear everything the girls next door where talking about still we picked up some earplugs at the chemist the next day and slept very well for the next two nights we had a double room with our own bathroom which had a great shower the one thing i would say is that we could not find any air conditioning for the room in a guide book it said the hotel did have it but not sure if it does or not and because it was very warm over the weekend the room was hot during the day i should think in the summer time it might be quite sticky
the hotel is very well located within easy reach of all the mid town attractions with bloomingdales fifth avenue and central park within easy reach macys is a bit further along but still within walking distance as is times square there is a subway just up the road which takes you all the way downtown so you can see the sights down there such as the statue of liberty and brooklyn bridge
there is some nice little restaurants round the hotel with a mcdonalds and some little delis up the road dont eat in tgi fridays the food is horrible and my other half found a cockroach in his salad
do go to the top of the rock at the rockefeller centre we went to both top of the rock and the empire state building but i thought that the top of the rock was by far the best for the views we went in the evening and didnt have to queue at all
if you fancy going to the statue of liberty and you want to go inside the statue it is best to book your tickets online otherwise the likelyhood is you wont get tickets to go inside and climb up is free but tickets are limited and most people book them up if you just fancy going to liberty island and having a look then you dont need to book in advance and can just get tickets for the ferry on the day but beware of the queues",4.0

two of the best features are the location and the fact that the room is quiet id definitely stay here again",4.0
7 day family vacation,we arrived back in minnesota after spending 7 nights at the savoy suites the staff are very helpful even for a hick so far away  the location of the savoy is in old georgetown wow  the suite we stayed in was clean comfortable and our home away from home there are several unique and wonderful restaurants in walking distance as well as a well supplied cvs pharmacy and even a playground for those with little kids the complimentry breakfast buffet with the room was a delight for my 11 yr old son having on site laundry facilities was also a plus if i ever return to washington dc this is the only place i would consider staying at,4.0
well satisfied,within the midprice range i stick to this is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in the washington area the bed was comfortable the location quiet and convenient and the room clean and attractive i also appreciated that the drapes when drawn effectively block out the daylight which enabled me to sleep in late the dinner i had there was surprisingly good and reasonably priced a small disappointment is that they appear to have room service only in the evening for breakfast you have to go downstairs,5.0
an unexpected find,"we were delighted with hotel belleclaire the staff was welcoming informed and available the beds were superb and the location is terrific with bus and subway stops very closeby

we will definitely return",5.0
the lombardy is fabulous,it is my understanding from speaking with the staff that this was once a fine residential hotel now it is mostly a coop hotel where shareholders own the individual rooms and decorate them to their liking they all come with a little kitchenette complete with small frig microwave coffee maker and hair blow dryer the hotel supplies the sheets towels toiletries and housekeeping i had never heard of this place before booking four rooms here for a family get together each room was very unique in their own way and one was more beautiful than the next i found the rooms to be very large very clean very comfortable and quiet i love that they double sheet the beds  a big thing for me with hotels it is in a great midtown location i highly recommend it and look forward to my next visit,5.0
charged twice for the room and are not returning my emails,stayed here for 3 nights first night on 7th floor was terrible due to a very noisy family staying right next door  the kids kept banging on the connecting door screaming and running around until late next morning i asked reception if we could move to another room and she said it was fine  our next room would be ready by the time we came back in the afternoon came back a few hours later picked up our new keys for the 9th floor and went to get our bags turns out reception already allocated us another room 23rd floor and moved our bags there so went back down to reception to get the new keys rest of the stay was great  room was good and clean quiet fantastic location good size got home a couple of weeks later and saw that they charged me for 2 rooms for the duration of my stay emailed back and forth arguing that we only booked one room and they probably got confused because we changed rooms etc but they have since stopped replying to my refund requests and emails so had to start a chargeback process with my credit card provider to get my money back i still dont know why they charged us for 2 rooms seeing as the reservation was under my name but they claim the second room was under my partners name who didnt book anything or sign anything very sour note to the end of what was a great stay if management is reading this  please sort out my refund asap,1.0

wonderful hotel with a great airport location,"my husband and i stayed here the night before our alaska cruise we arrived into the airport collected our luggage and proceeded outside to the vanshuttle area there is a wall of phones and i dialed the radisson and they sent someone out with a van we waited about 5 minutes and never saw the van so i called again and she said he would be right there and asked us where we were standing 10 minutes later the van arrived loaded the luggage and headed to the hotel by the way it is a free shuttle the hotel is literally right across the street from the main entrance to the airport so it is about the closest you can get our room was not ready when we arrived at noon so they kept our bags for us and we walked a few blocks down to a restaurant called sharps which was a bbq style restaurant it was delicious we called the hotel and at about 130 our room was ready we booked a king room in addition to the bed there was a desk and small sitting area and the bathroom was pretty big everything was super clean i loved the sleep number bed the wifi was free in our room the hotel was about 3 blocks from the light rail and we walked there and purchased rail tickets downtown which was about a 40 minute ride when we came back we bought drinks in the lobby which i just loved it was very nice with couches and a fireplace and you just felt like you were at a friends house having a drink the bar tender poured a very good vodka and cranberry and we sat there and chilled out and watched tv for a while before heading up to bed we had breakfast coupons and in the morning we headed down to breakfast which was goodeven though there were a ton of people there for cruises we didnt have to wait for a table 
this was a very nice clean hotel with a great location and amenities the pool area was nice and clean and my husband loved the fitness center all of the equipment was brand new state of the art i would recommend this property to anyone staying in the airport area 
it is hard for me to rate this hotel on value as i booked a travel agent rate which was 5900 which is a great value for mebut i think if i had paid full price i would have been satisfied",5.0
great hotel good place for a solo lady traveler,"it was my 2nd trip to the hotel and i was very lucky as the stuff seemed to be hotelier school traniers and they all very good you know the new they try harder smiling
i was happy with my room i had great city view overlooking the resturant next door which

great staff and value,"every time im in boston i stay at this hotel staffs are very friendly minutes away from downtown shuttles run every 15 mins to subway airport and rentals cars
the gym is excellent and up to date
rooms are average and clean noise and vibration from planes taking off can be annoying but tolerable",4.0
hotel is in very bad shape but staff did everything they could,there is no nice way to say it the hotel is in terribly need of repair its old and awesome and has so much potential but it needs works badly we were assigned a room at check in that was just not fit to stay in but upon returning to the front desk and discussing the situation with shawn at the desk he assigned us to a more acceptable room this guy was an amazing member of the staff he was so sincere and so diligent in helping to get us a better room we expressed empathy and even called to check on us i suggest that as your hotel goes through the process of its renovations as it isyou do everything to keep this employee on your staff because just his demeanor with us made everything better one huge negative though is that there are no coffee makers in the room yikeslol,2.0
nice rooms great receptionist bad breakfast,the rooms were very nice and moderately priced the receptionist fannie was extremely friendly very professional and found me the room i asked for the worst part of the stay was the terrible breakfast the oatmeal was premixed and way too soupy recommend instant oatmeal in packets like grits the eggs were severely overcooked and the sausage patties were very undercooked needed to be browned more i know the breakfast is free but i expect better from marriott i would stay again even with the bad breakfast because of the great room great price and staff like ms fannie on the desk,4.0
excellent hotel for the money,"stayed at this hotel on our lst night in seattle clean spacious bedrooms friendly reception staff very good complimentary breakfast great location 2 mins from the airport
all in all a hotel that i can recommend give it a try you will not be disappoijnted",4.0
nice little hotel,my husband and i stayed for five days while vacationing in san antonio overall we really enjoyed the hotel the service was good and the rooms were comfy and attractive the first few days we were there fell during spring break and the hotel was full it was very loud up on the 4th floor where we were  rude people not the fault of the hotel the doors to the rooms were heavy though so when people slammed the doors it made a loud noise the service was great and all the people we encountered were friendly and eager to please the beds were comfy and i liked that they offered firm and soft pillows the breakfast was hot and good the pool was too full so we skipped it we did use the fitness centerit was nice but could have used some weights overall great stay,4.0
new great value hotel recomend it,brand new hotel flat screen tvs new design best price for area cant beat this one i highly recomend it,5.0
great location,my only issue is that there isnt 24 hour room service its so empty there that if u dont eat early you wont be able to eat the front desk will give you menus for places but its not a lot of options we ordered pizza it took over an hour to arrive,4.0
every staff member made you feel welcome,i went to the aorn congress this last week and stayed at the blackstone i purchased my room through priceline so i feel the value was exceptional the room was beautiful with a nice bathroom and rainfall shower the service is what puts this hotel above many others the staff was fantastic i was made to feel welcome and valued as a customer the location is great with most attractions within a 7 cab ride or within walking distance shedd aquarium field museum the planetarium navy pier and the magnificent mile the food at the blackstone was good if not a little expensive i paid 16 for a sandwich via room service but what i got was so big it was lunch and dinner i highly recommend the blackstone when staying in chicago i know i will go back,5.0
roosevelt hotel  great hotel but beware of hidden fees for business travelers,"i was here for a business meetingconvention the hotel its self is beautiful and the staff is helpful  however if you are staying for a convention and have material to store with the bell staff or need it taken from your car to the bell staff or delivered from the bell staff to the ballroom be warned  they charge fees for this
2000 to have the doorman unload your car
1000 to have doorman store your materials with the hotel
1000 to have bell staff deliver your stored material that you already paid for to be stored to a location other than the lobby
all this before a tip is given so its was more like
3000 to have the doorman unload your car
1500 to have doorman store your materials with the hotel
1500 to have bell staff deliver your stored material that you already paid for to be stored to a location other than the lobby
when asked if i could charge this to my room so i can expense it since it was a business trip the answer was no so my question was is this a hotel charge or a staff charge  didnt get a answer
its a lovely hotel  good food and close to everything just beware of the hidden fees",3.0

i do not remember any negativesi chose this stop with some of the negatives on this boardkeeping in mind that this hotel is almost brand newmy first prority being cleanlinessand second free breakfast and receptionbeerwine and fresh chicken parmtasty the free popcorn was a bonusrooms bigvery roomy for the four of usi did not hear any noise around us as we were tired from the car ridepool was open but we did not usenice area to walk aroundi believe there are townhomes located right next doorsecurity for the shopping center was spotted frequentlyas we felt very safe at this locationit was also the only hotel to offer whole milkthanks homewood",5.0
great location,we stayed here for the location close to the walk of fame and located close to everything we wanted to do in the area nice rooms pillows were extremely fluffy breakfast was decent for being free one day sausage the other day bacon great location just two blocks from the walk of fame and a mall is one block away great staff bummer parking is 22 a night,4.0
i heard there was a great pool too bad i couldnt use it,"i loved the room and the bliss bath products were by far the best part of the stay but i was really looking forward to unwinding by the pool when i woke up and was told that there was too long of a wait to be let in if chairs can and in this case should be reserved that is something that should be offered upon checkin if its a hot day 
you go to a hotel to relax and enjoy the amenities not to have to be on a list to sunbathe i would not recommend staying here when its warm out since you cant use the pool",3.0
not a block away but nice,the best western is nice clean and all the staff was very friendly fortunately we enjoy walking because it seems a lot more than 1 12 blocks from the riverwalk i would say it was more like 45 city blocks if money is not an object instead of spending 88 for a very nice place 45 blocks away from the riverwalk i would choose a place like the drury hotel for 139 we walked around the river area a couple times a day and it just would have been a little more convenient you can get a shuttle into town for 80 cents each way for anyone wanting to watch there money best western was very nice,4.0
hyatt hill country resort  spa,i have to start by saying that everyone i talk to love this hotel so when we arrived i expected something amazing and extraordinary to give a background of my family and our traveling it is mostly out of the country so our expectations were high the hotel is nice and e staff just as pleasant as can be the activities scheduled for the children were great and the kids 5  6 loved having things to look forward to the pools and river was nice and the water refreshing the rooms were nice granite bathrooms two beds furnishings were above average i am guessing that to most pete that travel within the state that this is an amazing experience i am used to having a huge pool overlooking a white sandy beach and beautiful blue ocean with never ending space so this hotel facilities felt a little cramped to me the pool and river in surrounded by trees and vegetation native to the state which makes it beautiful at the same time making it feel closed in and small the grounds to the hotel offer many places to take photos whileon vacation,4.0
good location but loud at night,"location is great and reasonably priced stayed on a friday night and room was on the 3rd floor facing the main street theres a couple of bars directly connected to the hotel and this causes a problem on a friday and probably other nights the noise was so loud that i double checked the windows werent open unfortunately they were firmly shut they just didnt provide enough resistance to the jungle that was outside
real shame as the hotel is nicely kitted out i would only recommend that people stay in one of the rooms to the rear of the building which maybe called atrium rooms",2.0
best value with beautiful clean rooms and friendly staff,we stayed at this hotel dec 2011 and had a very nice experience the hotel is brand new very clean everything works and the staff is very friendly the king suite was very big with microwave fridge and a big flat screen tv the great price included a breakfast with so much to choose from a fitness center and even wash machines for guests to use the pool looks very nice but it was a little to cold to try it this time we will be back oh they even have a program to sign up for to get free nights for staying at laquintas this hotel chain sure has changed over the past years,5.0
surprisingly comfortablewould return,i am the type of gal that likes the ritz carlton and four seasons that being said i was very impressed wtih the hyatt place we needed a room for one night prior to an early flight the hyatt place was clean comfortable and a great value the staff was helpful friendly and efficient the room was large spotlessly clean and very comfortable the bathroom was also nicegranite countertops and a good shower it is the best deal going i would definitely stay here again,5.0
great stay at a good price,we stayed at the westin for a conference we had an outstanding view with a nice quiet room we were very surprised at the quality of the room given the price which was much lower other conference hotels the westin is within an easy walk of pikes place the aquarium and shopping it is also near the monorail the staff was very friendly and helpful,5.0
beware of the extra charges,this hotel is just what you pay forcheap but ok for one night of a quick stay  7500 however i was shocked when i learned on checkin that there is a 15night parking fee for an unsecured open parking area on street level  not even a fence to secure the cars parked there thankfully i had a rental car and nothing happened it was incredibly unacceptable that there would even be a fee it would have been better to list the room rate 15 higher with free parking than to put a value on this ammenity this is probably way too much to say about it but its the principle of it,2.0
a great time,family weekend get awaythe customer service was outstanding the property was very well maintained we ate by the pool and had the breakfast buffet the food was great especially the buffet all the food was fresh the kids 8 and 6 loved the pool and the water slide there are lots of pools to choose from and they are all right there together they had a movie by the pool at night but we were all so tired we only saw a little of it and off to bed only con was how large the property is so there is a lot of walking the hallways to the rooms seem to go on for miles we would definitely go back thoughwe all had a great weekend,5.0
the best hotel,"my granddaughter and i stayed at the doubletree metropolitan hotel from june 23 to june 26 and found it to be wonderful we went there as a part of a american girl package
the rooms are great spacious clean comfortable the only problem we had was as to how to work the shower very confusing make sure they show you what to do
the cookies at check in were a hit with the granddaughter soft and warm we stayed on the 11th flood and no outside sounds were noticed the pillows were the best i have ever put my head on and there were four pillows per bed we had two double beds 
they provided a bed for the american girl doll my granddaughter brought with her they also brought a rob but they wanted 4000 for it and we passed on that
be careful about the prices for food it cost me 2000 for a buffet breakfast and 1000 for the granddaughter a little pricey for french toast sausage juice and coffee
the buffet does have a lot of food and it is all tasty but just too expensive the service was excellent and prompt
if it were not so expensive and i could get the same room i would stay there again i think that since we had a package deal that the price was quite high for 4 nights and five days
location is great just a few blocks from 5th avenue st patricks rockafeller center the american girl place park avenue etc 
we took a pedi cab one night when we were very tired and it cost us 1500 for the short rride back to the hotel from 5th and 49th the next night we thought we would do it again but this time they wanted 2500 i said no and told them i would walk rather than pay that much for the ride one of the other pedi cab drivers said he would do it for 1500 and we went with his pedi cab so be careful about the pedi cab charges ask before you get 
in as to how much they will charge you
there is a fromms book not a very big book that has a wonderful map of manhattan that was a great investment for me it has detailed areas and a lot of great ideas there is a fold out map in the inside cover at the back of the book that i relied on while there i copied the are we stayed in and kept it in my purse for a reference really helped me",5.0
great stay,we stayed at the western inn located in old town and we enjoyed our stay very much the services was great and the room were very large the housekeeping did a great job during our 5 day stay at the hotel i would recommend this hotel and i for sure will stay here when we return to san diego in dec,5.0
great stay made evn better by the staff,"hotel shows its age and a little wear but in a good refined way room was small in comparison to some but nicely decorated very clean and updated nice closet space cmpared to most hotel was very crowded but the floors were relatively quiet at night and even during the daytime location is central to convention center and several good local places to eat i recommend thai tanic and safe to walk at night the hotel restaurant 14k has a good menu and wonderful patio seating for people watching make sure to ask your waiter for the bar bites and dessert menus though or you might not see them if you get the chance to try to the lobster bisque or pretzel bread go for it absolutely wonderful
what made this hotel very special to us and ensured our return was the staff starting with the guest services coordinator innocent chesang yes thats his name  he was outstanding the man knows everything there is to know about dc including where to purchase the best cigars stay at this hotel for no other reason than innocent he takes away all anxiety of navigating the city another member of the staff was a wait staff person named marybel another treasure she kept us entertained with her wonderful way with the patrons and the service was impeccable unfortunately i cant remember the name of the young man who checked us in and also engaged us in conversation about the food show we were attending very pleasant and he too went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable if i had to say anything bad about the hotel it would be that the elevators there are several and not much of a wait ever are very small we travel alot with business and if thats the worst i can come up with then its a winner",4.0
awesome concierge,as an underage traveler i realized i made a mistake going to sd due to the fact that gaslamp caters to those 21 it was a rainy weekend so i did not get to enjoy the outside area and to top it off i got into a car accident during my stay the most comforting thing about my trip was the hotel it was very warm welcoming and i spent most of my weekend indoors which was really the highlight of the trip the best part of my stay would probably be joe the concierge we felt that he genuinely cared about our stay and wanted us to have a good time despite what happened if not for joe our trip would have been a total bust i usually dont take time out to write reviews but i feel that he deserves recognition for his personalized service and is the primary reason we will choose to stay at this hotel when we return thank you joe for renewing our trip and for giving us a reason to come back,5.0
good bargainnice location,ive stayed at various places in ny and the riverside is a quaint clean little hotel the double room with shared bath was extremely small but fine for 3 friends looking to hit the town for a weekend the shared bath was clean and perfectly usable for a short stay the location is nice if you want to enjoy the trendy residential area of the upper west side where you can find many cute markets bars shops cafes and restaurants and live amongst new yorkers if you plan to spend a lot of time touring downtown or in midtown plan wisely as the subway trips between those locations and 88th can be a bit long and the cab rides expensive,3.0
good choicegood location,"i stayed for 2 nights on a business trip and was quite satisfied with this old holiday inn albeit with some caveats
i agree that the location cannot be beat the designation financial district doesnt describe how it is right at the border between the financial district chinatown and north beach and easy to walk to anywhere in any of those districts and being just a short stroll from california st youve also got the cable cars up nob hill from which you can transfer easily to fishermans wharf
nice room  the bed was comfortable lots of room to work on the desk the bathroom was pretty decent with nice towels they avoided my favorite peeve of wall paper in the bath not quite attached good but no one greeted me when i pulled up in my car i walked in and checked in no one asked if i needed help with luggage  and i did i got a cart and did it myself which wasnt difficult but was pretty startling for a hilton i didnt have better luck on check out i called the number i was given by the bell hop and no one answered about 15 rings worth so i carried it all down again by myself
the elevators can be very slow and crowded at some times of the day i walked down one morning after a 10 minute wait those guys from n zealand who were trying to check out and had their luggage with them were still waiting up there where i left them
very odd mens room in the conference area only one urinal next to a conference room holding several hundred old guys with weak bladders there was room for more urinals but they only had one whats up with that 
on the lower floors theres quite a bit of noise in the early am when the trucks come to do whatever it is they loudly do so pick an upper floor which has the views anyways
parking is ok and inside but youre in sf so its not very cheap",4.0
great locationgreat hotel your aussie cousins,before leaving australia we researched for a hotel with a central location surrounded by amenities we were not disappointed great hotel with characterexcellent servicereally good breakfast and evening meals served in the restaurant our advice make sure you opt for a queen sizethe doubles are a little smallok for a single person we had a great stay and would not hesitate to revisit next time in san francisco,5.0
hard to find fault with this hotel,"our stay in the drisco was a pleasurable experience everyone was welcoming and friendlyi was impressed that a member of staff made an effort to find me when i recieved an incoming phone call and i was not in my room
praise has to be given to the staff who gave a high cleaning standard in our extremely comfortable accomadationwe had a suite and our son a room we agreed it was the same standard throughout
the continental breakfast was very good and a wine aperitif in the evening was appreciated
credit has to be given on all members of staff for making it such an enjoyable 3 nights stayi would definately use this hotel again",5.0
and then the power went out,the driskill is in a great part of town close to everything the people working there were very friendly the hotel definitely has a texas feel the rooms are on the small side its an older building on our last night at the hotel the power went out from 1am until 815am we were given glow sticks so we could find our way back to the room the next day everything was in disarray from the power outrage regarding anything with computers credit cards needed to be used the old fashion way and there sound system reverted to playing christmas music even though it was the end of january what can you do technology on the weekends the hotel is very close to a street where the university students go to get completely plastered if you have small children they might see some sites they havent seen before,4.0
service was poor and the hotel is showing its age,"i travel to chicago 2 or 3 times a year on a recent 5day4 night visit to chicago i stayed at the allerton for my first time what struck me immediately was that the doorman was more concerned with directing traffic than helping us out of the car and into the hotel it turns out that was the kind of service we would get throughout our stay here are a few of the problems the elevators are very small and very slow when the hotel is full allow 10 minutes to get from the 20th floor to the ground at breakfast in the restaurant the server offered menus but kept suggesting the buffet until we gave in on another morning room service was slow they told me 30 minutes and it took more than 45 twice we had to ask for more towels we never had more than 1 bar of soap no newspapers are available in the hotel they really just failed at all of the little things 
the bartender was very good but he couldnt make up for the rest of the staff 
the first time i was told thanks for staying with us was when the doorman put me in a cab on the way to airport this will be my last stay at the allerton",2.0
great location but needs maintenance,the hote is well located near the space needle and other tourist services room was comfortable but needs some maintenance  torn curtains etc self serve dining arrangements for breakfast or too confined with insufficent space for residents to prepare their breakfast and find free table space would only recommend if available at a special price,3.0
the steinhart was great,my son and i spent 8 days in san francisco in april 2008 for his belated 21st birthday and our stay at the steinhart helped make the trip great we were in room 402 and had plenty of room to spread out and not get in each others way i had my own room and in the evening the living room tranformed into his room by pulling a murphy bed down out of the wall the full kitchen and lay out of the apartment enhanced our entire san francisco experience hotel managment were friendly attentive and helpful san francisco is always a wonderful place to be and the location of the hotel allowed us to walk to many places and the neighborhood it self was enjoyable i would recommend the steinhart to anyone spending more than a week in the san francisco area,5.0
incredible and releaxing stay,stayed at the hilton san diego bayfront for a conference and brought along the girlfriend to make a side vacation of san diego i dont know if there are any bad views in this hotel but our room had an amazing view of the bay the water front parkvillage downtown and the padres ball field the rooms was exceptionally clean and comfortable i only wish that it still had the refrigerator for all the left overs we had from many good meals the hotel staff were suprisingly friendly for such a large and busy place we enjoyed the spa steam bath relaxation rooms and the oil scented couples bath all very relaxing and suprisingly affordable the swimming pool and hot tub area was well maintained and clean with an unfortunate view of ships loading at the dole warehouse food in the resturant downstairs was actually good the 3 times we ate there i did find the gift shop to be very expensive paying nearly 8 for a toothbrush would love to stay here again in the future,5.0
brilliant for a short stay,it would seem a shame to stay here and not pay the extra for the harbor view its absolutely stunning from the lobby or grill you get a good view but from our full 7th floor window it was even better the location is made more fun when you use the water taxis to get back across to the city costs will mount up pretty quickly if you are staying for a long time but we were only there for a day and a half and one night hotel service was poor in the bar but the bell boys were good and looked after our luggage all day after we checked out no problems there when we were staying the small swimming pool was freezing to the point of being useless  hopefully thats fixed now and its not meant to be unheated we enjoyed our brief time here very much in the summer but can see why it may not ideal when the temperature drops the harbor gets too choppy to enjoy the water taxis and the sun isnt there to show boston off at its best,5.0
where is the free wifi,i couldnt wait to find a mcdonalds with free internet to write my review the hotel has a pleasant setting near piestewa peak with beautiful swimming pools and suites with two large screen tvs what is missing free wireless connections in your room a charge is made for the wire connection in the room that is so 20th century when i can get free wifi at mcds or a the sleep inn on scottsdale road with a much lower room rate the other item missing is a free breakfast as provided at embassy suites or at the sleep inn or best westerns the rico grill on the premises has good steaks and garlic mashed potatoes,4.0
superb staff and great location,"stayed at this hotel room for 4 nights and had a pleasant stay this hotel has a superb location with loads of sight seeing and shopping trips within a short walk
slightly disappointed with the standard of the rooms but they were clean and the maid service was good 
staff were very helpful and friendly especially rafael the bell boy and juan carlos who served me every morning at breakfast",4.0
not recommended,the wireless internet for which youre billed 10 bucks a night functioned maybe 40 of the time and in low power at that everytime you call the front desk you got put on hold dont even bother with wakeup calls since they miss them and checking inout takes an eternity was definitely not impressed and will think twice about booking hilton hotels only reason why i stayed past the first night was to attend my conference,1.0
really convenient for the airport and good rooms,this is just the easiest way to catch a morning international flight spend the night have a nice dinner and walk to the plane,4.0
this best western isnt the best,"our room was quite large but there were problems with the service 
after repeated requests to the front desk for bed linens for the pullout 
sofa we finally had to go down to the front desk and get them 
ourselves the tv didnt work although that was fixed the next day the water 
pressure in the shower was poor the continental breakfast buffet was 
adequate and the swimming pool is tiny the hotels best feature is the 
free shuttle service to the inner harbor camden yards etc however 
space on the hourly shuttle is limited so you need to reserve your spot 
as early as possible since the hotel is connected to the baltimore 
travel center formerly known as a bus station there are some 
interesting people wandering around the area you cant beat the price though 
compared to the downtowninner harbor hotels",2.0
great for the price,my daughter stayed here dec 26  30 and really enjoyed it she said the place was very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful to them she was traveling wth a friend and the walked or took the monorail everyone the hotel was in a great location for all the places they wanted to go her only complant was the breakfast was lacking of many choices they booked the hotel at a great rate and it was well worth it,3.0
a great place to stay and play near harbor east,celebrated my husbands birthday with an overnight stay here and dinner at chazz in harbor east and it felt like we had been to the big apple the hotel has a cool boutique feel as soon as you enter the lobby with its contemporary design and clean new vibe our room was huge flat screen tv can be aimed at the unbelievable hot tub jacuzzi your sofa or the ohsocomfy king size bed wow the staff is super friendly youll love it,5.0
great property in perfect location but,"we had an issue at checkin we arrived at the prescribed checkin time and we were told that they did not have a room ready for us they told us it would be less than an hour and they would call our cell when the room was ready even tho wed just driven 2 hours we left our bags with the bellman and went to explore the riverwalk for a whileand the hotel never called over and hour later we went back on our own and they did have our room but had never called for some reason next to us at the counter was a woman whod just driven 7 hours to attend a wedding that night and they did not have her room ready either over 25 hours after scheduled checkin time they did give us a voucher for 30 in drinks at the hotel bar there which was nice they also later slipped an apology note under our door not sure if this is the norm for them or if they were having issues on the holiday weekend but this is a nice large hotel get it together 
after the issue at checkin the room was surprisingly nice we chose a smaller king overlooking the pool rather than a larger king on the street for less noise it was nice to be given a choice the room had cable with showtime but no movies on demand i guess they think the riverwalk is entertainment enough but after everything at checkin and the holiday crowd we just wanted to relax in and watch a flick no such luck they were also out of the champagne we ordered but did sub a nicer bottle for the same price overall this is a nice hotel with its own riverwalk entrance which was great they did work to accommodate us after the snafu at checkin but it was just superficial bandaids  no real apology i would stay here again cuz its nice but for the price it would not be my first choice ",4.0
you will not get enough towels andor wash clothes,so heres the thing one would expect wash clothes and towels to be a basic item you would receive with your room not here every night of our stay we have called for towels to accommodate so far tonightwe have waited over two hoursstill waiting with a promise of towelswash clothes to come maybe by shower time tomorrow we may have them byot,3.0
nice hotel in great location,"went to dc for a conference and a friend told me about the quincy the price was great and the location was fabulous right in the golden triangle the metro stop was just a block away and there are a ton of restaurants and shops all around 
the room was very nice and quite big very nice bathroom and toiletries i was especially happy to find makeup remover towelettes on the vanity  the bed was comfy and they put a ton of pillows on the bed which i enjoy 
i cant finish the review without talking about the staff they were superb so incredibly helpful with everything i have never felt so welcomed at a hotel i would come back just for them",4.0
cleanist friendliest most individualistic and generous hotel ever ,"this is a must stay hotel in san francisco no down sides whatsoever having stayed in many hotels all over the world  this tops the lot  i stayed at the waldorf new york recently and although very grand this is a far better hotel altogether
tip join kimpton intouch which is free to join on kimpton website before you go and get various perks including free in room wifi

fabulous place for kids especially when greeted steve the doorman he is so much more than that always there to lend a hand no matter what you needterry the concierge is fantastic a sorting out your trips and adventurescarmel and monterey trip on greyline tours was amazing  stephanie on the front desk did everything she could to make our stay very special there is no member of staff that would not go out of their way to help you location is fab  so central to everything  
this hotel is totally excellent alllround oh and the wine hour is pretty good too at 5 6pm daily very relaxing and enjoyable after a great day in the city",5.0
good central location for seeing sights,"my son and i stayed at this hotel we found everyone to be friendly and helpful great breakfast buffet included in price we were seated at table and then went up to buffet no hunting for tables
i asked for extra pillows when i booked hotel and they were in our room upon arrival rooms desperately need renovation to freshen things up employee said they are hoping to do that next year great location easy access to main expressways and nearby cities",3.0
fabulous hotel,"lots of negative criticism of the w washington on this site but it must be that i live in some sort of parallel universe as i had a completely different experience which was pretty much first class from beginning to end 
on arrival late on thursday night i was greeted by dag on front reception who booked me in but unfortunately the room chosen for me was a little close to the elevators for my liking so dag changed my room without any problem rooms are quirky with a vanity sink and mirror actually in the room and a semiopaque shower which might not be to everyones liking beds are superb as always so comfortable the walls are a little thin and i accept tv noise and other noise enough said could on occasions be heard but it was never ever intrusive
on the saturday kelsie on the front desk was once again superb arranging a table for 8 at the source at very short notice huge thank you
breakfast in jgs steakhouse was delicious with highly attentive waiting staff i recommend the eggs benedict
the roof top bar pov is a fabulous place for sundowners contrary to previous reports on this site there was never a problem getting in for a drink and im an untrendy 40something on sunday night we were even treated to the sight of marine one helicopter arriving with mr president arriving back at the white house my god the hotel lays on everything 
i didnt try getting into pov late at night so cannot comment as to whether thats a nightmare i know there is a 35 per person charge for a table so they are clearly going for the pretty people but heyho
on checkout i noticed that there was a duplication of an internet fee 1495 come on guys free wifi should be the norm in a hotel of this quality for its guests but it was immediately removed and the bill corrected without any fuss
on the whole however i have no complaints whatsoever i would thoroughly recommend to anyone wanting to get the vibe in dc",5.0
great hotelbut too open too mall,i recently stayed at marriott copley place i like itit they have the best beds i have ever slept on they have a street entrance and a mall entrance this where i get to the part where it is too open to the mall it is so open they have security guards in the atrium there should be a better separation between the hotel and malli ate at conexion in lounge they have the best asian wings in the world i was on the 34 floor i had a amazing view they called it a habor view the harbor was a harbor view the harbor was like 10 miles away the concierge service was not the best on the first day we wanted to go to the uss constitution we need the name of the ferry he told us f4 i found out that is its name on the map as in ferry 4 it was really rookie and rita rookie is one rita is another the boston duck tours broads right across the street from the hotel we had the concierge floor with free breakfast and deserts and appetizers a employee that stood out to me was ashley from the concierge floor she gave me desserts to take homeshe is just one of the best employees i have encountered out of the many hotels ii have stayed at she is the best employe i have met,4.0
comfortable and goodvalue,"we had a great stay here for 10 nights on our honeymoon it had a great vibe i enjoyed the funky looney tunes decor in the heart of times square the inhouse bars were great for a cocktail to begin the night or perhaps a nightcap before bed having a dean and deluca in the building was a huge bonus for our early morning coffee and fresh fruit salad onthego we had unlimited complimentary wifi for our stay which was really handy while the rooms are a bit small thats basically expected across this pricerange in the heart of nyc
while we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves there were some negative aspects that are worthy of mentioning for future potential guests to this hotel
the airconditioning in the room sounded like an aircraft landing on our heads it also seemed as though it only had two temperatures  1 siberian winter and 2 arabian desert we constantly flicked between the two in attempt to set a relatively tolerable room temperature but it made sleeping kind of difficult
while the staff at concierge were friendly we found them to be unhelpful firstly they were very difficult to get a hold of in the lead up to our trip from australia according to our emails we had booked and paid for a shuttle bus to collect us from the airport but when we arrived at the airport in nyc noone came to collect us and we had to arrange our own transport to the hotel not great after 24 hours in transit during our stay we asked the concierge desk about certain restaurants in the area and they didnt offer much information  we found our time out pocket guide to be far more helpful
other than these slight issues we were suitably impressed we would happily recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience the time square energy from comfortable and good value accommodation",4.0
way below omni standards,"if youve stayed at other omni hotels do not except the same quality and service at this hotel the rooms were small outofdate and did not include many of the amenities the hotels site has listed 
disappointed i asked to view the executive king suites not impressive they just added an old loveseat to the room dont waste your money although their web site lists complimentary shuttle dont count on it its actually an airport shuttle 24 fare and if it happens to be around it might be able to take you somewhere the restaurant was nice but way overpriced for this everyday traveler 250 for just a cup of coffee the only thing this hotel has is a good location however within two blocks is the adams mark hotel for about the same price you can stay at this first class hotel instead of the run down omni like i said my past experiences with omni have been superb this hotel just doesnt live up to the omni name",1.0
worth paying a little extra for,"due to the price this is not a property we would have ordinarily considered even with the special deal we got it was still pricy for us but well worth the extra money in all respects
pros 1 location  we had never been to boston and wanted a central location to explore the city with kids there is no better location than this just a few dozen feet from the old state house and the subway station that is located underneath from that station we could go anywhere we needed to go with minimal hassles and delay we were able to conveniently walk the freedom trail and take meals at fanuil hall which is just a block away 2 service  the staff went out of its way to welcome us with young children disregard what you may have read elsewhere all comments about this being a kid unfriendly place the staff was among the most friendly we have encountered anywhere in the world 3 style  ultra hip and supercontemporary not something we usually go for but it was a great change fo pace pretty neat 4 immaculate probably the cleanest property we have ever visited
cons 1 price
this is our first choice next time we go to boston no doubt about it",5.0
rooms are too cold and you cant manage temperature,"cold rooms ac is way too high and there is no way to manage it from the room

great location,"arrived 031212 in new york for my 1st time
hotel was in a great location just a couple of streets away from maceys department store and empire state building also just a 10 minute walk to times square
we had to queue to check in but this is possibly due to being in december there were 4 receptionists so we didnt queue for long 
our room was located on 32nd floor it was a bit small to other hotels ive stayed in it was clean and modern the bathroom could have done with a bit of tlc but you dont go to new york to stay in the room 
attached to the hotel was a diner and a restaurant we ate at both of these and recommend them
if you have never been to new york before the taxis restaurants etc all expect to be tipped and they will ask for one if you dont give it straight away they all put about 15 plus onto your bill
when i go back to new york i will stay at this hotel again",5.0
the palace is truly a palace we felt like royalty,we appreciated the on point service and the quiet reserved atomosphere that allowed us to basically enjoy our time unimpededalso the room service tasted 5 star on the one hand we were able to really relax on the other we didnt get to expierience friscos dining but that is why everyone wants to live in a palace ,4.0
great hotel,great little hotel  clean rooms rocky made the stay worth it all  gave us a plethora of info on what to do in san diego he printed maps  even came around the desk to give us specifics on how to get to places where to park etc he even retrieved me a beverage after the soda machine decided to eat my dollar superb customer service,4.0
best bed in nyc,at the risk of gushing which yes i am this hotel is amazingthe rooms are contemporary and spotlessly clean and although in the heart of the city the rooms are perfectly quiet thanks to the sound proofingi have stayed in some so called luxury hotels with price tag to match but the pearl has far exceeded the standards found in thosefree wifi and breakfast was an absolute findthe staff were very friendly and helpful especially the night staff ali and malbin as im not big on sleep i found myself in the lobby in the early hours and these two gentlemen made me feel very welcome and safeall in all an exceptional hotel in an amazing location at a very fair pricewhen next in ny it will be my first and only choice,5.0
hotel mela is the nicest hotel at the best value in the times square area of nyc,i have stayed at several different hotels in the times square area of nyc and none can beat the hotel mela in terms of design style service and value this was our first stay there and we were not disappointed the staff was amazing and fulfilled our every desire fabulous location,5.0
memphis,went on a long weekend for our 26th anniversary memphis is a city on the decline never been there before looks like a place that once had a lot going for it but no longer we come from ny and we felt this city was very unsafe in the down town area beale st was a great disappointment great potential a lot of great music history but it is all going to get lost in the crime we stayed at the hampton inn there on peabody around the corner from beale st lesson learned many say why get a room that is expensive all you do is sleep there the room can make or break the vacation it was very noisy some of it seemed under construction recommend you spend a few extra and stay at the peabody hotel beautiful place we had dinner there 2 nights visited grace land very nice but growing up with elvis also very sad highly recommend you visit there,2.0
good location and nice hotel,i was impressed with the muse it has a nice restaurantbar in the lobby very trendy in the decorations the location was nice not too far from grand central there is a busshuttle to airports from there i usually wouldnt choose to stay in times square but this hotel was off broadway enough to get away from all of the crowd but had easy access there was some noise coming from the irish bars below if you are going to nyc to see broadway shows and have easy access to all things midtown this is the place my opinion,4.0
great place to stay near times square,"the residence inn is a great place to stay if you want to be near times squarebryant park the rooms are very large by nyc standards and you can request a room with a great view which we did its nice to be in the city and have a couch and small kitchen in your room 
the staff at the hotel is very friendly and helpful and the residence inn has some great features like free wireless internet and a free full breakfast 
my only caution would be that if youre used to staying at the four seasons or the mandarin this may not be the hotel for you the decor is not plush but its still very nice honestly the residence inn was better than a lot of 4 and even 5 star hotels ive stayed at in nyc our room was large clean and had tons of ammenities including a flat screen tv and the bed is very comfortable 
id recommend the residence inn to anyone travelling to nyc especially if you are going to spend a few days there its nice to have the extra room and features that it offers",5.0
affordable and great location,i stayed here when it was jurys and the location was so great i thought i would give it another try this time the rate was amazing through a third party website and when i called the hotel to ask if we could come a night earlier and have the same rate honored they agreed and were very pleasant the room was large clean and quiet the pub downstairs is a great place to meet for a drink the hotel scene in boston isnt that great  the w and nine zero are popular but sparse and poor in service the fairmont copley and park plaza are from another era i would definitely recommend staying here to visitors of any nature,4.0
nice but quirky ending and still no receipt,"stayed in this hotel recently for business and the meeting was held here as well nice modern lobby  good restaurant and small snack shop off the lobby never saw the pool but pictures are nice hotel is right on the water
when i made the reservation was offered a potential upgrade you could choose from several that were offered on line no guarantee you find out at checkin or the day before if you call you can also decline prior to checkin neat concept got a corner room upgrade for 9  well worth it with four large windows great views but a little noisy on the street side room nicely equipped  even had toothpaste and upscale bath toiletries
at checkin was told i had an automatic 2 pm checkout which would work very well for me gave me a chance to go upstairs and change after the meeting and freshen up before starting to drive home 2 hours well  not really headed up to my room at 1130 to use the restroom and my key would not work thought i had the wrong room but another guest answered even though i had the do not disturb insert in the key slot  the maids must have entered the room without consulting the late checkout list saw the room was empty reported it vacated and cleaned it in record time glad i wasnt in the shower really  there wasnt that long between my trips to the room to accomplish all that plus get another person checkin to the room wow when i told the front desk they apologized and offered me another room i declined the new room  thought it was a waste but the whole thing irritated me 
the other quirk is the the statement upon checkin  they ask if you would like your final bill emailed to you this was a new to me so if you say yes you do not get a bill under the door not sure if they do this at all anyway it has been more that 24 hours and i still do not have an invoice  which i need to file my expenses i had to call  they instruct you to go online and through a series of clicks request a copy of your statement  says it can take up to 48 hours normally i would not leave without a bill i guess that was my fault for not getting that when i exited the hotel  was too poed about the room thing
note  wireless internet is not free we selfparked in adjoining garage 30night
all and all  nice hotel great location just be aware of things noted

wonderful stay at intercontinentalboston,great long weekend stay in boston for a wedding central location close to northend downtown markets mta red line stop at south station and surprisingly short walk to boston commons very helpful staff arrived on redeye flight from west coast and staff stored bags and had a room for us by 1100 am honored government per diem rate on busy weekend in boston and still got corner room room faced street which other reviews complain about as loud these fussy business travelers must not stay in the hotels i usually do because the soundproofing was very good with little street noise for a large city bathroom and tv were 5 stars lobby bar lively and hip no hot tub in spa though also room service breakfast was disappointing for price hotel should consider more affordable breakfast buffet for business travelers if you can get a discounted rate this is a great hotel and location for a romantic weekend,5.0
great value for money,this hotel is excellent value for money huge rooms friendly  helpful staff at prices which are good for your pocket no bar in hotel but just around the corner at 906 7th avenue theres an irish pub  pj carneys  which gives huge helpings of foodrelatively cheap steaks  the gaelic burger  buffalo burger are fantastic generous measures of booze served in an atmosphere of the way pubs used to be like in uk years ago everyone is made welcome passing traffic can be a bit noisy but then nowhere in new york can be said to be quiet,4.0
comfortable hotel,"stayed here for a long weekend in may and would recommend the hotel the location is good central for most places and transport links checkin was painless and the guy taking our bags up to the room was polite and courteous and showed us the gadgets of the room and warned us about the silly minibar with its sensor mechanism very handy when travelling with children who may just move things around and you will still get charged for it
the room was nice with a separation between the bedroom and lounge area and the bathroom a good size and powershower 
we did not use the gym or restaurant but did find the starbucks downstairs very helpful for caffeine fixes and it was open quite late too
it is rather a big hotel and whilst we were there lots of conferences going on which made it feel quite businesslike allinall it is a safe bet for a stay in seattle",4.0
location location location,"just back after our extended stay at the hiltonthanks to sandy we had an extra 4 days in the big apple  the hotel and staff and occupants all pulled together thru this 100 year event
we spent a fair bit of time in the hotel especially during the stormservice at the bars was very efficient snacks were tasty and although crowded at times the drinks soon came a bit pricey though 
the room was an adequate size and the beds very comfyjust one minor complaint the toilet flush was under the vanity unit so very difficult to reach 
the position of the hotel is perfectwithin walking distance of everything in midtown manhatten
we didnt have brecky in the hotel so cannot comment on that facility",5.0
luxury hotel at government rate,this is a beautiful property with especially nice bathroom and shower as previously reported the area may someday be developed but it is not yet the nearest restaurant outside of the hotel or starbucks is a long walk the smithsonian is not too far but still 5 miles or more nevertheless the walk was pleasant with cabs readily available when the weather isnt good for walking the staff was almost uniformly friendly and helpful the conference room for our meeting was fine although their internet there and in the rooms could use more bandwidth only other small problem the pillows are not goodlong with too little filling at full price i would not give 5 stars but at the rate we obtained it was a great stay,4.0
a wonderful experience,from the minute i drove up the staff was courteous helpful and on top of things the desk staff charming and the lobby beautiful my room clean quiet and very well appointed the bed super comfortable i stayed in a lux suite and was surprised that the bathroom was quite small shower only which was a disappointment as i had an cold during my travels and really wanted a soak otherwise really really great stay great location an easy walk to most attractions and lola amazing,5.0
horrible experience prepare to be snubbed,"awful experience
at the front desk the staff made a note that we booked on orbitz
this was supposed to be a nice date with my husband and when we arrived at the room it look very used the tv was old and small and also obviously broken when we called about the broken tv they didnt send someone up for over an hour the phone by the bed was also broken there was a large stain by the bed and the bedspread didnt look the cleanest also the front desk clerk forgot to give us the bar key we would have put up with this even though we were surprised at their lack of concern for our experience
we thought we could have a romantic dinner at randolphs the waiter immediately got menus and was going to seat us when the gm came up and said it would be 5 minutes but we could sit in the bar we were dressed casually but not inappropriately we had a beer and waited over 30 minutes the gm obviously aware of us but rushing around it was obvious that they refused to seat us also in the bar was a drunk buch of groomsmen who had awful language and conversation i have never been insulted or snubbed like that in my life we left and decided to check out of the hotel as well the front desk clerk appeared to not even care if we checked out there was no attempt to make our stay positive in the least we will never go there again and you shoudnt either 
we checked in to the embassy suites and had excellent service and friendly staff who cared about our stay",1.0
fantastic unknown hotel room 302 has 74c in prizes," if you are lucky enough to stay in room 302 da vinci hotel new york we have hidden 74c in pennies in the room if you find them you can keep them good luck 
i researched hotels in new york for about 2 weeks leading up to book
for what i wanted to spend i was either looking at something a little better then a hostel then the prices seemed to jump dramatically to hotel prices
i some how stubbled across this place and read many of the reviews after staying there i understand what the negatives are saying but i also wonder what they were expected
this hotel does not have a massive star rating but that should not affect your decision 
new york hotel rooms are going to be small end of story for what you pay here the rooms are a decent size what do you need the extra space for anyway the hotel was a place to sleep and shower thats pretty much it
the desk is attended 247 and the staff were lovely i asked them for directionsadvice a couple of times and they were more then friendly
fyi you pay for the hotel on arrive i knew this and it was no big deal
wifi is included
breakfast is available from 7am till 10pm but you wanna get down there before 9 to get the good stuff 
breakfast isnt anything special but its more then you get at any other hotel without paying its simple there are croissants small muffins and rolls no toaster spreads butter and jams
also a kettle for tea and a coffee machine possibly instant coffee
i got in a routine in the morning of getting up about 7308 walking to starbucks 1 block away and grabbing a croissant for me and a muffin for my girl and taking it back to our room for her breakfast in bed haha
our room
we arrived about 2am in the morning and lucked out and scored room 302 bad room reviews from previous reviews
this room faces the street that you enter off and is 2 levels up so there is a bit of traffic noise dump trucks etc at night and 1 of the nights there were road works outside all night
we use to live on a main road back home so we were able to deal with the city noise but i can understand how others would be annoyed if so you are probably better off with a room with no view who looks out the windows anyway
also room 302 has a resident next door kind of a strange situation i asked about this and apparently he came with the hotel he doesnt make noise and i assume is respectful to guests but seems to be home all day and smokes like a chimney thus the hall way does smell of smoke as soon as you step out the lift
bed was ok nothing amazing i have to agree with previous people the pillow were horrible rather thin and hard 1 pillow wasnt enough 2 was too much and they were very stiff
air con worked fine when required
bathroom was clean shower was good and soaps etc nice
house keeping does come very late some days shouldnt be an issue unless you are hanging around in your room all day they have a little envelope for tips we just put 2 in there each day better then nothing 
 best parts 
hotel is in an amazing location 
work to times square in 10mins rockefeller in 10mins central park in 5 mins best location to see the city we only caught a cab once because it was raining
great price
no bed bugs
clean and friendly

if you like small cramped rooms  this is the place for you,the standard queen at this hotel is equivalent to a closet if you like cruise ship style rooms youll be fine if not and your are claustrophobic this is not the right hotel for you the rooms have a ship nautical theme and the galley thing goes along with it the room i had was nothing more than a closet on the noisy street with a desk the bathroom had no door as it could not open due to the hall from the room door to the bed not having the appropriate width when i called to ask if i could change as i was feeling very claustrophobic i was informed most of the rooms were like this needless to say the rooms that are described and pictured on the hotel website are not what the hotel actually has i have traveled to many countries several times and this is by far the smallest room i have ever been in oh and did i mention it was right next to the service elevator yes it was so we got to hear that until late into the night i wont even mention the street noise and the fact that i had to sleep with ear plugs in oh and one more thingdont be presumptuous and assume you as a client have the right to use the luggage cart if you do you will be accosted by the bellhop with the alien helmet polite not being in his vocabulary all in all i would rate this hotel an overall of a 1,1.0
rapacious staff and management,"the rooms are very nice  and particularly spacious for a nyc hotel beyond the rooms the hotel doesnt have a great deal going for it
some of the staff are pleasant as other reviewers have mentioned some of them are rather selfimportant  for example i was told by vittorio the frontdesk manager that we couldnt move a chair from a colleagues room to my room to hold a meeting because it would make it look untidy
of course new york is expensive but theres a difference between transparent costs and billfiddling check your bills very carefully  wherever possible someone will have added an additional spurious charge  whether bogus items on a drycleaning bill or an extra 170 on an unitemised limo hire",3.0
excellent hotel for early morning flight,"after reading on ta that this hotel had breakfast starting at 4 am  and an airport shuttle it was a nobrainer to make a reservation here the la quinta is on tower road  only a 15 minute ride to the airport we had a 7 am flight and having experienced the security line at dia many other times we wanted to get there early
the room was large and very well appointed the desk and working area was large but the wireless was much slower than were used to front desk staff was very helpful and amazingly patient with some of the guests  not us 
we only had one problem with the room  the bathtub did not drain well while taking showers we ended up standing in about 2 of water by the end reported it to the front desk upon check out so hopefully the next guest wont have the same problem
plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel including a ruby tuesday right next door would definitely stay here again",4.0
great but not for us,"my girlfriend and i stayed at the omni for 3 mights in early january we had mixed reviews of this hotel
this is a very well maintained clean modern hotel it was immaculate the beds are huge and bathroom was amazing
however we were aware that this hotel is chatered towards business stays and that there are a lot of confrences etc at this hotel and is not ideal for tourists which was our reason for stay for a hotel that is based around business people the internet connection and cell reception was terrible we spoke to hotel staff about this and they said yes it is pretty bad at times also another negative was that there was one terrible conierge at this hotel he told us he didnt know the area that well and he also stuffed up a hire car booking we had made thru him however there is a very capable female concierge there whom saved us on a couple of occasions
the location is okay once you figure out where you are and where everything else is but it was daunting at first
overall the hotel is very nice one of the nicest we stayed in but just wasnt for us",3.0
what a great place,i just left the new york palace after spending 10 nights there with my husband and teenage children what a fantastic hotel the rooms are huge the location could not be better but what really takes it above others is the wonderful concierge service there are always enough people manning the concierge desk so its never a long wait they are friendly patient and sent us to great restaurants thanks for making our stay in new york so special well definitely be back,5.0
a great hotel the staff make you feel welcomed,my husband and i stayed here for our 5 year wedding anniversary the room was clean the bathroom was clean the king bed was comfy not like your normal hard hotel bed they have a pool but it is not very deep so it would be great for kids when we come back we would stay here again and bring our kids,5.0
nice hotel but ill try another next time,i stayed for 3 nights with my family wife and 2 boys ages 8 and 6 for a conference in january 2012 the service is what you expect from a ritz carlton elegant and refined but not too intrusive check in and check out very smooth with no wait be aware that if you bring a car you have to valet it and it is pretty expensive each night i didnt bother looking for street or garage parking because of the convenience breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good as was the room service menu options location is nice close to walking distance from chinatown little italy and union square we did have some issue with noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms i guess soundproofing could be better we had a room with double beds on the 5th floor with a view of the transamerica pyramid bathrooms were of decent size the hotel and rooms do seem somewhat old and could use some updating of the decor,4.0
wonderful hotel in a good location,the westin hotel could not have been more accommodating they allowed us both early check in and late check out we were there for a wedding and they helped with several requests for things we needed and made great suggestions for things to do and where to eat the room was extra clean and spacious very comfortable with a lovely view of the river the only criticism is that the lobby is a lilttle dark they need a little better lighting would definitely stay there again as well as recommend it,5.0
special three nite package offseasion,a few years ago we booked a three nite stay in the fairmont in san francisco and it could not get any better for hospitality or accomodations you have to be careful of the  it is definately not a cheap datealthough we were lucky enough to get a fantastic package for the price we always come away from a getaway holiday with some lasting feelings and beleive me this was the top of the line,5.0
fabulous location,"just returned from a 4 night stay at the le meridien in san francisco the hotel was clean the rooms comfortable and the location was fabulous 
the rooms on the small side for 300 but the view was great room 707  a lower floor in this 22 floor beauty and the room had a very functional plan mini bar was not overpriced for sfo
the hotel bar 333  bistro serves a stiff drink and is a great place to relax our friends enjoyed eating in the park grill on the 3rd floor and felt the menu was great the fitness center offers some nice equipment to run on and lift weights 
the location wow a few blocks up hill and you are in chinatown a few blocks to the west and you are at pier 39 and a few blocks to the east and you are shopping at union square dont overlook the embarcadero center across the street which has some great stores and places to eat late night drinks cant be beat right next door at the elephant  castle pub
we did a sonoma wine tour with beau wine tours and it was great we had an 8 person limo for 9 hours for under 1000 with tip and it came with champagne and a knowledgeable driver ask for steve he took us over the golden gate bridge and we stopped for pictures in both directions he recommended the girl  the fig for lunch in sonoma  it was fabulous",5.0
the jwjust wow,"stayed for a gymnastics meet held at the convention center 
when booking you will want to upgrade to the concierge level more on that shortly 
check in was prompt and efficient staff were very helpful hotel layout is fantastic except some of the elevators dont go to some floors so look sharp 
hotel rooms were spacious and clean have everything you would need except for maybe a refrigerator or microwave our shower was greathad three jets and the water was fabulously hot 
there is a starbucks on the second floor a real starbucks not a we serve starbucks 
there are two restaraunts in the hotel i didnt eat at the italian place but it looked rather pricey the sports bar was very upscale and had a good selection of food and drinks at about regular pricing the food there was pretty good 
if you have a chance to upgrade to an executive room or get upgraded you will want to check out the lounge on the 31st floor they have snacks out all day breakfast in the mornings sodas and waters in refrigerators all day and beerwine for purchase in the evenings plenty of tvs and couches for relaxing very comfortable for unwinding 
hotel is centrally located and connected via skywalk to the convention center and other hotels there is a mall in walking distance as well as numerous other restaraunts at all price levels 
they do have a gym and indoor pool gym had ellipticals treadmills machine weights and some free weights was health club quality for sure and they have chilled wet towels for cooling off if one might need that in indianapolis in the winter 
in closing this was perhaps the best hotel i have ever stayed at very clean very upscale if i could choose one hotel to live in this would probably be it very impressed and glad we stayed",5.0
great for 2 people,"my father and i just returned from a trip to nyc and were very pleased with our stay the room was clean nicely furnished and had all the aminities advertiesed if i ever go on vacation in nyc this is the hotel for me i would however not recommend this hotel for a family however it is a great place for 2 people or a couple i was very satisfied

beautiful hotelstaffso so,we had four rooms at the top of the brown it is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful lobby and well appointed clean rooms i stayed here with my 85 year old father his nurse 2 teenagers and 2 little kids everyone equally loved the hotel its a great place from which to walk around town my father loved sitting in lobby and felt part of the action there that having been said i never felt that i was a known to the staff after 3 days there are many interesting things in the hotel and it would be easy for them to have a small treasure hunt set up for young guests such as finding the upside down panels etc however no one remembered my name and the concierge absolutely stinks one time we were trying to head out and i wanted to ask a quick question but the concierge was on the phone with a prospective guest without never acknowledging me i finally just left the outside bellhops were awesome and they know the city well i simply just bypassed the inside staff and made a beeline for the sidewalk it is my expectation that booking 4 rooms at the brown i would have a staff ahead of me it was simply not the case we floundered a bit on resturants because the conceirge was awol i recommend it as a place to stay but dont count on anything extra from the interior staff they are not there to deliver the two exception is the friendly servers at the ships resturantbar and the maitre d at elingtons  should run the hotelhe is wonderul,3.0
definitely one to recommend to friends,we have just returned from a short break in new york and would thoroughly recommend the hilton garden inn times square the room was spacious clean and well equiped the staff at the hotel were all very helpful and the hotel was in an excellent location for all the major tourist attractions we would highly recommend a visit to the top of the rock  we did this at night and the view was spectacular,5.0
small clean  funky,the room is small but the worst thing was that there was no chest of drawers where to put our stuff my husband and i couldnt fit all of our clothes on 6 hangers so we had to live out of our suitcases the whole time the shower curtain was too short and after one of us took a shower water was spilled everywhere the bathroom door didnt stay opened it kept closing on us which was really annoying but we were lucky to have a bathroom door people on the 9th floor didnt have that there was no real light only small lamps by the bed and some funky light behind the bed when we entered the room late at night we had to walk all the way to the bed to turn on the little lamps some people from our group complained about the noisy heating system the heater was making clunky noises and kept waking them up they stayed on the 9th floor we stayed on the 17th floor and didnt have this problem the cleaning staff was very friendly they kept our room very clean the bar was cool the phone in our room wasnt working properly the tv was way too small and old for such a funky hotel for such small rooms they should install flat screens on the walls we paid 10 for 24hr internet connection in our room but the connection was very slow theres a european bakery next door starbucks cvs a supermarket an irish pub and sushi place subway is very close the room was clean and the queen size bed was very comfortable i liked the bed sheets they felt clean and there was no dirty comforter as in other hotels which i appreciated overall impression  small but clean and friendly staff,3.0
very bad service,the agents were not helpful friendly or caring the check in was not welcoming at all the room smelled bad and the concierge was interested in his computer more than he was of the people in front of him,1.0
great location amazing staff,my daughter and i recently stayed at the fairmont copley in boston the accommodation and location was perfect the staff was very helpful in helping us arrange our itinerary to see the most of boston in our four days there the room was clean and fresh and the hotel is very elegant i would highly recommend this hotel,5.0
frustratingly disappointed,unfortunately this property lived up to more of the negative than positive reviews posted here dark dreary rooms very oddly laid out though we had booked it in may and clearly stated there were 3 of us over the age of 17 we were given a room with only one king bed the staff begrudgingly supplied a rollaway but it was the most ghastly bed ever provided 3 inch thick matress encased in plastic and i had to beg for a pillow on an up note the breakfast offered was good enough and unlike a previous review cookies were available in the lobby best thing i can say is the coffee was fantastic id recommend choosing another place to stay,2.0
really is a two star motel,"i have never stayed at a red roof inn before but i found this one to be comparable and smaller than other 2 star motels like sleep inn days inn the lobby is sparsely furnished with a great coffeecappuccino machine the staff were pleasant and professional the doors to the rooms are located outside motelstyle the neighborhood seemed safe though even though it says on the inside of the door to lock both deadbolt and regular locks when i walked in i was surprised by how small the room was i got the room with the one king size bed if you want something bigger i would suggest requesting 2 double beds since there was no way 2 doubles could fit into my room the water pressure was on the milder side and the bathroom light was linked to the loud fan so you couldnt turn on one without the other 
it was hot the entire night since the automatic radiator was on and it kept on making clinking noises throughout the night i had to turn on the ac even though it was 20 degrees outsidesuch a waste of energy i didnt notice that the bed was extraordinarily comfortable but the sheets were clean with a thin blanket not down 
i was surprised also to find a 20 tax on my bill from county to state to city tax i would not stay here for leisure red roof inn was simple and did its job but did not have any of the extra amenities or comfort that a higher starred hotel would have be aware of what you pay for",3.0
great airport hotel and great service  very nice staff,"at the end of october we stayed overnight because we had a morning flight out of lax the checkin was quick and the service by front desk staff was outstanding special thanks to jason for helping us with our parking issue it made a huge difference to us the parking garage is nice and convenient
we had no airplane noise the service was outstanding at the evening managers reception and at breakfast the hotel staff went out of their way to make sure we got what we needed the shuttle to airport was convenient and frequent
the room was well appointed and spotless this was a real great place to stay and we would do it again",5.0
do not choose this hostel,"the hostel is located near the subway station so its easy to go
everywhere in dc also the rooms are clean and cozy
however the problem is the insincere attitude of the manager 
toward those who stay there very bad veryvery bad
i recommend you to choose another hostel or hotel even if
it costs you a little more",1.0
didnt meet expectations of a marriott,we were disappointed with our recent stay at the south park marriott although the front desk and bellman were very pleasant and helpful the service in areas such as room service and restaurant fell far short of what we expected after our room service meal was delivered we had to call back for them to deliver cream for the coffee and silverware needless to say by the time they came back the rest of the meal was cold they only had one person bartending and waitressing in the afternoon no fault to this lonely employee who was trying to serve everyone to the best of their ability but was not able to provide prompt service aside from the service there was mold growing on the bathtub tiles i was interested to see if they would clean it the next day which they did not the maid service also knocked on the door and asked if we we needed anything i thought daily cleaning was the norm for marriott and it was not necessary to request this service the computer area for business and customer use was at the junction of two hallways with alot of noise and traffic the computer was also facing the center of the room making everything on the screen visible to the other people standing around i would not stay at this hotel again with so many other options in the immediate area,4.0
stayed here when jfk flight was cancelled,the location is outstanding it is near the 911 memorial the views of the waterfront are breathtaking the rooms are small but clean and updated we had a 22 hour weather delay at jfk resulting in our staying at this hotel i am an elite marriott rewards member and stay at marriott properties throughout the usa and canada i was very frustrated by the hotel staff here this stay was well below par because of the staff they were overwhelmed both at the front desk and in the very expensive restaurant by the influx of unexpected guests there was a lot of confusion and they were obviously offended when i asked to speak to a manager the experience went downhill from there except for the staff everything else is very good,3.0
nice hotel but understandibly impersonal,"we stayed here for two nights upon arriving in san francisco before setting off on our road trip
location
the hotel is well located for shopping and main business section of the city it takes about 20 minutes to walk to pier 39 but is a pleasant walk
issues
nothing
positives
nothing spectacular  the hotel was lovely but very big
restaurant
we ate one meal in the restaurant  it was a nice location within the hotel although not particularly private food was good and prices reasonable service was friendly
room
our room was spacious and clean large wooden desk with plasma tv and a large bathroom
other comments
dont use the internet in the lobby  it cost us a fortune other than that a nice hotel the prices varied massively  we paid about 199 per night 100 at the time but then when we tried to book for two weeks later it was around 400 not worth that",4.0
enjoyable would go back,i spent two days in houston and chose the houstonian because of the reviews and spa connected with the hotel i wasnt dissapointed the spa was wonderful the hotel was clean attractive and made you forget you were in a major city the location of the hotel was perfect shopping nearby and many restaurants from which to choose i would certainly stay here again,4.0
mixed at best,"we didnt know what to expect when we booked our room at the catamaran we read through numerous reviews which were mixed at best all in all it turned out to be a just thatmixed here are our pros and cons from our stay
pros
the location is great its right on the bay and the ocean is right across the street
 the grounds on the resort were very nice and well maintained
 it was a good sized room
cons
 our hairdryer didnt work
 the water in the shower was inconsisent at best going from very hot to cold in a matter of seconds
 the 13 a night parking was just outrageous cause there is more than enough parking in the area to have to charge for parking
 the tv was fuzzy on most stations
 the thing that made the worst impression on us was that our cell phone charger went missing during our stay we are sure it was the housekeeper who had to unplug it to vacuum our room cause it was the in the only unused outlet in the room i guess if you plug something into their outlets than they get to keep it
so if you like location and are willing to overlook some inconveniences than i would say give the catamaran a shot",3.0
would not stay again,"i really dont understand how this hotel is ranked so high on tripadvisor my wife and i were in our late 20s just stayed here at the end of july for 3 nights and were somewhat disappointed like other reviews mention there is no elevator and ton of steps if youre carrying up luggage good luck checkin was fine no issues
i know the rooms were described as being small by other reviewers and even the hotel when booking but jeeez man they were tiny with both of our suitcases on the floor we literally had no room to walk our room was at the back of the hotel with a terrible view the hotel has no ac and even though it was not that hot the room always felt stuffy and warm the bathroom was also very small and found it difficult to move around in im 60 175lbs
the location is the best part of the hotel within walking distance to most tourist attractions in the city and there are bus stops located very close to the hotel as well the restaurant located to the left of the hotel when exiting was terrible i think it was called calzones the following night we had dinner at the house which was only 1 block from the hotel it was by far one of the best meals ive had ever 
stan the evening shift front desk person was also very helpful with directions and suggestions for sightseeing and meals 
i would not stay here again",2.0
loved this hotel,"i just got back from a weekend stay at le parker meridien the hotel is wonderful and the staff was great the check in was extremely quick 
room service was fast i must have called the front desk a dozen times for information on where an ice cream shop a dunkin donuts a candy shop etc and they were so helpful rooms were extremely clean and the beds were comfortable",4.0
could not ask for more,we had a family wedding the hotel was selected for us reading reviews i thought oh boy but honestly it was great yes there is an airport but it did not bother us everthing was exceptional the beds were the most comfortable i have ever slept on in a motel i am a bad sleeper so that is saying something the only problem we had was commication with the cleaning staff not very good english happens most places these days would never thought to much about it but we lost a a member of our family the housekeeper did not have clue what i was saying,4.0
great location elegant hotel,had a great stay here for a 4day conference and it was a great stay from the valet parking attendants to reception to room service everyone was helpful and efficient the view of the city and the fog rolling in was beautiful from my 19th floor room i had the breakfasts in my room which arrived on time and piping hot the room was spacious and nicely decorated large desk and lots of plugs for charging my devices on the desk and on the bedside table were great the bed was slightly hard but i still slept very well there are plenty of restaurants nearby plus youre just a short walk to market street and union square about halfway up a hill between them,5.0
clean comfy room in a nice neighborhood,"i am not sure what everyone is complaining about but my recent 5 night stay at the hilton was fantastic
lets begin with the front desk the agents were helpful and friendly i was able to check in right away with a smile 
my room was clean and comfortable the bathroom was clean towels were folded neatly my room had the view of the reservoir i suggest you get the rooms in odd numbers to face the reservoir
the barrestaurants service was impeccable the manager my guess knew the regulars even if they were not staying in the hotel greeted them by walking to them shaking their hands and getting them seated to the table personally my bartender was friendly and got my drinks right what else is there to criticize
there is a work out room which has 3 treadmills and 2 ellipticals and a stretch machine which if i can bring home i wouldve the pool is little disappointing but i wasnt planning on swimming so that was fine
the business center was also well managed clean and the programs offered users to delete every cookie and history every time you logged on fantastic only minus thing was that only one printer was working but no biggie wifi charges are 1495 per night i believe though i agree those things should be free by now
parking is 10 per day selfvalet you can find street parking if youd like but i went ahead with valet parking
there is saks fifth avenue within walking distance so is target lord  taylor is maybe half of a mile from the hotel the neighborhood seemed safe enough to walk down to targetsaks if needed there isnt a whole lot of sightseeing with an exception of the barnes foundation  which was life changing
location safe rooms clean service good what else are you looking for",5.0
a little dated but nice accommodations,"i stayed here at the westin july 2427 while i attended the echo conference in dallas and i was very pleased with the large room extremely comfortable bed they even sell and market their bed set at crazy high prices and the goodsized flat screen tv i didnt get to try out the pool or fitness center but they are very accommodating the fitness center has lots of machines and space to work out 
the rooms are a little dated but big and the hotel area seems safe enough i didnt have a car so i walked a lot i went across the large highway one night just venturing out but i didnt feel that safe coming back in the dark with a car youd be fine",5.0
great stay ,great stay hotel staff were very helpful and kind hotel lobby was freezing cold because of a nasty cold frontim sure it would be pleasant any other time  beds were comfy and i slept like a baby i think you really need a car in this area i would not feel comfortable walking at night however the hotel shuttle comes very oftenfast food restaurants across the streets i would recommend this hotel to travellers ,4.0
new and neat design,this is a great hotel for a business stay quick check in ample and welllit parking nicely laidout room with an empty fridge target is just across the way bar with small takeout selection including fruit and lots of seating areas 24 hour fitness two tvs sparkling bath good lighting nice teas and coffee  in short everthing one needs for a comfortable stay,4.0
a perfect staycation spot to celebrate my husbands birthday,"since we are a part of the starwood preferred guest program we tend to stay only at starwood properties and are on the whole very impressed with their hotels we chose to celebrate my husbands birthday with luxuriating at the st regis in town  and it was one of our top experiences with the starwood brand
once the staff realized it was my husbands birthday they sent up a special treat as a welcome gift after checking in we so enjoyed starting off the evening with a fantastic spread of champagne cheese and raw honey 
the room was beautiful the service was detailorientated and fullservice and the atmospheredecor was fantastic for the holiday season
thank you to the dc st regis for making my husbands 35th birthday that much more special",5.0
there are small rooms then there is the standard,"i realise that new york space comes at a premium but this room is ridiculous 
ive stayed in small hotel rooms on the past like in tokyo but this room lacks the super smart design that is required to get away with it and still charge over 250night on sale 
there is no where to put even one suitcase 
there is only one bedside table so my phone and stuff are on the ground 
they have dedicated half of the wardrobe to an albeit excellent minibar 
and the customised desk was not customised enough to fit into the unusual corner it occupies so it is wasting space and jutting into the very tiny room 
other than these points everything else is excellent the bar and restaurant staff and food are both wonderful the fitful of the lobby and restaurant spaces are done in a sophisticated but welcoming fashion and the exterior of the hotel is very interesting 
the standard east village rooms ours is on the 11th floor and has a great view would be ok for one person not two but if you do decide to stay here be very clear with your cab driver on the address because ours took us to the other standard which was frustrating after 17 hours in the air",4.0
great location,we stayed here while attending conference this wouldnt have been my first choice as far as a place to stay as it was pricey but work foot the bill i was disappointed to find a pretty dirty hotel room and for this price bracket i expected more we did enjoy lounging on the roof pool and looking towards the city from the roof i did visit the gym and i thought it was pretty dirty i am usually not too picky about these things but when you find hair in the bed and bathroom it is always a turn off meeting facilities were perfect,3.0
soso for the price,the room was clean not too bad but a little on the small side my problem is not with the room but the fact that i was not aware that there was a fee to park my boyfriend and i drove seperately since we were coming from 2 different directions so we ended up paying 20 plus tax per parking pass so that total ended up being 4480half the cost of the room just to park our cars what makes this worse is that it was totaled into the cost of the stay but now the hotel is holding that 4480 on my charge card not a good system and should have on their website before making a reservation that there is a fee to park,3.0
great stay,we stayed at the residence inn for a july weekend and had a great time our suite on the 16th floor was spacious clean and comfortable we looked over city hall and loved the view we could hear no noise from the hotel but you could hear city noise outside even from the 16th floor breakfast was excellent and the dining room was spacious and clean we walked everywhere  independence hall 15 minutes rittenhouse square 15 minutes phil museum of art 25 minutes and the franklin institute 20 minutes neighborhood is fine during the day but do keep alert at night especially around city hall staff was helpful and we appreciated that our room was ready for us when we arrived at 11 am tiny quibbles only one shampoo conditioner etc provided for two people for the weekend  we could have used a refill also the lobby is pretty sparce  no sitting areas or bar regardless we would definitely return,5.0
comfy friendly hotel in a great neighborhood,i stayed for one night prior to a conference the staff is personable and professional the food was very good my room was small but i expected that and it was fine the neighborhood is historical and quaint the hotel is close to the boston common there is a starbucks and a cvs nearby but the stores are predominantly boutiques and nonchain cafes etc i gave 4 dots for sleep quality because the garbage trucks show up on charles street in the dead of night but i am a light sleeper anyway i would go back in a heartbeat,5.0
great hotel in heart of san fran,our stay at hotel rex was terrific the hotel is charming and in a great location the staff was respectful and polite yes the rooms might be smaller than an average american hotel but not by much the size of our room certainly did not present any problems  all amenities were readily available the charm of the hotel more than made up for any room size issues the room size was definitely larger than most european hotels ive stayed in we ordered nonfeather pillows from the front desk and they were delivered promptly we were able to easily store our bags after checkout because we had a late flight a perfect stay,5.0
excellent hotel that lived up to expectations and standards,this hotel is conveniently and centrally situated the staff are excellent and superbly trained in every area i have kept this review short because there are no ifs and buts and things to wactch out for the hotel is excellent and of the highest standard,5.0
never disappointed with hampton inn,have stayed at several hampton inns over the years and always leave satisfied the pricing is fair room very clean and comfortable the staff always greets you with a smile and very helpfull with knowledge of the local area stayed here on business so did not have time to enjoy the facilities they do have valet parking for 35 or park yourself for 25 both off site at the end of the block its next to the convention center so you can leave your car and walk the breakfast buffet is very convenient or if in a rush grab a bag on the way out if back in philly would stay again,4.0
these guys block netflix and limit tv to make you buy their movies,id recommend this hotel with caveats nice older hotel but not up to date with limited electrical outlets no bars furnished and they block netflix really a tacky way of doing business i will look for somewhere else next time or preload my computer with what i want to watch,4.0
location location location,my wife and kids stayed here for 3 nights this hotel is centraly located from all attractions we spent lots of time at the farmers market and the grove although the room were small and there were only double beds for our family we enjoyed the stay,4.0
great airport hotel,very nice hotel the rooms have just been renovated and they are large and comfortable the staff are very friendly and helpful ive stayed here several times and never had an issue with noise from the airport very clean nice restaurant,4.0
plusses and minusses of a good hotel,"the quality of the omni berkshire is undisputed after a weeklong stay for a short vacation in new york i want to add my voice to the crowd of satisfied customers being generally satisfied i do not want to point weaknesses without also spelling out the more satisfying facets of my stay at the omni what has displeased me
 the omni berkshire website describes their premier room as enjoying sweeping city views but dont dream about sweeping allaround the first room they sent us to 702 was instead enjoying the full frontal view of the office building on the other side of the street there was not a chance to see even a bit of blue sky from that place we protested at first to no avail but finally a manager came and offered us to a higher floor room with a better but still far from sweeping view to be fair that second room was ok but the point is that you dont want to have to fight to get what you have paid for 
 the wifi network is free for those subscribing to the fidelity program which is very good but incredibly slow hell you are in new york how can such a slow connection be offered in a business hotel
 the fireside restaurant pretends to serve starbucks coffees we took a latte and a cappuccino 7 bucks each and both were very bad
in all other aspects this is a pleasant hotel
 the location could not be beaten
 the staff is always courteous and friendly
 the bed is very good
 they offer breakfast beverages to the members of their fidelity club
 they offer both national and local newspapers
if you are not counting on an internet connection to work and you dont bother that much for the view the omni is an excellent hotel for you you will sleep well and enjoyed a friendly environment but if you care for a view and you need to use the internet you may be a bit frustrated",4.0
great location,"wonderful location great stay this hotel is on 40th between 6th and 7th ave we took the train into penn station so we only had 6 blocks to walk to the hotel bryant park with ice skating in winter is on the corner 
from here we walked to rockefeller center and the broadway shows we attended
the beds were very comfortable the concierge helpful and the rooms were clean the elevator was slow  but that seems to be the norm in nyc
we recommend this hotel",4.0
excellent customer service at checkin,i stay at this hotel at least 23 times a month and love the personlaized service i get kudos to eduardo for always extending a helpful hand and for making my stay superb  your welcoming smile when i check in close to midnight after a long day helps ease my feelings of exhaustion keep up the excellent service,5.0
fantastic stay at the flatiron in chelsea nyc,this was our first stay in nyc as a family 3 kids ages 6 to 12 years and loved this hotel the room was beautifully appointed with all sorts of electronic gadgets including automatic curtain closers which the kids loved along with the tv screen built into the bathroom mirror and the amazing fish tank in the lobby the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the room was spotless however room 504 faced the street and was drafty and a bit noisy the windows are original single pane windows got a great deal thru hotwire,4.0
only thing good was the location,"i was on a business trip and booked this hotel if someone is looking for a good location and doesnt care about anything else this would be the hotel for them the lobby was renovated but deceiving
the rooms were old shower was not clean ac didnt work and it was 85 degrees that night beds were squeaky extremely old rugs doors were scratched and not painted in all it was a disastor i have travelled a lot and have stayed in many hotels i would certainly categorize this one as the worst",1.0
very pleased with hotel and staff,my wife travels with me during the summer on my business trips she was so excited with the wonder view from our hotel room the staff were very friendly and courteous and respectfull of us the room was clean and well maintained we were very pleased with our stay,5.0
passing thru,the room was big and designed perfectly the lay out of the room was exceptional compared to some of the bigger names in suites this one compared the little bar area with fridge and microwave was perfect in space and placed in a neat area the only thing id change would be the paper productsa little rough,4.0
nice hotel good location,the hotel was great nice pool for my son and the rooms were very clean and nice the only thing i didnt like was at checkin our room wasnt ready so we had to leave and come back there arent a lot of restaurants super close but within a few blocks which is ok if its nice out overalla recommend,4.0
andaz 5th ave is excellent hotel in nyc,"we visit nyc several times a year andaz 5th ave is our home away when we are in nyc we had a corner suites with beautiful views love the foot bath especially after a long walk all day long 
love the coffee bar and breakfast at the shop was so good make sure you order chef vences specialty lemon poppy seeds pancakes it is so delicious and please do say hello to chef vence he is a great chef
the staff on this hotel is very friendly and yet professional always ask if we need anything over drink and wine while waiting for room to be ready or waiting for friend to pick us
we are looking forward to get back to this hotel",5.0
if you love cockroaches  stay here,"blech we stayed here in august and on the last morning i discovered a cockroach doing the backstroke in my wineglass which was on the bedside table from the night before
the manager seems apologetic and offered to comp our foodbill of 60 which was the only charge we incurred as i had booked with spg points however i see on my amex bill that they only comped us 20 and charged us the remainder for some inexplicable reason
that issue coupled with the apparent tap dancing family residing above us i swear they were running around in their room from 7am to 1am every night we were there made for a terrible experience my usually unflappable 10 year old insisted that we never stay at a sheraton property again i would have to agree",1.0
pinch me  can this be real,"my wife and i spent one night at the andaz hyatt this past saturday the service was superb the room was spacious and very comfortable with the sorts of amenities that i rarely splurge for in this case it was no splurge at all  the room rate was downright reasonable  205  night which included a 50 credit per couple towards their excellent hearty brunch the decor in the room was similar to a w hotel i stayed in recently complete w large soaking tub rain forest like separate shower huge desk w built in hookups for internet power plugs etc the refrigerator was fully stocked  help yourself to anything  you only pay for the booze free chocolate bars granola bars chips saratoga bottled water soda etc the room utilizes mobile and rotating furniture modules that i had never seen before  very cool there was also a complimentary coffee  wine bar in the lobby i have heard of exceeding expectations  but this was outrageous
and dont let me forget to mention how helpful and professional all the staff were  from lobby to maid service to dining room oh yeah wall street is kind of a cool place to stay",5.0
bare bones lodging experience,"my wife and i stayed here while visiting friends in the city the hotel is in a great location steps away from public transit options to some of nycs best destinations and surrounded by a neat area inside the property and rooms can best be described as bare bones almost hostellike this might be great for the traveler on a tight budget who just needs a place to crash but dont expect much beyond that
for our case in particular we asked when making reservations whether there was wifi access in the rooms to get some work done and were told we would be placed in one that did have inroom access when we arrived we were told no rooms had wifi but that it was available in the lobby then even in the lobby the connection was only barely usable and most of the time not even that the staffs final recommendation just go to a starbucks we also were apparently placed in a room adjacent to a storeroom of some sort and so at various intervals during all times of night and day the wall our beds headboard was against would shake with the loud sounds of equipment being moved or stored when we called about it they said theyd look into it and never got back to us
the pros unique decor convenient location in a neat neighborhood very friendly staff cons some misleading marketing about amenities small rooms with not much room to maneuver and sound seems to carry between hallways and the rooms",2.0
most likely will not return,"i would think that anyone who runs a successful hotel would know that the front desk person is the face of the hotel to anyone who is arriving the front desk folks were just well kind of blah actually they were almost condescending i like to feel welcome and made to believe that they are happy i am there but that did not happen and this was the whole three days not a smile within a mile i had a groupon deal and showed him the wrong code he just said thats not the right one and went back to doing whatever it was he was doing on his computer i asked about a restaurant the following morning and got the name slightly wrong i was curtly corrected the whole ambience of the front desklobby was just kinda snooty 
other little things added up to a not so exceptional stay
the sheets would not stay tucked in i hate waking up during the night and having to retuck the sheets they were too small
the carpet was wrinkled up in several places in the room
the room had a mildly mildew smell not overwhelming but just unpleasant when you first entered
the tv remote would not turn the tv onoff had to do that manually
the lamp plugins and our phone chargers kept falling out of the wall sockets dont know what was up with that
it cost 3000night fo park and valet parking is the only option available i know this is a trend with downtown hotels but 30night is dang near highway robbery there might have been a parking garage in the area but we did not check it out
this is an historical hotel and generally we love to stay in the older hotels but it felt like perhaps the menger is resting on its laurels these days we stayed here many years ago and had the most amazing wonderful stay thats why we booked again
other stuff
the rooms are very small but to be expected in historical hotels
the ac was cold a good thing in texas in august
the location is wonderful its right across the street from the riverwalk and next door to the alamo
real glasses not paper cups but they are very small
coffee maker in the room
the cleaning staff were wonderful and accomodating i asked to exchange a decaf coffee packet for a regular and she gave me four regular for the next day too she was smiling and welcoming and just plain nice maybe they should put her on the front desk
strong shower pressure and the tub drains well just one of those little irritations if it doesnt work
if i were returning to san antonio anytime soon i woud not book the menger hotel again i might add that a pleasant welcoming staff will often cover a multitude of sins but when you dont feel welcome those little things add up real quick",3.0

trip of the summer,six months ago we purchase tickets to six flag for my familys upcoming trip we were in cincinnati all excited to go to six flags only to find out that they werent six flag anymore we pulled up waterparks and discover fort rapids which was about 2 12 hours drive the kids were excited so we purchase 8 tickets and proceed to the water park wow my kids had a blast after riding all the slides it was just perfect for our family the staff were very friendly and willing to answer all our questions we got a villa suite which had everyhing to cater to our needs nicely laid out private bedrooms and bathrooms on the day of check out we had the opportunity to swim all day again this is now our family vacation destination because of price and distance we will definitely be back,5.0
great location and very nice room,"its always nice to come back to the new yorker when visiting new york the hotel was refurbished after my last visit and the new rooms are even better than before
since they had a nice offer the week before christmas i decided to have a little luxury and stayed in one of the tower suites with a great view of the empire state building it seems these rooms were made by joining two rooms so you have one living room and a bedroom with bathroom
the location couldnt be better bit i knew that already just next to the subway and within easy walking of most theaters
service was good but i didnt need very much just checkingin and out and fortunately the lines werent very long
the weather was also very good during the 5 days i visited ",4.0
exceeded expectations in a mostly disappointing city,this motel is a block away from greyhound terminal a local there warned us about staying at this place called kings court i walked around town and found and booked this place because it was the cheapest and they let us check in early only later did i find out this was the old kings court i took our key and made my way towards our building expecting the worst but the hotel is fully renovated everything worked including the tv the staff were good not exceptional but hey this is not a 5 star place the room was clean bed linen and towels were all clean for the price you cant go wrong in memphis,4.0
good location rooms small but only by us standards,"my partner and i stayed at the milner for two nights during a twoweek tour of the us east coast 
originally we were supposed to be staying across town but the icelandic volcano had other ideas so we changed our plans and stayed at the milner instead
after browsing some of the reviews i must admit i was a bit apprehensive about staying at the milner but due to the last minute nature of our arrangements we couldnt exactly be piccy about our accomodation
the first thing id have to say is that the milners location is excellent especially if you are only in boston for a short time the hotel is a 2 minute walk from boston common and the beginning of the citys famed freedom trail bus and t connections are frequent from boyleston station located at the edge of the common and also within close proximity to the hotel
secondly id like to dismiss some of the ridiculous claims about customers being unable to move due the size of the rooms at the milner
yes they are small but the hotel doesnt ever claim that they are large and i think its important to remember that the milner was built in the civil war era and not exactly with 21st century needs in mind
so yes dont expect kingsize beds vast expanses of carpet or faceless furniture fittings  that is all part of the milners appeal
if you want all that then go to a large coporate chain hotel in fact there is one right across the street
in fact i was marginally impressed at the size of the hotel room not to say that theyre large but by the number of overthetop references on here about the room sizes i was expecting something resembling a shoebox i have travelled extensively in europe and the rooms at the milner are typical of what youd expect in a similartype guesthouse in paris rome or barcelona for example
having said all that there isnt much space in the lobby or the dining hall which can be a squeeze on busy mornings but like i said thats all part of the milner appeal
there was plenty of choice for a small breakfast buffet and even a chance to have a go at making your own waffles this may sound strange but for me and my partner this was a first
the rooms were more than adequate for what me and my partner required which in no particular order wasp a comfortable bed plenty of cupboard space an iron and ironing board a tv with plenty of channels adequatelyfitted bathroom towels and a few flyersmagazines about what to do in boston
all in all the milner is ok with me",3.0
clean hotel,this hotel was very clean and well maintained the bed was extremely comfortable overall we had a great stay,5.0
great location nice hotel,"yes it is a bit dated but the retro decor is fun and funky the bed was heavenly new downlike lite comforter and thick soft pillows the pool area is happening on weekends it is close to everything and convenient best of all as a woman traveling alone i always felt safe there 
 i was a bit put off by the 1000 a night parking fee but it seems to be common in the area",4.0
great bang for your buck,this hotel is great the extras that come with your room is a reason to keep coming back each day of your stay there is a breakfast buffet complete with eggshashbrowns sausage pancakes biscuits gravy cerals pastries bagels and juices and there is also an evening reception that offers 3 alcoholic beverages per person along with hot foods like hot dogs nachos mac and cheese meatballs pasta salad and chili what is extra special about the hotel are the many terrace and roof top spots to enjoy we visited 3 rooftop spots there may have been more the staff was very friendly and helpful this hotel is on the riverwalk you just take the access from the lobby downstairs and around the corner is the most lively part of the area we will definitely stay here again,5.0
exquisite hotel not to be missed,"my mother and i have just returned from spending 3 nights at the beautiful hayadams hotel in room 806 the visit was our annual motherdaughter break and a birthday treat for my mother therefore i was very appreciative of the room upgrade given after our long journey to dc we were both extremely delighted with our room it had a sensational view of the white house and it really was a dream come true for my mother to wake up and go to sleep looking at this incredible iconic view i was also thrilled with the goodies in the room including a cake to acknowledge my mothers celebration
the hayadams hotel is absolutely superb the level of service and understated luxury truly sets this hotel apart from others i travel very often for work and am extremely particular about where i stay this hotel far exceeded my expectations and hence it is now my favourite hotel in the us and hence i can not recommend it highly enough it is one of those hotels that i would urge everyone to experience at least once 
we had cocktails at off the record and breakfast at the lafayette which we thoroughly enjoyed unfortunately we did not have time to have lunch or dinner at the lafayette however we will ensure that we do so next time we stay here
the location is faultless which helped us to make the most of our time in dc every member of the team provided exceptional service and did everything possible to ensure that our stay was perfect in every way as a result we will be back and will certainly be recommending this fine beautiful hotel to family friends and colleagues an experience not to be missed do not hesitate to stay at one of the most exquisite hotels in the us you deserve it",5.0
location ideal not luxury but great bang for the buck will do over,location as to the gas lamp districthorton plaza mall about 6 blocks down hill cab runs you about 5 each way we used our aaa card and got a fabulous rate on our room we were shocked the rooms are small but all you need is there nice big tv micro fridge nice bathroom and comfy full size bed perfect for cuddling  very clean continental breakfast in the morning a plus parking is street parking and found it to be great since its free between 6pm  8 am on weekdays and no metering on weekends didnt see any children running around most guests we saw i would say are in there mid 2040s  there are i believe 3 floors elevators available staff was pleasant i would def do over unless i was planning a indoor getaway which i would never ever do in san diego ,4.0
the iroquois is as nearly perfect an experience as you can get,"we spent three nights at the iroquois in aprilmyself our teenage daughter and my husband we chose a suite and in effect found it was two rooms for the price of one our daughter could shut the door and have her own space and a very comfortable bed
the hotel is brilliantly locatedan easy walk to the theatre district times square empire state building fifth avenue and of course good shopping at the same time when you walk inside it feels like an oasis the door is opened for you with a smile and its quiet and comfortable inside the desk staff greet you with a steaming cup of cidervery refreshing
the room was spacious immaculately clean and nicely furnished each evening your bed is turned down and chocolates and a weather report left on your pillow if i could change one thing id have windows that can openbut that would allow noise so it might not suit somethe double glazing meant it was very quiet there was also one waitress who disappointed with her cool attitude
however the rest of the staff were terrificand thats what really makes the place absolutely everyone elsefrom cleaners doormen and most of all the desk staff were ready and willing to help and generously sorted out any problem for example we were offered umbrellas on rainy days and were allowed to shower and warm up after a drenching on the last day of our stay long after we should have checked out of the roomand for a very reasonable extra fee really the staff make the place what it isa perfect spot for wonderful holiday",5.0
crapprepare to be shouted at and have your money stolen,"the reviews seemed mixed between satisfied customers and bad experiences 
i choose this hotel based on recent positive reviews attractive location and low price 
we were not expecting too much based on the price but i am completely shocked at the service we received 
upon checking it we were given a room that seemed to have been unoccupied for decades dirty smelly with cobwebs hanging off the headrest of the bed and the various corners of the room when my wife asked if there were other rooms available the man at the counter shouted at her that they were fully booked and challenged us to move out 
with most other hotels fully booked due to the fleet weekend we of course had no choice but to stay unless we could find another hotel we politely requested that room service clean up the room while we were out we came back to find absolute nothing done in the end we had to clean the room ourselves
we woke up the next morning itching after a nightmare night in the dirty bed to make things worst we went down to the breakfast room to be greeted by the same grumpy old man who shouted at my wife he proceeded to grumble at us and all the other guest and bang the food onto the tables
to complete the nightmare we realized that housekeeping had stolen money from my wifes purse we were sure that she had not misplaced or dropped the money as she had counted the money the night before and did not remove her purse from her handbag from the time she counted her money till the time we realized the loss the only time her purse was left unattended was when she left the room for a few minutes to use the very slow wifi in the conference room housekeeping was just cleaning the room next door when she stepped out and nowhere to be found when she returned a few minutes later
in short do not stay here spend a little bit more money for peace of mind in a better hotel in fact we saw a much better posher hotel grand plaza hotel just around the corner which offers room at the same price it was unfortunate that they had no rooms available or we would have moved there",1.0
creepy isolated and waaaaay overpriced,if you wanted to get away from it all or hideout this might be a good choice if you think you are checking into a luxury resort forget it if you are not a nature lover or staying on property the entire time for a program this is a lousy choiceremote limited services and downright spooky at night the restaurant closed at 9 chairs and equipment were piled up in the former bookstore and classrooms its outrageously overpriced for what you get there was no tv in the room understandable for a  holistic retreat experience but not as a luxury accomodation our package included breakfast for an additional 50 but not worth the 45 min it took the first morning or the second morning which i chose to skip entree choices due to the long delay in even getting coffee the scone i settled for was tiny and cold the property was nearly deserted but we were put in the farthest building next door to a building that was totally dark and looked abandoned and very creepy at night we had to walk 10 minutes in the dark to get anything out of the car which had to be left at the top of a hill in a parking lot big uncovered holes along the path could have been a disaster as could the campfire left burning and unattended on a windy night with acres of dry timber the golf cart that transported us crammed up next to our luggage to our room at check in had wet seats but was better than checkout where our luggage was tossed into the flat bed of another cart filled with tools and maintenance equipment and no room for us not my idea of either luxury treatment or a retreat experience this place is riding on the beauty the crossings created and charging rates you would pay at a true luxury resort but it is far from luxury i think even the staff is uncomfortable being in what feels like an isolated if not nearly abandoned property since my walking in the door during the day caused the clerk to jump and say i had scared him the largest number of other people i ever saw in the place was 12 and 8 of those may have been part of the crew doing a promotional photo shoot there i was so disappointed that such a formerly beautiful and peaceful place now seemed to be so badly exploited or was it just me who felt exploited i can tell you i did when i checked out and saw a gratuity had been added onto the entire cost of the bill on top of the already excessive costs i will never stay at this place again as long as it is under this banner,1.0
excellent stay friendly staff,stayed at the parc 55 wyndham in november for a conference everything from the reception desk to the cleaning staff was perfect the beds are super comfortable it was actually the best sleep ive had in awhile i had a very nice corner room with panoramic views of downtown san francisco the staff was more than accomodating in helping me arrange a semiprivate dinner at the restaurant on the property i was very impressed with all of their efforts the hotel is downtown  so its very close and within walking distance to the moscone convention center and many other attractions and shopping areas my one and only issue is that there is no free internet access about 15 per day for the cost of the hotel one would think internet would be a complimentary amenity especially since most of the guests are business travelers otherwise  no complaints,5.0
not bad on a budget,this hotel is in ne san antonio right off i35 i didnt hear the train noise some were complaining about but was at the back of the property overall not a bad budget hotel one issue i encountered was they were renovating a room on the ground floor right below ours and started at 8am friday morning awoke to sounds of hammers and drilling not sure what they were thinking but anyway breakfast is average liked the happy hour and pool was ok staff were good parking is a bit tricky if you arrive late,3.0
great service,"my business partner and i were wowed by the service at the gaslamp hilton when we stayed every employee that we spoke to from housekeeping to management were courteous and eager to please another plus is that the hotel is very close to both the gaslamp restaurants convention center and the trolley  prime location
some things to consider if you want a room here
parking can be extremely expensive everywhere in the gaslamp  the area is deliberately not carfriendly on a saturday night just use the hotel valet service be careful because they charge up to 30 a night  but the service is really nice if you take your car out all the time best bet is to be dropped off or find another way here and forget the car 
the room furnishings are adequate although people who pay over 200 a night may find themselves wanting better quality trains and trolleys pass by the convention center side but with windows closed its not a big deal at night i thought the bed was wonderful  i had trouble getting to my conference sessions 
service in the lobby restaurant is great although the food is pretty basic fare we thought it was a great place to stay but our business footed the bill so it might be different if we payed out of pocket i will say that ive never had a friendlier total hotel staff than the one at the gaslamp hilton",4.0
pleasant staff good location cheap toilet paper,"the hilton garden inn uptown is very conveniently located just a few blocks from the main drag on tryon street and close to the sports stadiumarena the staff was pleasant and the rooms were clean the breakfast was not great not terrible  slightly stale pastries and whatnot but ive had worse its pretty inexpensive for the area so its a good value 
the only major complaint i have is the extremely scratchy toilet paper if i ever stay here again ill bring my own roll no joke",3.0
better than last time which was pretty darn goodnear perfect stay,"finding a familyappropriate hotel is sometimes hardbut the catamaran was wonderful the grounds were beautiful and very entertaining for our kids ages 4 6 9 our room was really nice we stayed there three years ago and i could tell that our room had been updated since then i think the furniture was the same but it appeared to have new carpet and the bathroom vanity area appeared newer it was very clean too wore white socks around the room the first night and couldnt see anything on the bottoms the tubtoilet area of the bathroom is not fancy just a simple tub and toilet if you are expecting glass shower surrounds and seperate tub and shower area you might want to look elsewhere our room was on the ground floor of a twostoried building and was super quiet we could only hear our neighbors when they were coming in their door from the outside we could hear our upstairs neighbors walking around occassionally but overallprobably one of the quietest we have ever stayed in room was a great size for our family of 5 our littlest slept on a toddler cot we brought from home we requested a microwave and with that and the refrigerator we were able to make several light meals in our room
location location location seriously it cant be beat loved being on the bay and one block from the beach it was our sons 4th birthday the day we arrived and upon checking in the gal helping us out made it a point to wish me happy birthday for him and gave us a nice little perkfree parking for our stay that was awesome our kids used the pool every day and had a blast it was never overly busy in the pool area and was very familyfriendly 
mission beach is a beachy downtoearth community if you are expecting more glitz and glamour perhaps you should try la jolla shores area i have spent many summers in my youth at mission and pb and i love that it is so casual comfortable and not overlypretentious the restaurants are small and there really arent any big chains in the area unless you count subway 
we ate a couple times at the little mexican restaurant right next to the hotel and it was super yummy and very afforadable we also ate at world famousbeachocean view and it is a nice family restaurant when eating there with small children we actually prefer to sit in the bar area over the regular restaurant because there are more kidfriendly meal options plus its cheaper 
the catamaran was very easy to find and very close to sea world and other touristy areas 
only recommendation for the hotelselflaundry service the hotel laundry is too expensive and if you are staying for an extended time it would be nice to have laundry facilties onsight",5.0
served a purpose  would not stay again,the room is clean and the bed was made after a nights stay some of the towels given were dirty placed some items in the closet  they came out damp would not stay here alone however had a friend with me complimentary breakfast  not really worth it  didnt even have bread to make toast staff were polite however did not understand what i was saying at times i would not stay again near the airport  planes can be heard and fly right over the inn however not a huge issue for us but could be if you are a light sleeper or want some peace and quiet,2.0
perfect location to see the sights in dc,we just returned from our first time staying at this hotel we booked on priceline and i think we got a really good deal i was hoping to find a decent hotel that we could afford on a saturday night that was in a good downtown location i couldnt have asked for more after hearing so much about the metro and how easy it is to use and the convenience we figured wed give it a try and how perfect this hotel is built on top of a metro station not all stations have parking though and since it costs 33day to park at the hotel we chose a nearby station that did offer free parking on weekends we left the car there overnight saturday to sunday with no problems and free we arrived at the hotel around 1pm and inquired about check in they said they dont start that until 4pm it wasnt a problem we just continued with our sightseeing and riding the metro we came back to the hotel around 430 and checked in with no problem we had a room with two double beds overlooking the roads and also a nice view of the harbor the beds were comfortable and the room was clean i personally loved the blackout shades they had on the windows this is so important when trying to sleep in when im on vacation and not all hotels have them a definite plus in my book we didnt choose to eat at the restaurant at the hotel because of hearing how pricey it is but at least you have it as an option we did use the hotel pool for a short period of time it was pretty crowded but a nice little refreshment after walking all day overall i would say if you are looking for a hotel downtown so you dont have to drive everywhere this is your place it has character and may need some updating which i guess they are working on based on the construction we saw going on but it met all of our needs if you are someone who needs complete peace and quiet during your stay this might not be for you you can definitely hear the trains going in and out and from what i can see on their website i think i saved almost half of a normal nights stay by booking through priceline,5.0
this was in a great location,"the room was clean and comfortable housekeeping was very good as was the friendliness in the restaurant the food on the 17th floor was excellent the woman at the desk whose name tag said edith was very friendly and helpful the valet service people were also very friendly
the only suggestion for improvement would be that it would have been helpful to have a luggage rack in the room",4.0
good deal for the discount,"the hotel was good we had no problems having read prior reviews about construction i asked for a room far away from the 4th floor and they kindly gave us the 15th so there were no noise issues the rooms were clean the staff was nice
some people say it is far away but were bostonians and walk all the time anyways so to us well we love a nice walk anyways walking through the upper east side strolling to delis and shops on our way to the museums and central park was wonderful if you have trouble walking  well cabs are always available and cheap by boston standards or you may want to choose someplace closer to your destination if youre going to the met guggenheim etc this is fine
parking was no trouble and cheap for nyc the hotel gives you a validation and if you leave your car there its 20day
the hotel is not in the heart of the upper east side it is in fact in yorkvillecarnegie hill there is public housing right across the street but that doesnt bother us since thats exactly the same as where we live in boston rampant crime in public housing is a myth in seven years in this location in boston we have never experienced streetcrime living near public housing similarly we had no trouble in nyc if myths about public housing scare you then by all means pay double for the midtown asphalt noise and pollution otherwise like us you may enjoy strolling through the leafy streets in the nicest part of nyc the upper east side",4.0
great location,we stayed here on feb25 while visiting for a pacers game hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly they have a pool hot tub and exercise facility in the basement which is very nice the hotel is within walking distance of conseco and circle centre mall and to save money park at the hallmark building on pennsylvania for 8 a night for breakfast i would recommend la peep on the corner of new york and illinois just about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel highly recommend good value for the price,5.0
great property lousy rooms,just spent the weekend at this resort participating in meetings with coworkers from around the country grounds are beautiful lobby is modest but modern conference rooms and food are exceptional but the guest rooms a good amount of our spare time was spent comparing stories about bugs dust mildew slow draining sinks and tubs rusty bathroom fixturesmanagement should gut all the rooms and remodel them to meet current standards,2.0
perfect place for a trendy week end in nyc,"we have just returned from a 3 days weekend in new york our 2 nights at the revington hotel contributed to make it a memorable experience first of all the location is just great for those who do not want to stay in the so crowded and so touristic areas of the city the lower east side is a great alternative to discover the inside manhattan atmosphere the hotel is 10 mn walk from soho tribeca nolita and little italy 20 mn walk from greenwich village or union square and 5mn walk to the metro station from where you could reach central park in the upper side  we only took metro twice when our feet couldnt carry us anymore 
the hotel is trendy and design rooms are immaculate and offering an astonishing view ours was on the 11th floor the shower is just huge and spotless above all the matresses are really incredible something like a new system taking into account your weight to support your entire body sur mesure cant describe it has to be experienced
the evening service left both nights on our bed side table either cookies and browniesvery appreciated attention
we definetly and highly recommend this place",5.0
perfect manhattan hotel,"i just stayed at the hampton inn times square july 27 2007 the hotel was immaculate and in the best possible location the staff was very nice and happy to assist in any questions about local hot spots we were a a block from the subway a couple from times square and broadway do not believe the bad reviews because this was one of the nicest hotel i have stayed inn we booked the king sitting room it was very big by nyc standards and was very clean every day when we returned 
 parking your vehicle was a breeze right next door in a secure undergound lot i think it was 26 usd a day but on par with everywhere else like the other reviews say this place is a gem and will stay there again when i return
i strongly reconmend the harbour lights cruise the guide was very knowledgable and did not over talk take it the first night there and you will know where everything is and what it is called after you are done incredible views of manhattan ny and hoboken nj 
also the hoponhopoff bus tour for 48hrs you can use it as your taxi around the city and a bus comes every 15 mins if you want to jump back on
stay here if you want no problems",5.0
great hotel but disappointing service,on our trips to new york city for client meetings we have always stayed at this hotel the location is perfect for us and we love the view of central park this year because of tis past weekend being so close to christmas it was indeed very busy as we had breakfast included in our rate roomservice or the dinning room we ordered room service we were told it would be up right away an hour later the coffee arrived but no breakfast then a half hour later the breakfast came however there were no knives so we buttered our toast with our spoons the next morning we decided we would go to the dinning room the wait to be seated was onerous with vacated tables in sight it took almost,3.0

alright for a family on a budget,"we stayed here on the advice of several people on the ta forums and it wasnt that bad its not in a nice area really but very convenient i dont think its worth what they charge and we had the managers special but otherwise not bad the room we had was very dark and dreary located behind the office but it was nice for getting three kids in and out of parking lot it was depressing to have it so dark and the decor doesnt help but you cant have everything i was also annoyed to discover that while they say they have a laundry there actually isnt one and its a good drive away  you couldnt walk to it carrying any amount of laundry the pool and hot tub area is small but my kids and hubby had no complaints it would be nice if some parents of some teenagers would control their children so they dont run wild and act like hooligans but that was no reflection on the motel the staff at this motel were the best we encountered on our trip and any requests were dealt with immediately and professionally
my biggest complaints were no laundry although advertised with one and the price doesnt really make it a good value the room we had needed some cosmetic maintenance but otherwise was comfortable very convenient to seaworld",3.0

fantastic view poor feng shui room,"we stayed for a weekendour 2nd time hereand loved the view from our room of the chicago river and lake michigan huge hotel with 2000 roomsif staying on an upper floor prep for a long wait for an elevator and car downit can easily take 15 minutes to get from your room to outdoors
guest room recently remodeled is a great example of poor feng shui the kingsize bed was pulled away from its traditional spot against the wall and literally plunked in the center of the room facing the entry door and bathroom a business desk and the rooms huge window are behind the headboard mattress and bedding were good but it took awhile to get to sleepit felt like someone was going to pop through the door even though it was lockeddeadbolted

good resort feel with limited food options,"this property is awesome friendly check in and personal escort to our room rooms patio walked out to the golf course which was just too cool huge hd tv spacious room two chairs and plenty of room for activities aveda bath products are always nice this was one of the best rooms i have ever seen
staying here 4 nights was way too much because of the limited food options there is really only one bar that serves substandard cuisine and some i the restaurant menu we came in expecting several distinguished dining options but it all was blah we were forced to sculp out the surrounding area instead of doing the true resort thing by not leaving
for over 600 in breakfast lunch dinner for 2 we left feeling like the food was a ripoff and trust me it was all average you know the feel when one chef cooks for several menus
 even room service served the same menu options however room service was a life saver as it rained all day sunday food was delivered perfectly each time props to their staff for this how you deliver cold salads hot food and appropriate condiments every time and in the rain is astonishing",4.0

location location location,"wow what a city we have just returned from a 4 day break to new york staying in the hotel 41  we took advice from trip advisor reviews and so glad we did we thank you for this everything we read was true so we were prepared
rooms  they were small hardly spent time in there too much to do but cleaned everyday and fresh towels everydaythe bed linen was fresh and cleanimportant to meair conditioning unit quite noisy but we just unplugged it at night  not a problem to us we had a room to the front of the hotel which was quite noisy we asked if we could be moved to a quieter room this was done straight away for us
location  superb  right on the edge of times square  subway taxi terminal and bus terminal minutes away shops restaurants theatresbars right on your doorstep
bar  the drinks in the hotel we found quite expensive but fine as a one off at the beginning or the end of an evening it was very comfortable and had bowls of snacks on the bars to dip into
breakfast and coffee making facilities  the breakfast was complimentary continental  it was fresh bagels cream cheesejammarmalade and lots of different pastries and cakes  tea coffee orange juice as much as you can eat luverly juberly not good for my waistline would have liked to have seen some fresh fruit as a choice  but it was complimentary coffe was complimentary up until 400pm this was a shame as when we did want one it was usually in the evening so we had to find a starbucks which was obviously only minutes away
reception area and service there was always someone on reception waiting to give you friendly advice and a doorman to open the door for you and to wish you a good day all in all i would definately recommend this hotel for your stay in new york  a small friendly boutique hotel  living on the edge",5.0
new clean hotel,located about one mile south of the katy freeway just south of memorial on eldridge parkway this is a new hotel with great weekend rates on priceline remember you are close to highway 6 so you are 15 miles west of downtown safe upscale area,4.0
good hotel nice restaurant near airport,"when you arrive in la airport there are several terminals but is relatively easy to travel you need to walk out from the terminal just outside the terminal there are busstops look for busstop with a red color sign board if you want o take free shuttle bus service to your respective hotels waiting time will not be more than 1520 minutes
holidayinn la is only about 5 mins ride from the airport i stayed in this hotel for only one day but my impression on this hotel was good the staff seem knowledgeable on recommending places to visit the in house restaurant serve good food with reasonable price there is also a gift shop near the restaurant if you are traveling on budget there are some fast food restaurants just outside the hotel macdonalds is just next hotel the hotel also organize day la trip for busy travelers overall experience has been great i will use this hotel again",4.0
great stay,spent a week at the carlton in november first time in san francisco so i was a little apprehensive about previous guests concerns about the hotels location on the fringes of the tenderloin but didnt have an issue with this during our stay the carlton offers great value in a good location the staff were really friendly and i loved my room,4.0
no frills but value for money,"a very unexpected bitter cold snap meant this hotel was in a good location for running back to in a hurry whilst in the central area our first recognitition was that of extremely helpful staff especially the concierge larry 
 although coventional this hotel was essentially just a bed to stay in as it offered nothing else really except location the lobby very small just about passed for a lounge  
i definately not recommend the pigalle restaurant attached to hotel as this somewhat discredits or contradicts the simplicitiy of the place as a it was very overpriced and b the staff were pretty useless 
for the english traveller the tea and coffee making facilities were a bit rubbish no kettle tea or milk only a coffee machine which proved very awkward to move and use  my husband kindly went to starbucks over the road to get my obligitory first morning cuppa
 i would though highly recommend the cosmic diner a couple of blocks north on the same side of the road for a good breakfast  it gets busy around 103011am so try and get in earlier  this is also the place to catch the brilliant city sights blue bus hop on hop off tour 
for other eating facilities without using the highly overpriced times square area we walked to hells kitchen just over the block for an unlimited choice of restaurants and bars  
back to the hotel  i would probably recommend to others but as ive stayed in new york a few times now i would prefer to stay around the soho area where this seems to be where more things are going on",3.0
good attitude good servicegood price,we stayed fro 2 weeks on the upgraded rooms on the top floor the first room we were offered backed onto the lift shafts but this was quickly and efficiently changed a greeter was arranged to help us find our way around who was friendly and knowledgeable the tenderloin district is not an issue during the day it would be great if it was 5 mins walk nearer union square but what you save in money pays for a lot of taxis downtownwe would definitely stay here again the room even had a view and if you fill in the survey online they will offer you 25 reduction off your next stay room was fine and kept very clean thin walls not an issue on our floor it was all very quiet its not 5star but it is very good for what you pay,5.0
very pleasant will return again,"my friends and i stayed at the moorpark again this summer like last year the staff was very helpful the room clean and cheerful the beds comfortable the free apples in the lobby crunchy good airconditioning system 
this year our room was on the ground floor right by the pool so it was fairly noisy in the afternoon and early evening but quieted down by nightfall when we returned parking was easy with the extra underground parking in the rear 
 two minor things that made our stay less than perfect this time their computers were down with no internet access for another 2 weeks that didnt help us also our room was booked as a triple but initially there werent enough towels set up after a call to the front desk housekeeping arrived promptly with an armfull of extra towels all and all a very pleasant stay we will certainly return next summer",4.0
another good visit,this is our third visit to holiday inn downtown the morning and evening concierge are very helpful and courteous sean is especially helpful and friendly by now when we arrive they call us by name when we ask for a wake up call its on time ask for a cab its on time all in all a very satisfactory place to stay,5.0
very disappointing,"we booked for four nights for the end of october 12 but hurricane sandy meant that getting into ny was impossible for the first two days we had previously emailed the hotel that we would be late but wanted to keep the remainder of our reservation and received emailed confirmation that we would not be charged a cancellation fee on arrival we again confirmed that no cancellation fee would be charged despite our reservation having been cancelled against our express email request the front desk staff were very helpful our reservation was reinstated we stayed at the hotel for the two days and the location was really good given the difficulties for lower manhattan 
prior to departing we received an invoice for two nights that reflected our agreed rate however we later found an additional credit card charge which was a cancellation fee  without invoice or other advice from the hotel it has been one month since we left ny and we are still having difficulty getting a response from the hotel and have received no advice on the refund of the cancellation fee this is unacceptable service",3.0
good for conferences at mccormick place,"stayed here just last week for a few nights 
location is great if going to the convention centre which is what we were in town for but quite a distance from downtown 1315 cab fare each way you are better off driving to the downtown area and paying for parking which is way cheaper than taking a cab each way 
hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful and the hotels workout facilities are good too
this hotel is very south that said if you are in groups ok to go out at dark but i was warned by hotel staff not to walk around alone at night i guess it gets sketchy as some other reviewers have pointed out in other posts daytime you are fine
there didnt seem to be a lot of restaurants in the area but theres a great italian place that delivers called ricobenes that i ordered pizza from and it was great didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on the quality of the food there
i asked for a hotel away from the elevators and on the opposite side that the bar is on on the rec of another post due to noise which i got 
where i was situated room was quiet as was the floor and the room was very spacious quite huge actually and the bathroom was a good size with a full size hair dryer and not those rinkydink wall blow dryers that a lot of hotels have
beds were alright but not overly comfortable full size closet in the room with ironing board and iron which came in handy for getting work clothes ready in the mornings
since we were here for a conference and its proximity to mccormick place was great it served its purpose",3.0
we loved this hotel,"my partner and i absolutely loved this hotel we were trying to find an accomodation close to union square and close to public transportation the orchard was perfect we stayed in a room with a kingsized bed and it could not have been more comfortable to this day we compare hotel beds to the one we had at the orchard the room itself was clean and spacious we didnt require a lot of room because we spent most of our trip on the streets of sf if you want to lounge in the hotel you can rent dvds from the front desk but why would you better to explore san francisco
as soon as you step out of the hotel youre on a cable car line turn left and youre on another cable car line walk 23 blocks downhill and you reach yet another cable car line the main drag for several bus routes and the underground train the orchard offers a breakfast buffet that you must pay for we found it convenient though you may not want to pay the price we didnt have to deal much with the staff because we had no issues with our stay but when we spoke with them they were extremely friendly we are definitely staying at the orchard the next time were in san fran",5.0
love the donatello,"we are shell vacation club members and the donatello is part of svcs network it was really a pleasant surprise as ive always heard how small the rooms are in sfo our roomsuite was incredibly spacious with the best bed ever i also like the stereo and dvd player in the room 
location is really key the donatello is just a couple of blocks from union square and less than a mile walk to chinatown it was very easy to get around on buses and trolleys bus is definitely the way to go and you dont need to buy the 18 week passits only 150 for the bus with a 2 hour transfer for free
my only complaint about the hotel was that the jacuzzi tub was broken and apparently has been since november 2007are there no repairmen in this town and there is no pool but we were so busy sightseeing everyday that it didnt impact us in the least
staff were incredibly friendly and theyve got a pretty darn good happy hour everyday in the lounge we absolutely recommend it",5.0
great location adequate staff and great management,"stayed here with my wife for anniversary trip am spg plat but stayed on points so i will not comment on value for dollar as have no clue what rate was on our stay 
first the manager was very responsive and accomodating to certain of my requests i did receive a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolate strawberries for our anniversary from the management that was a great gesture and was indicative of how managment treated us during the stay 
the location of the hotels is great for seeing the city right next to union square station which is perfect for subway access uptow and a quick ride on the f to williamsburg if you want to see the hipsters there also perfect to walk to chelsea soho greenwhich and even midtown
room cleanliness was average for example shower curtain was quite stinky but they did replace immediately upon my request maid service however was fine and prompt
staff was adequate by that i mean they always were responsivenot overly friendly but not abrasive either 
room was quite for ny especially since hotel is on park we were on 7 which is fairly low floor but nyc noise was not an issue
so i recommend this place as a jumping off point for seeing nyc and props to the management for being so great",4.0
march 30 and 31st stay,my daugher was married on march 31 2012 at the room on main venue in downtown dallas texas we stayed at the hotel indigo in downtown dallas since only about 34 block away from the venue we had a fantastic stay they delivered all my goody bags to my guest transported us friday night to reherasal dinner about 3 blocks away and made several trips to the venue all day saturday they allowed the bride and bridesmaid to check into their rooms at 11 am instead of 3 pm on saturday so that they could start getting hair and make up ready i could go on but just note outstanding service all around,5.0
the best around,i arrived at the hotel and was greeted from the moment i got to the door all of the staff was friendly and welcoming the rooms were spacious and very clean from start to finish it was a fantastic experience,5.0
what a gem,first stay here and am loving the staff the king suite and the view of the beautiful charles clean and comfortable and even though the living room faced the interior courtyard never heard a single sound from the outside a firstrate front desk that has a cando attitude with a smile only downside is the location is odd and not an area you want to explore on foot but its easy to reach any area in bostoncambridge would definitely stay here again thank you doubletree,5.0
excellent service beautiful room we will return,a special birthday weekend had been planned  3 months in advance wanted all to be perfect  and it was front desk was efficient  personable our room  2 queens harbor view was beautiful complete with a fresh stargazer lily everything attractive  immaculate outstanding location able to walk most everywhere  enjoyed music  outdoors there on the harbor needed a little extra time  1 hr next morning before check out this was graciously granted as a special brunch had also been planned  knew we would need time to return to room afterwards  check out i have not seen customer service like this in a long long time looking forward to returning ,5.0
great hotel but bar is subpar,our stay was pleasant and the staff attentive and helpful the room was clean and spacious and we had no unexpected surprises the service at the bar however was incredibly slow with under ten people in the place it took 15 minutes for two bottles of beer to be delivered after we waited 10 minutes to place our order so after half an hour of waiting to get a bottle of beer we decided to move on to another location the sushi service was however excellent this may be a case of a single bad waitress,4.0
beautiful hotel top notch service,i agree with the previous review about missing the lobby experience but the staff rushed us right in before we knew what was happening and we were up in our room we had a great room on the fifth floor overlooking the park and in our case the thanksgiving day parade floor to ceiling windows really made a difference and our guests you were allowed up to ten truly enjoyed the experience we had a keurig in the room and complimentary waters we also had the use of a kitchen in an adjacent room nightly turn downs with chocolates slippers and robes reminded you that it was a five star experience room service was fantastic and the food unforgettable you will be spending top dollar to get a parade view room anyway why not book the best this was our fourth parade view room,4.0
already cancelled my reservation and havent even gone yet,"i recently reserved a room at this hotel through orbitz i called to find out what type of room we were getting with a bathroom or shared bathroom
i also wanted to make sure we had a reservation after reading the reviews on here
the man was very rude and said call back tomorrow i called back the next day and he said call back tomorrow so 4 days leter i called back and he confirmed my reservation for a triple room with a private bath 
well i am 4 months pregnant and will be 5 when we get to ny so call it maternal instinct but i decided to book us a room at embassy suites musch nicer for only 40 more a night 
i called hotel 31 to cancel the day after i had called to confirm and they couldnt find my reservation the man even implied that i didnt make one why on earth would i waste my time trying to cancel a reservation i didnt even make finally after arguing he sort of owned up to the fact that he had confirmed my reservation the previous day and cancelled it luckily i was able to cancel on orbitz as well 
just make sure you check and double check that you indeed have a room reserved cant say anything about the hotel quality but im tempted to stop by and visit during our stay 
i would have been really pod if we arrived labor day weekend with no reservation in an overbooked hotel 5 months pregnant",1.0
cant imagine it gets any better in nyc,this hotel is hitting on all cylinders incredible interior design impeccable cleanliness excellent service great rooms excellent food quaint location and the list could go on i am critical to a fault but this hotel has done a wonderful job strong water pressure in the oversized marble shower heated towel warmer upscale finishes it is just nonstop fantastic the soho location is tucked away and perfect there is an awesome dean and deluca half a block away balthazar across the street and the subway around the corner nonstop shoppingstrolling in soho and adjacent areas i would not say the hotel is necessarily intended for families with small children our teenage boys had a blast though just a perfect nyc experience to be had congratulations to all the hardworking people at this hotel i will certainly return,5.0
cant beat the price,"as most everyone mentioned the location is excellent since i was alone i particularly liked having everything literally steps away metro is also close i have traveled extensively and visited new york before and selected the wellington because of its price and location vs atmosphere and luxurious accommodations i was in ny to visit a family member but also want to do my own thing i researched several places to stay and could not beat the price of the wellington 
when i arrived at 930 am check in was fast and my room was ready
i didnt bring a computer but used the ones in the lobby fee just to check my email wireless is also available for a fee
my room was quiet and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom was small and old nothing fancy for sure but it had a good hot shower not lacking in water pressure a pet peeve of mine you can get a good breakfast in the hotel restaurant before heading out starbucks is across the street no lack of starbucks though along with a deli if you want to grab a yogurt or piece of fruit
the bellmen are very accommodating when i checked out in the morning they stored my bag until i returned for my flight later than evening and they arranged for a driver to the airport when i returned i discovered my flight had been canceled and rebooked to the following day the bellman immediately contacted the driver i booked another room for the night and the receptionist provided me with a fantastic room with a view thank you
when i return to new york i am definitely staying at the wellington",4.0
oktoberfest was a blast,oktoberfest at the brookshire suites was a blast i would totally recommend this hotel to friends and family the staff was super nice and provided a fun and relaxing atmosphere well done,5.0
charming hotel in the heart of downtown chicago,this hotel was absolutely wonderful the staff was unbelievably helpful and the location was perfect right near millennium park multiple l train lines great shopping and restaurants and walkable to many major attractions we loved the lobby and overall decor of the hotel it was really classic and elegant but not over the top the restaurant seemed very busy though we didnt eat there  i would imagine its quite good given the popularity the hotel is dog friendly and it was such a treat seeing our furry friends in the elevator and lobby they do a daily wine happy hour from 56pm which was a nice touch and great way to unwind after a long day or have a preevening drink in the comfortable lobby i would definitely return and absolutely recommend this wonderful gem of a hotel we got a great deal via sniqueaway but i think its relatively affordable even without a discount,5.0
great hotel i would definately recommend to friends,we had a wonderful time at this hotel the staff could not have been more accommodating we requested an early check in and we actually got it we requested a crib for our 6 month old which wasnt in the room because of the early check in but was delivered within 5 minutes of our arrival the breakfast buffet was great a little crowded but good food and everything was replenished promptly the staff at this hotel made a very good impression on us,5.0
average for a fairmont,"were president club members for fairmont hotels so weve stayed frequently the millenium property is in a good location and my room on the club floor was nice overall the hotel is nothing special and certainly not on par with my expectations of a fairmont i most recently stayed at the fairmont pacific rim in vancouver talk about a night and day difference 
i spent 10 days at the hotel in june i had breakfast in the club lounge each morning and the food was very good the lounge itself is just okay  great views but not very comfortable to sit and have a glass of wine its also small given that overall the staff was fine but didnt offer nearly the personal attention as other properties which may be due to the size of the property the housekeeping staff was great  very friendly and caring about their work i didnt try the restaurantsbar in the lobby area primarily because they were dark and not terribly inviting  felt more night cluby overall it was good but not great and i rated it average for the experience given the price",3.0
we wouldnt stay anywhere else,my mum and i stayed here for 4 nights in august during elvis week the hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many attractions and the trolley line the staff were very friendly and helpful it was nice to see a smiling face every time the lift doors opened in the lobby our room was a decent size and clean we could hear the music from beale st but it didnt stop us from sleeping it just added to the atmosphere of being in memphis the internet access was fast and we felt safe with the secure access building the complimentary breakfast was adequate and mum enjoyed the coffee in the lobby that was available day and night we would definitely stay here again,4.0
never come to mgm and here is why,"do not ever go to mgm detroit casinoyou will be extreamly disappointed and here is why
1 overall feel and atmosphere in general there is a little on par with a decaying corpse
2 99 of the food offered at the different eateries is just rancid to the core i once got an extreame case of food poisoning from eating there at the  pallette
3 i was just recently in there casino with my grandfather who is over 70 years of age went went on monday june 27th 2011 were walking around walking around gambling  doing our thingwe go down a row of slot machines that looks like a ghost town so we sit down lose 20 and start to get up
in the process of getting up i happen to look over to my right at the insescent beeping noise and see a cashed out ticket hanging out of the machine thinking nothing of it because people leave nickle and dime amounts on there all the time and walk away mad they lost or whatever it is they choose to do
so what would you do would you pull the ticket out of the machine to make it stop beeping loudly of coursethat beeping is loud and annoyingso i pulled the ticket out and looked down
to my surprise what do i see 500 and 75 cents on the ticket i say to myself wowmust be my lucky daytheres no way anyones just gonna walk away from 500who in their right mind does that so heres where people differ some say wow thats luckysome say well gee golly gosh there sally sue you should take it up to the counter
so what did i do maybe not the most moral of options i suppose but then again i didnt know there was a law in michigan that moderated someones moral values i picked it up and walked it over to the cash out machine and promptly put it away at which point we hadnt been there oo long and my grandfather still felt like gambling some more so we went up near the front of the casino
no more than 30 minutes later i was confronted by a man wearing a security badge who very nicely at first said  this is important that you be honest with medid you find a ticket laying around at which point thinking ive done nothing wrong said  well yah i did actuallythis is when the situation turned disgusting and the man became extreamly rude and very demeaning in his attitude towards not only myself but my elderly grandfather
all of a sudden im being told im a thief im lucky i dont have the police called and im lucky i dont get charged with larsony i said hold on excuse me you have to be joking i was then at that point told that if you walk away from somthing it automaticly becomes property of the casino so calmlypolitelyi tried to explain the honest mistake to the gentleman and he was not trying to hear a word of what i had to say he just kept getting ruder by the second and kept threatening the cops on me over and over so now at this point the take my id from me not sure what they did with it came back told me i was now banned from mgm casino and all mgm affilated casinosim thinking to myself  wowreallyso then the madman very rudely turns to my grandfather who was close by and tells him that he also has to leave the casino and that he couldnt cash his ticket out that he had real life money onkeeping in mind he never did anything wrong
tuesday june 28th 2011 i called up their security department and was very very quickly handed off to an answering machine to leave a voicemail to a lead investigator that has yet to get back to me
in my opinionthe situation could have been handled much betterpull me off to the side perhaps to start but maybe even before thatyou obviously saw who i was on the camerabut didnt take the time to proporly assess the situation if you had you would have seen it was an honest mistake of not knowing that mgm is the only casino with their own specialized rules and regulations perhaps by law they should be forced to put the specialized rules and regulations on a big plaque at the entrences before you enter saying that if its our and it touches anything of ours and you stop touching it its ours and if you touch it its stealing and we have the right to harass you and treat you like crap in front of a bunch of random strangers",1.0
a great stayover at lax,"this is a great airport hotel its fairly far down century blvd from lax but the van goes every 1520 minutes 24 hours you dont have to call for it or make reservations typical westin rooms very plush and comfortable from my room i had a great view of planes landing at first i thought it was going to be noisy but finally realized they had the window open once i closed that it was quiet staff fawns on you they dont have much in the way of food outlets 
as for the reviewer who complained about the hotels being isolated and there not being food around thats a bunch of hogwash likewise the complaints that the neighborhood is dangerous there is a taco bell across the road as mentioned its also a pizza hut express but just continue a few steps down century and theres a cafe at the laquinta and just on from that is a mcdonalds on the same side of the road as the westin just a few doors down is a 24 hour subway sandwich place and a few doors from that is a dinercafe of some sort you can walk to all of this in less than 10 minutes max and mostly much less century blvd is in an industrial neighborhood but its a huge busy road with lots of businesses around i felt very safe
for the kind of overnight stay between flights that i had it was ideal better than the crowne plaza because there were more fast food places around",4.0
nice location decent place to stay,recently stayed at the essex inn liked the location  it was an easy walk to the adler aquarium field museum art institute and millennium park the hotel rooms were fine with decent space and a fridge which was handy the kids liked the pool and the rooftop garden area overall id stay again it was just an average place to stay but if youre just looking for a place to crash itll be just fine,3.0
top quality,this is a lovely hotel our room on the 14th floor had one of the most comfortable king sized beds ive ever slept on the pillows were amazing  the down comforter  sheets were excellent quality everything was spotless loved the starbucks coffee in the room the staff was very helpful  accommodating even when we asked to change rooms the first room though it was removed from the elevators received reverberating elevator noise be awaresheraton parking is expensive at 45 a night we thought we would save  by parking in the city centre garage lot directly across the street the sign appeared to state 16 for overnightall day parking but the charge was 49 the parking attendant said it was a change  written in the fine print on the sign we couldnt see the fine print even after she told us just dont make the same mistake,5.0
beautiful and elegant property  so nice it didnt feel like nyc,won this hotel on priceline for a holiday weekend we were delighted with our accommodations charming hotel good location near grand central the lobby is stunning and the room was spacious and modern would definitely stay here again no problems with noise despite being right next to elevators good but expensive breakfast in the restaurant,5.0
a very good hotel,the omni berkshire is a very good hotel the location is great the lobby is nice and the service is friendly we were perhaps a little underwhelmed by the expensive breakfast we had in the hotel restaurant although one night we returned for late night smores and cocktails at the fireside the immaturity of smores coupled with the sophisticated ambience of the restaurant made for a superbly enjoyable evening the room which was a single king bed was a little on the small side with not much leg room between the bed and walls this wasnt entirely unexpected though were talking about nyc after all our room was located on a fairly low level and unfortunately we were awakened each morning by the sounds of nearby construction overall we were very pleased with our stay at omni berkshireits a safe bet in the city,4.0
good staff but looking a little tired for the price,"this is the flagship sheraton in downtown chicago with great views over the chicago river or the city depending on both dimensions of your elevation the staff were very friendly and very courteous however the hotel itself is beginning to look a little tired and the bedrooms i was in 2734 could do with a makeover for the price
the desk location is not replete with electric sockets to plug all todays gagets and chargers in and the wifi in the bedroom although 1399 for 24 hours was intermittent with the connection and kept dropping out 
this may be a feature i have seen often in this type of hotel where the capacity of the wifi does not keep up with the increase in charge for the service
the hotel is well located for amenities and is close walking distance to pretty much all downtown locations although the nearer l station at grandred is a good 15 minute walk away with luggage you would need a taxi to transport you to and from there",4.0
great place to stay,the guy that helped us check in was amazinghe made the difference for us for sure the staff were all very helpfulwe liked the location staff and atmosphere so we would stay there again thanks,5.0
we loved our stay,my husband and i stayed at the paradise point for our 10 year anniversary the resort was lush and well maintained the lagoon and beach areas provided a romantic and secluded atmosphere we were upgraded to the presidential suite and it was gorgeous we are considering coming back with our family and staying longer to enjoy the other amenities pool boat rental and bikes since we ran out of time beautiful resort in a beautiful location,5.0
give it a big miss,for those thinking of staying at this hotel due to its price and location tot he city  think again i booked this hotel for the above reasons and now regret that decision you would be better off paying a few more dollars and staying somewhere decent or staying a little further out of the city  everything is close so walking is not much of a problem rooms are small beds are like sleeping on a cement base and the smell when i arrived in my room i found hairs in the bed and somones dirty old sock on the second shelf of the bedside table  and it was not my sock dirty in other words the cleaning of the rooms is brief and not through by my view the light from the hall waywalkway outside the room shines under the gap from the the door keeping you awake and if that was not enough the noise from the traffic would wake you anyways once you did finally get to sleep i had 5 nights booked and ended up checking out of the hotel and cutting my trip short from australia just so i didnt have to stay any longer in the hotelif you are looking for a room like that described above have a grat stay i however would never stay there again this is the first time i have had written a review on here even though i have travelled aloti just hope it saves at least one other person the dissatisfaction of booking a room here only to be disappointed,1.0
for a solo traveler convenient and inexpensive,if youre traveling solo cant beat the price and location all i want is a clean bed clean shower and a place to drop my clothes at the gates of chinatown couple of blocks from market st and within walking distance of all tourist attractions including the wharf and at t park street noise was only issue looking forward to another visit and ill be back to the astoria,4.0
building a bit dated but service was excellent,"stayed here recently on business the property is conveniently located to the houston hobby airport my first impression was that the hotel is a bit dated but the staff were extremely professional
tip on the parking  its a bit crowded between the hotel and the street with plenty of parking to the west there is a entrance to the ground floor that is tucked around the back the door is operated with your room key so it is extra safe
i ate breakfast in the roomy restaurant the buffet was ample and fresh could have had a custom made omelet if i had wanted one
the room was big and comfortable the door to the bathroom was a little odd if the door was open you couldnt sit down on the toilet overall the bathroom was very small in comparison to the room itself
one final note  this hotel did not have a lot of restaurants located nearby 
id stay here again but i do think ill look around next time and see what else is available",3.0
lots of character,cute hotel  lots of character enjoyed te gated parking rooms a bit on the smaller side lack of mirrors only one small mirror in the bathroom  made trying to get ready a but complicated sharing one single mirror the lobby and hotel in general well kept and adorable for our stay the location was great the first two nights we were there we were charged 99 per night which was great price for the room  last three nights due to comic con in area price rose to 229 a night  which was extremely high and not worth the room we were staying in we should have researched our trip better and timed our trip better to avoid this busy time avoid the red fox bar attached next door both times we went to get a drink we were never greeted by a bartender or told a bartender would be right with us and no one ever showed withing ten minutes of waiting we just left also the bartender of the bar in restaurant seemed bothered by the times we came in to get a drink as well my advice great hotel if u get a reasonable price otherwise i would look elsewhere ,4.0
hilton great stay,just returned from a 4 day business trip and i must say the hotel is 1st class great checkin and super assistance from ashley i stayed on the executive level and it included the hospitality room which was great for a simple breakfast with ample variety and fesh food the room was great and very comfortable the conference was handled well and the meeting rooms many of which were hotel rooms were great the food for the conference except for one dinner was buffet style and i must say the quality was excellent great variety and flavor for all the dishes presented the location is somewhat central with many shops and restaurants in walking distance,5.0
six towels what for,"good location having had large company discount i still had to pay 500 usd pp for 1 night for a deluxe room it was airy nice bathroom showerbath toilet was separated 
the bed was way too soft the aircon was extremely noisy
in the business centre 10min internet costed 10  usd ridiculously pricey the staff was pushy even in us terms 6 towels for a single placed in the bathroom simply unnecessary 
no breakfast befor 6am even no room service before that time
no amenities no fruits water ect in the room that you would expect from such a hotel like in four seasons",3.0
my first trip to nyc  the marquis helped make it great,"my boyfriend and i just returned from the marriott marquis last night and had a great stay 
the purpose for our tirp to new york was that we attended wine spectators california wine experience event which was taking place at the hotel  so for convenience sake  we decided to stay at the marquis glad we did
our check in took a little bit but it was because we had requested a times square view but the only beds available were two double and my boyfriend and i wanted a king so  we opted for a king room that was available immediately that overlooked broadway 
this room was great we had the last room at the end of the hall 3224 king bed and a little sitting area with a sofa bed very roomy the bath was small and it was a little tough for both of us to get ready there at the same time
the room look like it had been updated somewhat recently  at least with the furnishings carpet and the bedding  but it was tired in a few areas there was a large flatpanel tv that we never turned on and a desk and chair if youre doing a little work as well i think they charge 17day for the internet  which i think is a bit excessive  but thats just my opinion
the window was on the small side too but we looked directly out at the virgin store and just to the right is 1 times square where they drop the ball on new years eve 
needless to say we were happy with the room and stayed even after the front desk called to say they had a times square view become available
i suppose i should back up the bus a bit and say this hotel is huge something like 2000 rooms and you can tell that by going to the elevator bank where there are 15 elevators crazy we never really waited all that long but there were a couple of occasions where we were jammed into a elevator with too many people  im sure we looked like circus clowns getting out of a vw a few times
anyway the lobby is on the 8th floor and thats where youll find a starbucks shopping and a restaurant and bar there is the view bar at the top or close of the hotel and it movesever so slowlybut there was a line of probably 30 people waiting and it seemed to be a big hit we had a few nice drinks but didnt eat so i cant comment on the food there is also another starbucks on the first floor as well
the first floor lets you out in every direction so its nice you dont have to walk around an entire block to go inout everything and anything you can think of that you want to see is in walking distance this is new york  so bring your comfortable walking shoes the lion king theatre is across the street as is the one that katie holmes is starring in now there were tons of people hoping for a mr and mrs cruise sighting  so be prepared for larger than average crowds in front of this theatre
if you go out the broadway door maybe youll get to see the naked cowboy this is where he hangs out ew and there is always quite a crowd around him as well
a quick tip
we had purchased a new york pass and did the hop onhop off citysights open top bus tour  which is a bit corny but it was really nice we also did the circle line cruise to the statue of liberty  that was very cool if you intend on spending a few days going to several sights i do recommend buying a pass our threeday pass got us into several museums the bus rides the cruise and the empire state building  all included in one price it was very handy
back to the hotel
they did a great job with wine specator event  we were amazed at how quickly they transformed the ballroom spaces the staff was professional and friendly and it didnt seem like we were just another event  so kudos to everyone
some people have mentioned how busy the hotel is or how busy the streets are by the hotel um this is times square if you want a peaceful boutiquey staygo to tribeca if you want to walk out your door and be in the thick of thingsthe marquis is a great base camp for what im sure will be a great new york experience
happy travels

do not stay here,the first room that they gave us had just been sprayed with something to what mask we think was a smoke smell and it just took our breathe away when we walked in everything was dated and not very clean the second room they gave us was even worse the carpet was not even tacked to the floor it had about a one inch gap there were cheerios on the floor of a room that had been cleaned and when i took the spread off something had spilled on the blanket in a long streak one of the worst i have seen it was advertised to be airport close but was fifteen miles away and the shuttle didnt start until six in the morning we just left and went straight to another hotel,1.0
great place to stay,we were looking to get away for the weekend last minute i looked online but decided to call and reserve a room at this hotel the clerk was very nice and answered all my questions when we got to the hotel check in went very smoothly the only thing was not enough parking it seemed like maybe there was a conference of some sort going on aside from that it was great the bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean we will be staying here again,5.0
loved the pan pacific hotel in seattle,"the service was excellent and we loved the hotel in general i can see how some might say the living space in the rooms is a bit small but i think the use of space and pocket door features make it work the bath room was large and had a nice sized shower and a big tub we were in town for a wedding and to sightsee so the size of the room was not a major focus the bed was not very comfortable but it wasnt too bad the service from the staff was fantastic though and we would stay there again 
one thing to be aware of is the cost of parking 33 per night parking in seattle is expensive anyway though",4.0
perfect location nice room good value,weve stayed at about five or six dupont circle hotels this one is the allaround best including the three other kimpton hotels there this location is ideal  close not only to dupont circle and the metro but also a short walk down to a good convenience store and in the marriott an illy coffee bar adjacent to the hotel lobby seating area the large room we had with two comfortable queen beds for 2 adults and one teenager worked out perfectly there was a large dividerdouble closet between the bedroom and the washroom  nice privacy with the toiletbath in their own room the staff is friendly and helpful the room was quiet although i recommend asking for a room away from the elevator which you can hear every lift if you are close finally we came in an offweek the price was superreasonable best value in the neighborhood one more tip  if you are not going to use your car during your stay and want to save money on parking try the ritz hotel nearby  they have reasonable rates,5.0

a very pleasant experience,"i stayed there with my family for four nights and found the experience to be very pleasant i was a little concerned after reading reviews of other people but because i have really paid for it already i was ready to take the chance i drove there from erie pa and i stayed near the airport because of the convenient location since i am very familiar with philadelphia it served my purposes excellently since i was away most parts of the day but also close enough to return for a short daytime stay the hotel was well kept and it was a very busy weekend which made it difficult for the breakfast area to be immaculate the room was in very good condition and the bedding is in great condition i did not have to use the shuttle but i saw the regular departures to the airport
i want to add my two cents worth since unsatisfied clients are more apt to write nasty reviews",4.0
awesome fantastic modern hotel,the highly efficient executive assistant colleen fink friendly yesenia at mission control and jj and elvis are staff members i have to mention for their outstanding service all the staff is so friendly and helpful yotel is a wonderful modern futurestic clean hotel with an excellent location and great value for money 24h cvs across the road two blocks to port authority metro 3 blocks to times square walking distance to great restaurants in hells kitchen free coffee and muffins every morning and galley with coffee machine on every floor stayed for 6 nights and couldnt be happier with the yotel it was awesome stay,5.0
great option for theatre district and touring,this property is a great option if you enjoy staying at a wellmaintained and fully modernized hotel that has served as a hotel for many years it is not a brand new hotel or a luxury property it is convenient functional comfortable spacious by nyc standards and wellequipped it is like many many hotels in the city but in far better condition than others from its era because of the standards of the hilton corporation it features all of the customary services and amenities of the hilton garden inn brand instead of the bfast being served in the hotel a french restaurant located next door and accessible through an interior walkway serves a buffet bfast to those with bfast coupons the restaurant is also offers a menu for outside patrons and hotel guests without coupons its location is fantastic for those visiting the theatre district or touring the city it is convenient to most any theatre i noted that it is also close to stops for the major hopon hopoff bus tours and the subway you can walk to times square central park lincoln center or anywhere in midtown west within a few minutes its location on 8th ave places one close to the times square action but on the edge of residential living noise level from a hotel room is typical for the city with slight addtl noise from an adjacent fire station the hotel is only about 15 stories so most views will be of surrounding buildings if your room faces 8th ave and is on a high enough floor you will be able to see the river all rooms along 8th ave provide a view of the avenue and the hustle and bustle of cars and pedestrians one negative to the 8th ave vista  you may be able to see across the street to apartments im not sure if they could see in the hotel windows but one might be best to make sure the curtains are drawn a few recommendations  check out le rivage on restaurant row for a tasty pricefix french meal trulia located up 8th about a block serves fantastic american food with a mediterranean twist monday night at birdland for open mic night is a must for a true broadway lover,5.0
renaissance hotel was great,"hugh and i stayed at the renaissance hotel when we went to see chelsea football club play the seattle sounders
we arrived early in the day  and they allowed us to check in early and get out of our travel clothes 
the concierge was knowledgable about the surrounding area and suggested some great restaurants
we ate at both hotel restaurants and found that the quality of the food was well worth the cost hugh had salmon and clam chowder  both which were execellent
we will definitely stay at teh renaissance for our net trip to seattle",5.0
a 4 star hotel with 2 star service,the location of this hilton was terrific however the following occurred i had two beds only on our last night as priceline could not guarantee bed arrangements ahead of time the hotel did provide a rollaway that was too short for someone 6 feet tall i was wrongly charged 25 for valet parking fortunately refunded by the hotel the oatmeal in the restaurant was likely made with water but still cost about 7 two hallways in the hotel were cold refrigerators and microwaves were not standard in the rooms but had to be requested hotel staff said the hotel only had 15 microwaves and couldnt understand why more werent available and a curtain in our first room was torn,2.0
excellent location for seeing san diego,not having been to san diego before i looked for the most affordable hotel in a good location it was just by luck and other reviews that i found the bay club the hotel is on shelter island a convenient location to see the sights from it is an older hotel but very well maintained our room was very spacious and comfortable you have the option of either a bay view or marina view we opted for the bay view and enjoyed watching the ships move about realize that youll be looking over a parking lot so a second floor room is best by the way its a great walking area since the entire length of the shore line is a park the staff at the hotel was excellent all very helpful and attentive and the breakfast is not the standard continental one that most hotels offer it consistently offered scrambled eggs fried potatos fresh fruit and often pancakes plus you look out at the beautiful boats in the marina as you eat a lovely place,5.0
very good value for money,this is a very nice motel conveniently located to visit the la area although its situated next to the main road pacific coast hwy it was very quiet the room was perfectly clean and bathroom looked recently renovated there was indeed a modern flat screen with lots of tv channels highspeed internet fridge and microwave but no coffeemaking facilities the staff at the reception was very friendly overall it was an excellent value for money,4.0

just a place to put your head,"my first trip to new york and i cant really complain about the hotel itself the rooms were spacious clean and comfortable the bedroom could of done with abit of an update but for 4 nights it was adequate enough we were on the 7th floor and heard no traffic noise whatsoever so a good peaceful nights sleep 
the restaurant in the hotel was nice but just as expensive as other restaurants around anyway 
the location was ok central park being the closest attraction and about a 1015 minute walk to times square 
the staff were miserable and probably the most unhelpful i have ever experienced the use of lockers were free which was great 
all in all yes if i absolutely had too then i would stay at this hotel againhowever id probably like to find a hotel that was a little closer to where it was all happening and staff with a smile",3.0
outstanding hotel  lots of hostory wrapped in a brand new look,dont normally like to stay in older hotels but the blackstone is a brand new old hotel lots of history wrapped in a brand new look rooms are completely redone and modern hotel staff was very friendly and attentive the hotel gym was larger than most i have been in and had brand new equipment the restuarant on the first floor is also very good if you can get in and dont want to go to far from the hotel,5.0

greatest stay,"my wife and i have traveled to numerous locations throughout the us and mexico i have to say that the donatello is the greatest hotel we have been to the staff was excellent especially the front desk and the concierge i have read numerous reviews and want to dispel the rumor that it was noisy yes there is a club across the street and maybe room location has something to do with it but we slept every night with the windows open and were not bothered one bit by the noise
 we are returning to the donatello in two weeks and would never think of staying any where else in san fran",5.0
avoid  dirty overpriced and disinterested staff,"so having read all the tripadvisor reviews  we were looking forward to our 6 days at the diamond head inn ok some some reviews were extremely negative  but most were very positive there lies the issue dont believe all you read
we booked into the small untidy office and collected the room key as soon as we entered the room 110 we were in total darkness and no light switch after opening the blinds and turning on all the sidelights this was at 3pm it became obvious why dark would have been better
the carpet was badly stained in several places pillows were off white with stains walls had shoe scuffs on them and the chair was badly stained its at this stage you look deeper the vertical wall radiators were filthy with dustdirtgrime on every element and the place just felt dirty even the wall picture above the bed was broken
the back door opens out to a very dubious rear footpath and the rear windows have no security on them at all rear door just has a standard lock on it
kitchen utensils can be counted on one hand
we asked to see another room that was even smaller though marginally less stained  with the staff being entirely indifferent to our issues with filth and staining
time to call hotelscom for a full refund and get the hell out of the dump
i read a lot about the wonderful staff offering up a valuable car parking space but lets figure this one out the hotel only has 4 spaces allocated to it  when it has 21 rooms the manager thinks its ok to suggest having to use parking facilities several blocks away  and yet reviewers have thanked staff for moving their cars to allow them to park
so you think diamond head is cheap think again you have to pay 795 a day for internet and will probably have to park several blocks away we got a reservation at the dana om missionary bay for the same price as the diamond head
if you have already booked or are still going to book  check the room out first also book with someone with clout who will ensure you get a 100 refund  like hotelscom
a final note  i emailed the hotel 3 times before we arrived to inquire up an upgraded room  not one email was replied to
this may be a great hotel for surf bums who will likely be too smashed out of their heads to notice the filth  but with age comes an expectation of what a hotel should be  and clean is usually top of the list
it amazes me that there are so many positive reviews for what is a dump of an establishment it has tainted our faith that all the reviews are genuine but not that the negative reviews do follow a common thread",1.0
good hotel watch the neighborhood at night,"i paid about 7500 a night for this hotel for a 2 night stay everything was within walking distance oriole park at camden yards the national aquarium inner harbor plenty of good places to eat around the inner harbor which was a 3 block walk the bad news is downtown baltimore can get be very dangerous especially at night if you walk a block or two in the wrong direction you will find yourself in a bad place even the walk to the inner harbor can at times be unsafe even in the day you might encounter street poeple in the downtown area but these issues are more to do with the city then the hotel itself
the hotel was great value for the money i paid the public areas of the hotel were very nice this is a well maintained historic hotel the lobby area looks fantastic the room was quiet clean and comfortable the only downside was the bathroom had seen its better days it can use a renovation not terrible though this hotel was great for the price and would be good even at 15000 at night",4.0
top of the line,wow this place was wonderful it was an easy and great location the whole place was renovated and its very very nice this is definitely a 3star easy it was quiet the beds are really nice and the linens were so great the staff was always very helpful and kind the pool was really nice parking easy and free honestly there is not one thing i can say against this placei was very impressed i want to stay next time,5.0
couldnt have been better,we checked in on a very busy saturday night for a 3 night stay the hotel was booked solid so it was crowded at checkin but the desk staff did an incredibile job of getting all of us handled in a timely fashion they were all so friendly and helpful the entire hotel inside and out was clean and very presentable the room we had was on the ground floor by an outer door and was still very quiet and comfortable on checkout the desk manager even allowed us to print our airline boarding passes from her desk computer on her printer with no questions asked this hotel is in my opinion a winner and should the need arise again to stay in austin there is no question it will be this hotel,5.0
a good but not preferred choice for a day stay before evening flight,i had a 12 hour wait for my overnight east coast connection and spent much time the day before my flight trying to arrange a day rate room at lax no easy task as no one has this on their website and ringing through i found most of the properties are either disinterested bounce you around from one person to the next who has no idea what you want or tell you to turn up on the day i followed the latter advice and with my luggage booked through and time to spare i took the first shuttle after 90 seconds to arrive at tom bradley  the marriott  i had a friendly helpful welcome and with my platinum elite card had a nice room on the concierge floor with lounge access and free wifi i had a relaxing day the pool area was functional but lacking any character and no poolside service which was a shame and you need to like latin american music or have a good noise cancelling headset with your own player this is an airport hotel not a resort so i was under no illusion  a couple of hours on a nice sunny day lying on a comfortable lounge bed was restorative after a 14 hour flight having stayed at other hotels nearby before i opted for the hilton deli for lunch food to take back as the boring starbucks was the only choice at the marriott for take away food and the concierge floor and in room dining had ridiculous prices the marriott lobby is busy and characterless and lacks the spaciousness of either the hilton or westin or the sheratons space comfort and ambience if i had not been given the run around on my international call the day before by the sheraton i would have opted for there for the day the marriott concierge lounge evening canapés were not only very disappointing but really bad with the only offerings a dreadful green curry chicken a canapé  and some crudités that were most uninviting i decided to head for the qantasadmirals club airport lounge instead at least the drinks were complimentary when i found i had just missed the shuttle back to my terminal i decided a bit of exercise in the early evening was in order and in fact arrived on foot just before the next shuttle  just be watchful of traffic that doesnt expect pedestrians to be crossing and be ready to run the gauntlet of smokers outside terminals also less traffic fumes on the departures level,3.0
modern luxury  incredible hotel book this one now ,all i can say is wow from start to finish this property delivers everything about this hotel 100 pure luxury i felt like a celebrity staying here  we were upgraded to a harbor suite and it was huge large living room 2 full bathrooms lovely bedroom with balcony the tv in the living room is huge  the waterviews are incredible and everything is top quality the spa is one of the best i have ever been to and the spa passes with complimentary when staying at the hotel  you would only pay for hotel services and it is open till 1000pm which is nice the pool and outdoor hot tub look nice but i think personally they should be open later at least till midnight or so currently they close at sunset we had breakfast delivered to the room each morning and it was all top quality as well  and in room dining was available 24 hours a day which is a nice touch everyone working the the hotel is extremely pleasant and the location of the hotel is wonderful would definitely stay here again ,5.0
a welcomed retreat from the overactive city,this hotel is in walking distance from times square leaving behind the overactive pace of the city it was a welcomed retreat after spending all day visiting the sights and sounds of what ny has to offer from the moment you walk through the front doors you start to feel refreshed and were greeted by the receptionists in a pleasant and professional manner the entire hotel staff was excellent including both concierges the housekeeper and the men and women taking care of the breakfast area i appreciate this type of topnotch service that seems to be done as an everyday routine versus an act put on to suffice for good service thank you hampton inn,5.0

clarion hotel lets be honestmotel would be flattery,"im a guy who travels all over the country and stays in a variety of hotels while i love the four seasons and the fairmont im fine with the holiday inn express too so im traveling from the east coast to san jose for business for a week and my wife and 2 yr old son are traveling with me recognizing that we will getting into san jose late i decided to find a hotel near the airport so we could get a good nights sleep before heading up to san francisco for a couple days of sightseeing i was assured transfers from airport to hotel would be no problem as the hotel has a shuttle 
upon arrival at the airport i called for the shuttlefirst red flag you know the board with the phone in baggage claim where you can choose from the airport hotels and call for info well the clarion was not included in the listso i called on my cell phone and assured the shuttle would be there to pick me up in 10 min and i was instructed to go outside to the pick up area45 minutes later while my wife and infant son sat in the cold and 5 phone calls to the hotel the shuttle finally showed up no apologies
so we drive to the hotel  it is not an airport hotel as far as location is involved now im not that particular but the hotel lobby is a dump the other reviews about the front desk staff trying to stick you is correct i paid 89 for rooms and anything over 39 was overpriced if youre into the motel style accomodations where there are no interior corridors or hallways and your door opens onto a walkway or balcony or where you have to haul all your luggage up stairs or if you enjoy a good prostitution ring then this hotel is your kind of place 
my room along with my business partners rooms had a peculiarly terrible smell and the staff would do nothing about it throughout the night there were vagrants walking around the grounds and at 5 am someone who did not appear to be a guest at the hotel unless it was a guest by the hour was walking around on the balcony outside our room 
while im sure if i stayed longer at this location i would have much more to write im not chancing my health or the health and wellbeing of my family and were leaving as soon as we can get out take it from a guy who stays in all kinds of accomodations dont stay in this property the holiday inn is across the street and looks like the waldorf compared to this place if youre looking for a true airport hotel  try the courtyard marriott which is right outside the airport grounds and good shuttle service  i watched every other hotel shuttle pass 3 or 4 times before our shuttle ever showed up definitely not clarion quality",2.0
very good hotel with great views and great value for money,"overall impression very very good value for money i paid 150 plus taxes

 room very big lots of space comfortable bed and clean
 indoor pool wow amazing views from the pool fairly decent sized too
 gym was under renovation so im not sure
 service people are pretty nice
 rooms are quiet so sleep quality was very good

bed bugs dont stay here,"the beg bug rumor is true although the hotel comes at a great price and a fab location to public transportation everything else about this hotel is awfull i will never return to this hotel and will tell everyone else to stay away there was obvious prostitution going on out of this hotel hookers with their pimps sitting in the car until a customer would come up and then they would go into the room 
once i got home i noticed the bites from all of the bugs i counted 27 bites on one hand alone

not planning on staying here on our next visit to nycq,"we arrived early our room was not ready and we were told they would store our luggage and we could return at 300 pm for check in we returned at 315 our room wasnt ready until 330 the desk clerk was unfriendly and did not offer us water or champagne as noted on their website 
 we booked a junior spa suite on day 3 of our 5 day stay the jacuzzi tub malfunctioned and started up on its own through out the night the front desk sent a technician at 200 am he disabled the tub and never returned to fix it we paid for this amenity and never received it we were compensated with a 1 day complimentary continental breakfast 
we booked this hotel through expedia both expedia and the hotel websites listed a guest laundry facility as an ammenity to our dismay there is not a laundry facility at the hotel they offer only laundry service a paid service 
the bathroom has no counter space and the wash basin is the size of an airline basin on a good note the bed was comfortable the hotel is within walking distance of times square shops and the subway would we stay again probably not",3.0

comfort  style,"my 4 night stay at the hotel rex exceeded all expectations here is the lowdown
location  perfect the rex is close to the theater district and union square but remote enough so that you dont feel like a tourist access to cable cars and buses is great all major downtown sights are an easy walk also the bart trains are not far if you dont mind walking 4 blocks and dont have a ton of luggage i recommend using bart to get to the rex from the airport
atmosphere  polished and serene with a european feel minus any attitude my small immaculate room on the second floor was completely silent  absolutely no view but i really didnt care becase the decor was lovely and fun nice size bathroom too somehow i lucked out and had a window air conditioner but i am not sure if all rooms have this
service  front desk staff are attentive and hardworking cafe andree has great food at surprisingly low prices even room service was inexpensive the business center is convenient no charge and my room was promptly cleaned every day
price  at 175 per night booked on the rex website i received a voucher for a full breakfast each morning and tickets to the asian art museum well worth it no regrets
lastly if i am not mistaken the chain that owns the rex maintains headquarters directly across the street from the hotel if this serves as an incentive to keep the hotel running smoothly it sure is working",5.0

great resort great golf course great new villas,"my wife and i visited in february it was our third stay in the last two years we stayed in the new villas that overlook the 1st fairway of the golf course the villas are beautiful kitchen living room master bedroom with a huge bathroom marble throughout there was a waterfall right outside our master bedroom the sound of water at night was very relaxing the golf course was in great shape unbelieveable views was fun to play wish i could say the same about my score we ate at the restaurant only once as we were spending time with friends in scottsdale the food was very good and fairly priced
the new lobby  restaurant  pro shop were almost complete which will add another level of quality of the resort we didnt spend time at the water park but everyone there looked to be having a good time
all in all we had a wonderful time and will be back again i would recommend this highly",5.0
worse than i expected,i hated this hotel my room smelled humidity the air condition is so loud the area around the hotel is dodgy and far from a subway stop 15 minutes walking the hotel and the rooms badly need renovation old furniture comfy bed the cover and blanket always seemed wet because of the humidity in the room so noisy because of the construction site in front of the hotel that starts around 6 am  hotel reception employees were ok some better than others but not that friendly breakfast is average overall it is not horrible but for the price i would not recommend it,2.0
comfortable clean gentle staffs 15min from city center,i went to san diego for busimess in november 2012 and stayed in hilton mission valley for 1 week great hotel rooms comfortables staffs always smilling and helpfull beakfast with fruits juices hot plates isnt close to the city center but if you have a car is not a trouble or if like to walk you can walk until thetrolley center and take 15 min by train thereis a tax for the internet us 90 per day i would like to stay there again,4.0
good location bad hotel,we booked 4 suites for a family reunion at over 400 a night for each room the resort seemed full which i cannot understand after seeing our rooms its what you would expect from a motel 6 that has a suite formica countertops old furniture and carpets cinder block walls we left after 2 of the 4 planned nights and moved up the coast to the st regis at dana pointe for almost 600 a night in comparison the st regis should have cost 2000 a night the bahia was nice about letting us leave early though its still hard for me understand that people are willing to fork over the amount of money for this place,1.0
needs a ton of work  caution advised,a pretty ordinary hotel i am used to staying in budget accommodation  especially on a weak dollar  but this was pretty ordinary even by those standards room was clean and the blokes on the front desk for the early morning shift and the night shift were pretty friendly and helpful that is about the best that can be said the day shift front desk bloke was unhelpful seemed more interested in his ipod than attending to guests room was incredibly noisy  so much so that i had to brave the san francisco beggars and run up to the pharmacy at midnight to buy earplugs the room had no remote for the tv and no alarm clock the hot water was temperamental at best and there is no air conditioning there is no room directory the phones have no little sticker on them to assist you with dialing out or roomtoroom so i had to run down to a pay phone on occasions needs more than a lick of paint and the elevator is so slow that its quicker to take the stairs dodgy locks on doors will take considerable work to get it up to acceptable  even complimentary ear plugs for the rooms facing geary street would be a start im sure they can be bought in bulkdefinitely would not take a family there okay for young single people,2.0
right up my alley,close to the beach if you wanted  but for me was not too far from my business meeting and restaurants close by  everything was in its place  quiet and peaceful after a hard days work  this will be my resting stop each trip to the area,5.0
beautiful old hotel brought back,my husband and i stayed here when we checked in there was a mixup with our reservation and the front desk staff very graciously upgraded us to a luxury suite for our few minutes of inconvenience no additional charge to us the hotel staff was eager to please in every way our suite had obviously been renovated new modern bathroom new windows but it had the charm and large rooms of an older hotel nice room appointments will visit again,4.0
very comfortable,"as other posts have highlighted the location of this property is unbeatable the rooms are small but comfortable with bathrooms fridge plasma tv etc the hotel has a coin operated washing machine and dryer for use and there is 1 computer for use continental breakfast entailed teacoffee and pastries a usual continental breakfast ie nothing special or fancy 
the owner is extremely helpful and attentive with anything you require the roof top is basic but a great place to relax with a couple of drinks as the sun goes down 
the hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the craziness of the venice beach stalls etc and a 2 minute walk to washington avenue there is no supermarket within the immediate vicinity apart from a small grocery type store however i guess the aim is to eat out every night anyway my wife and i hired some bikes for one of the days i think they were 20ish dollars each for a full day and rode down to malibu
we caught a bus from hollywood and it was relatively easy to navigate we then caught a bus to union station which was quite easy too",5.0
smokey and poorly managed,"the first night was uneventful check in was smooth the elevators are tiny and the rooms tiny halls are datedbut thats ok since we got the room for 70 a nightif you are from ny you wont really mind the space if you are from txmaybe you will think its tiny too  bed and bedding were great
but the real problems began the second night when the people in the room next to us were completely out of control we had to call down three times because of them running screaming and jumping then  5am someone started smoking i called down around 6 to see if the front desk could please do something about it but i ended up having to call down again a little later in the morning because of another wave of it hitting our room 
the front desk staff were nice but did not offer to let me use some fabreze or something to freshen the terrible smoke smell and they wouldnt do anything about it at one point i went downstairs to sit while my husband was sleeping just to get away from itand i told the front desk clerk and she just looked at me then she said that they are going to charge the guilty party 100okthis does nothing for me
so i called the manager who was rude helpless and really nailed the coffin down for me about this hotel simply being apologetic offering a way to freshen my room and convincing me they were going to do something about it would have calmed me down instantly but instead he was just simply rude and helpless

a hotel to be excited about,"we came to nyc so my niece can tour some of the colleges on her list after checking in at 1100 pm after a nonstop tour from los angeles to st louise mo we were tired and a bit hungry so we were delighted to find that they have a 24 hour complimentary snack bar on the 2nd floor which they also use for complimentary breakfast finding anything free in nyc is rare what they serve is not very costly to them but it has a 10 fold return on investment because we would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back the next time were in nyc
i gave it a 4 star instead of 5 for 2 reasons the reservation guy messed up on having a car pick us up at the airport  no show and the windows in the room did not block and nightlight and daylight very well so it was hard to fall asleep",4.0
good for the price,"this was a decent hotel for the price we stayed for three nights and didnt have any problems the room was neat and clean and nothing was broken the people at the desk were helpful and nice our card deactivated but the staff promptly reactivated it for us without hassle breakfast was disappointing all they had were little powdered doughnuts and bananas what the pool was nice though small and it could use a vacuuming it also closed way too early 900pm not much opportunity to go swim without children around
overall a nice stay and id stay there again",4.0
nice hotelbut beware of pricing,the hotel itself is in a great neighborhood clean quiet and the front desk staff and door men are super friendly that being said the rooms are ok but the walls are thin and you can easily hear conversations happening between floors and hallways the spa is beyond overpriced the facility itself is pretty and serene but the prices would overpower the relaxation do not rent a car from them the facility they use have too many hidden fees they do not check the car out before you use it or when you return it and by opting for a full tank of gas we were charged 72 yet were never told the grade of gas the amount of gallons put into the car the price per gallon the friendly concierge desk turned into nightmares once you check out for a little more  there are nicer hotels to stay in i will not be staying here ever again,2.0
clean comfortable room,"while the room was small and the bathroom tiny we were quite satisfied downtown hotels often have small rooms everything was clean and the bedding was luxurious 
the only real negative was that the walls were thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallway
i would stay again",4.0
marginal in phoenix,"stayed just one night arrived late into phoenix left at 8am the next morning we wanted to be in north phoenix as we were heading to the grand canyon the next morning and did not want to get stuck in bad central phoenix traffic 
it was a good 25 cheaper than anything else i could find nearby the neighborhood was quiet we felt safe the room was very small cant use a more flattering word than adequate bed was comfortable climate control worked fine got some decent shut eye room décor was passable chair in room was clean but stained and a bit beat up sink in bathroom drained very slowly as if it was 75 clogged and sink area was a bit beat up television was small towels were rough on the skin 
for this short stay the hotel worked but just barely i could see it not working for the more fussy in the world the room definitely looked worse in the light of day versus the night before when i was dead tired my overall rating 55 out of 10",2.0
great except for one thing,"i met some business associates this past weekend april 1617 at this hotel i have to admit i liked almost everything about it the location is great the fact they have a pubrestaurant attached is convenient and i think the rates are comparable to the surrounding areas 
my issue with this hotel is the parking rates it is about 50 to park from fridaysunday i am supposed to stay at this hotel again this weekend family trip this time but i am just not sure about having to pay fees like that to park my car
i will certainly provide more feedback as i learn more about this parking situation",4.0
at the end of the day its pretty good,"i stayed at the ramada hollywood near universal studios for 6 nights in the month of may me and 3 other friends shared a double room and even though we were sorta nervous after reading the reviews online we went ahead and kept our reservation well first of all this hotel really isnt that bad i think a lot of the reviews are a bit on the dramtic side 
1 the location yes this hotel is located in hollywood however it is not in the glam end of it i wouldnt call the neighborhood scary at all its just a hispanic neighborhood but we had no problems and ventured out often the metro line and busses are about 1 block awaythe hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots and there are city tours daily from the hotel i would advise buying a map before heading out 
2 the building although the outside of the hotel isnt attractiveat all the interior isnt too bad i found the place pretty clean and some of it looked a lil more modernized the room we shared wasnt a bad size we had a balcony fridge and small sofa the bathroom was a decent size and the shower was huge the hotel has an outdoor pool it is inground its not the biggest pool but it was refreshing and has lots of loungers and plants around it
3 continental breakfast every morning there was a free breakfast we all found it decent they serve cereals fruit like fruit cocktails toast bagels croissants eggs meh sausages yummy and waffles also good the eating area is pretty nice and its well maintaned and clean
4 customer service this is the only issue i had with this hotel we did have one bad expirence on monday nights the hotel bar has a comedy show well i did find the show a little amatureish but for the most part it was greatthat is until they had one comic come on he was the most vulgar rude performer i have ever seen he not only made disgusting jokes about incest rape and drug use but he picked out people in the audience and made extremelely rude comments and jokes at their expense and on top of all that all he did was yell we did end up walking out when we brought this issue up to the front desk they simply stated thats how comedy is here and to this i replied you guys find incest rape and drug use funny the older gentlemen at the counter didnt take us very seriously and shrugged us off also when it comes to calling cabs make sure to tell the front desk to call you a yellow cab the hotel cab they use there charges you more than double than all other cab companies we also found the front desk staff rude and always quick to get rid of you they dont seem to know a lot of basic questionsdirections when we asked them where malls grocery stores good bars in the area werethey look confused and just sorta mumble an answer 
this is a very honest review if you are looking for a basic hotel in a pretty central area with moderate prices than definatley book here its great for the price and served all our needs i would definatley stay here again",3.0
even the front rooms are ok,i usually request a back room but they were sold out so my mother and i settled for the seventh floor front rooms that they had set aside for us the soundproofing is quite good really you hear trolleys and saxophones outside but they also quiet down as the night moves on i still would request a back room but its the chancellor great location excellent service friendly staff so nice to not stay in a big chain hotel and also i have to admit that i love those deep long tubs wifi was worthless on my ipad but my iphone with verizon wireless worked well great breakfast just as good as sears next door which i also love,5.0

second stay even better than the first,"i stayed at the wyndham baltimore peabody court with some family members for my daughters graduation from mica the hotel has a lot of charm and we all loved the neighborhood and seeing all of the dogs in mount vernon square this stay was even better than our first stay in april the service issues were ironed out we had top notch service from the time we arrived until our departure 
starting with the valet he directed us to a very close parking lot where we saved a lot of money over the valet parking cost transportation to the inner harbor and even to fells point was easy using the free circulator bus which had a stop a block or two away the front desk staff was cordial and helpful the housekeeping was excellent too we were also pleased with the service at the bar
both rooms we reserved were beautiful and we enjoyed the views from our rooms for the price and convenience this hotel was an excellent choice for us",5.0
great location and rooms,had one night here at the beginning of a trip around new england  perfect location for all that boston offers the staff were extremely helpful welcoming and friendly rooms really good and clean wouldnt stay anywhere else in boston for value and location fine for young children too,5.0
most exceptional customer service of any fairmont hotel i have stayed at,"i recently had the pleasure of staying at the fairmont copley plaza while i was in boston on a business trip it was my first time visiting boston i am a fairmont presidents club member and have have the pleasure of staying at many fairmont properties in canada and the united states i am pleased to say that this was by far the best hotel stay i have ever had the hotel setting was amazing and the service of all the staff at the hotel was phenomenal from the bellmen the front desk attendants housekeeping and food and beverage staff i was always made to feel like a valued guest of the hotel 
one night when i was dining in the oak bar i asked the food and beverage manager where i could find a particular brand of cucumber vodka adam took the time to research the information for me and called a few liquor stores until he found a place where i could find it unfortunately when i took a taxi to the liquor store they were sold out to my pleasant surprise when i returned from my business meetings the next day there was a bottle of vodka in my room for me adam had taken the time to find out another store that sold it and went out purchased a bottle for me
this was one of the many shining examples of the amazing customer services of this hotel as a result i know that i will go back and stay here again in the future",5.0
great location,when we went to ny for the first time we didnt have any idea of the place at all so went through a travel agency the put us in the edison room was very basic and not too large but clean the location is absolutely fantastic they have a bar the rum house which is a piano bar and is a great bar even though quite small music 5 nights a week bartender at the time jose extremely friendly and helpful next time we went we booked direct and paid up front but when we got there we were told that we had been sent an email to say that there was only one room available no email arrived but the accommodated us in a doublebedded room which was far superior to the previous one we never ate in sofias but had breakfast a couple of times in the diner attached altogether enjoyed our stay especially with its closeness to times square restaurant row broadway central park maceys penn station etc  the list is endless would definitely go back,3.0
take all your valuables from your car,"no breakfast but free pet friendly
rooms with two beds are very small if you stay at the hotel during the day in the morning is veryvery noisy in eight days housekeeping have not vacuum the room even once
the rate is higher compared with the room comfort",2.0
hotel from hell,"honestly i have never stayed in a hotel as run down in poor working order and filthy as this one our first room number 220 was disgusting the list of problems are 34 inch gap between the glass and the window frame a used disposable diaper in the corner by the window used qtips and tooth picks on the floor under the desk black hair and filth on the bathroom floor a used drinking glass on the bathroom counter the toilet would not flush standing water in the bathtub above my ankle after my shower black mold ring under the ring of the toilet and around the windows partially eaten food left in the fridge from a previous guest and the blanket you could actually see through the carpet had not been vacuumed in at least a week and the room had not been dusted in a month it was worse than an old spare bedroom that had not been used in years we wiped down the room with sanitizers stuffed paper towels in the window gap to keep the cold from coming in after much complaining the front desk reluctantly moved us the next day to a new remodeled room that still would be considered a 1star room at best and nothing close to the advertisement on the website even in the new room we had to go to the front desk to pickup new towels and linins the next day and make our own bed
the breakfast area lobby and the bar was freezing cold we had to wear our coats at breakfast and in the bar
we had a big group of people that stayed in 6 different rooms and each one had similar complaints",1.0
amazing hotel and staff food not so much,we were here for a week for a confernce and really enjoyed our stay being walkers it was an idea location close to everything concierge was very helpful providing routes and tmes fourtunately she also gave us great tips to eat in all price ranges would we stay here againabsolutely would we eat here again no we are returning in nov for another week for a family event but will eat elsewhere,4.0
poolside cabanas were wonderful after a spa day,we didnt stay overnight but we did have a spa day here and that includes use of the facilities the pool and pool area were very small but fortunately it wasnt too crowded the terry covered cushioned lounge chairs under the white cabanas were amazing what a nice spot to have lunch after spa treatments the only downsides are small 1 the only restroom is inside the gym next to the spa 2 spa waiting area is tiny 3 you can call in your food order from the poolside phone but once its delivered the waiter disappears and doesnt come back to check on you or for refills still we had a wonderful time,5.0
not a great hotel,it was not the worst hotel that i have stayed in but it really was not that great a place we arrived very late at night and when we entered our room the air conditioning was not working the front desk person came up and reset the unit which worked for 5 minutes but then proceeded to stop again after the 5 minutes we had to be up for a dance competition in 5 hours so we had to sleep with the window open thankfully it was only in the 60s we complained to the front desk before we left for the day and when we got back later that night it was working the room was very outdated except for the new flat screen tv they apparently just put into all the rooms the pool was dirty you could not see the bottom because it was so cloudy the breakfast was ok it was like all hotels give you cereal make your own waffles toast eggs and sausage juice and coffee there was not enough staff on site when you called the front desk or went down to it no one was ever around and you had to wait for someone to come back,2.0
great staythis is my new place in nyc,"this is a great hotel in nyc rates are very very reasonable i was expecting the typical very small hotel room like most in the city but not here room was a regular standard size roomnice high ceiling room was very comforablewe got a king and the bed was fantastichighend pillows comforter room was clean bright and spacious i cant say enough how much value i thought we got for what we paid 
its an easy walk down broadway to the subway station and times sq is i believe 3 stops away easy easy 
book it you wont be disappointed",5.0
good option for weekend in boston,"my husband and i along with two friends chose this hotel to be our base while visiting boston for some sightseeing shopping and concert going the 5 shuttle to and from the airport was quite convenient as is the hotels proximity to a subway station the walk to the subway station is basically through a residential neighbourhood that seems decent and ends near a dunkin donuts on the other side of the hotel is a big box store plaza  target best buy home depot etc which was nice and convenient
the hotel staff were quite friendly and helpful rooms were clean and big there is no restaurant though they do serve breakfast we did not try it but bickfords nearby has a great breakfast room service is provided by a nearby restaurant and while the food was really good there was some menu confusion since they had recently updated their menu and the hotel did not change the ones in the rooms
our concert and shopping took us away from boston so we needed to rent a car for a few days the free parking at the hotel was a nice bonus to this
not being downtown you are a little out of the action and nightlife but for the price and closeness to the subway station this shouldnt matter too much",4.0
good service but an older motel,"i have to commend the staff for excellent service  they really try to do the best they can free shuttle to the cruise ship was much appreciated
however this is an older motel type establishment and the rooms are dark and furnished in an outdated 80s style it felt a bit depressing with no outside light for privacy the curtains have to remain closed it might be a great improvement if they could add some sheer type curtains that allowed daylight to enter and yet maintained some privacy
the passageways are run down and while the paint is new they need some sort of reburbishment  doesnt give a good impression upon entering
breakfast consisted of donuts and weak coffee with something that was vaguely suggestive of juice perhaps some healthier alternatives like bran muffins and a better brand of juice
the price of course was very good but could be summed up by you get what you pay for next time we will pay a bit more and try something a bit more upscale",3.0
great value but could improve,overall really appreciated the comfort of the hotel rooms comfortable and clean with sofa bed for 2 kids part of room a bit stuffy as ac far from master bed free breakfast but it is pretty basic stuff and the breads are stale and not tasty it is also a it of a mad scene with too much activity in the breakfast area free shuttle is very convenient as i goes to the major sights there is also free parking,4.0
the muse  fantastic location,"this was our first visit to new york  therefore we opted for a hotel close to times square the muse hotel did not disappoint
the location is excellent  approximately 300 yards from times square and the theatre district 2 blocks from 5th avenue shopping area and an easy stroll from macys and central park
we had an executive room which was spacious and had the benefit of a very comfortable bed and small sofa the decor is very modern and clean with a large bathroom and quality bath products
we are aware of other reviews commenting on the noise from the street we had 3 windows onto 46th street and had no problems with noise",5.0
plan to return,during our spring break we stayed at this hotel so our family could enjoy the many sites in dc the hotel was conveniently located near all the major museums capital white house and other attractions we didnt need to take a bus or subway we just walked and felt safe everywhere we went the service was also wonderful barbara at the front desk was very receptive to our many questions everyone seemed genuinely interested in us having an enjoyable stay the hotel room was clean and well maintained as well my kids couldnt get enough of the pool and we enjoyed the roof top terrace we hope to return and will definitely stay at this hotel,5.0

a good choice in a city that doesnt have many options,the atheneum is a good choice in a city that really does not have many decent hotels rooms are big and have decent beds lobby is a little dated and the staff is a little indifferent but the hotel overall is pretty good location is convenient to some restaurants in greektown and sports stadiums are very close by the people mover is a block away which makes a circle around downtown detroit for the price you probably get the biggest room in the city good choice for families who want to put their kids to sleep and close the door,4.0
in need of a facelift,this hotel room is clean the minimum standard for staying but the entire hotel is in need of repair some repairs are in progress but the quality of the repairs looks as if it has been done by jethro bodine definitely not to marriott standards and the worse marriott property i have ever stayed,2.0
not that nice,"stayed here in early jan 2004 for one night the hotel lobby is nice but the rooms need work they have old furniture and are in need of an update the staff was friendly but they were not willing to give me a room on a higher floor even with my hilton gold card i would stay here again but it is on the lower side of most embassy suites one major plus is pf changs rest which is located in front of the hotel

looks nice but lacks substance and service,"the common areas are very sleek and good looking the library bar is a great space but this is not a hotel that is luxurious or offers great customer service we stayed in a superior king room and it was pretty good except the bathroom still had an old bathtub and was small they have clearly skimped on the upgrade of the rooms  bed was pretty stiff you could see the old paint job and there is zero art on the walls 
in terms of service the front desk doesnt allow guests to borrow umbrellas in a town where it rains for like 5 months nonstop it took them 20 minutes to check us out and fix a charge on our invoice and it wasnt fixed so now i have to call them when i get home and no one was particularly welcoming our 3 day stay there plus the pump room was unable to move our dinner reservation from 2 to 4 people which is silly and tells me they dont value guests staying at the hotel 
there were two things i liked about the hotel the fitness room had many new machines and was decent sized and the people who came to get dinner and drinks at night were all well dressed it was a good scene if you stayed in the library bar and didnt hang out in the other bar near the pump room
overall id say this hotel is just a 3 star hotel that caters to one time guests and locals who will take friends and business clients there for drinks and dinner nothing really wrong with that but potential travelers should book knowing this",3.0

would definitely stay here again,we had three rooms traveling before a cruise the staff here was excellent went out of their way for you very friendly and courteous loved the rooms and art deco decor very clean and the pillows were extremely comfortable we hung out in the lobby they made us feel very much at home also very close to the space needle pikes market and the pier,5.0
returning next month,"my wife and i stayed in the rex in april 2008 for 3 nights we loved the european feel to this hotel we are now at this minute booking the hotel for another 4 nights in march 2010 i remembered the secluded feel of the hotel and the excellent local knowledge of the staff the parking is obviously not great it is right in the middle san francisco after all what do you expect however their system for parking works and you do not have to wait long
the rooms are compact not small but extremely comfortable it all adds to the intimacy of the hotel like it is a secret place that no one else has discovered yet
if you want stay somewhere that puts the customer first go for it at the rex",5.0
lovely hotel in a great location,there is no doubt that the location of this hotel is great we had a room on the 5th floor over looking 10th st i was expecting more noise based on the reviews that i had read prior it was actually quiet for a large city the bed was very comfortablewith lots of pillows the room was very clean the staff was very helpful and the bar and restaurant although pricey were very good we only had dinner and dessert the bartender makes great cocktails the nightly water is a nice touch especially when you have been doing a lot of walking overall a wonderful experience,5.0

cant wait to come back and visit again ",5.0
what a dump ,whoever came up with the phrase the customer is always right would be appalled by the service received at this hotel the staff is rude and uncaring and they seem to care more about the people who come to their pool bar then the people staying at the hotel itself imagine advertising that they have a pool and then not being able to take your kids to it because of the mtv beach party that is going onand that was on one of the few days that they actually allowed us to access the pool nearly all of their staff who interact with guests need charm school classes from the front desk staff one of whom hung up on me when we called to complain that the elevator still hadnt come after 15 minutes of waiting to the onsite managers who tell you to fill out their customer service survey as a way to voice your concerns although the common spaces are very nice catering more to their celebrity visitors then the actual hotel guests the rooms are small and sparse a waste paper basket would have been nice and the air conditioning incredibly loudif you are lucky enough to get a room where it actually works which wasnt the case for some of my fellow travelers we kept hearing were still getting the kinks out but the problems they have are with their people and the utter lack of concern that they have for their normal paying guests,1.0

dont let the pictures fool you,"hotel is under renovation there were no baseboards on my entire floor half the light fixtures in the hallway had no lights in them the vending machines were empty and the ice machine didnt work
the weirdest thingthere was no closet in the room there was a small refrigerator that we had to prop up on something to make it stand up and not tilt over the light fixture in the bathroom was hanging by the wires out of the ceiling the swimming pool was just a mosquito magnet

excellent location and huge room,"i would definitely recommend hotel contessa for people who want to stay on the riverwalk in downtown san antonio hotel contessa is located right on the riverwalk and you are minutes away from all the restaurants bars and shops on the riverwalk hotel contessa is not in the center of the riverwalk action but it is definitely in a great location also its kind of nice to be slightly secluded especially when enjoying drinks or dinner outdoors in front of the river at the hotel restaurant the hotel is also within 10 minutes walking distance to the alamo and other sights in downtown san antonio
the hotel itself is very clean with nice and modern decorations the rooms are huge each room is a suite and the rooms are very nicely appointed the bathrooms are large and beautiful as well there is free wired and wireless internet in the hotel rooms i have no complaints about my stay the price is better here than at the more central riverwalk hotels but this hotel is close enough to everything to be worth the stay",5.0
five days in boston,we visited boston just after hurricane sandy came up the coast but luckily there was very little damage done here we picked the colonnade hotel because of its location to many attractions and because of favouable reviews that we read we were not dissapointed the rooms were spacious and the beds were particularly comfortable all the staff were very friendly and were more than eager to give us good advice about things to see and places to eat we took a daylong tour of the greater boston area took a duck boat ride went up to the skybridge walked all over the back bay area and of course did our share of shopping in the many malls and shops in this area we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to others staying in boston,4.0
nice hotel in a perfect location some organizational kinks,"i stayed in this hotel while on a road trip with my mother i used some of my starwood upgrade certificates to upgrade to a deluxe room
valet parking at the hotel was easy but very expensive more than 50day the checkin process was a little disorganized we arrived around 830pm on a saturday but to my surprise there was only one counter open for this massive hotel and the spg line was closed we had to wait around 10 minutes to get to the counter when another agent finally arrived overall the checkin was smooth but the agents didnt seem certain about some of the hotels newer policies for example there is a new benefit for free continental breakfast for platinum members but no one seemed sure what it included or any of the details about it even at the cafe where it was served there was uncertainty about how to process the order and what to do with the coupon they wanted to keep it although we needed it again for the second morning
after checkin we headed to the tower where our room was the elevators ride on shafts outside the structure and are all glass which is pretty cool but they can be really cold and so can the lobby so be prepared we stayed near the top floor which was pretty cool because our room had a great view of the golden gate bridge the room itself was a little smaller than i expected but i thats what you get in most downtown areas of major cities it was certainly clean and comfortable with the normal heavenly bed and shower there was a refrigerator in the room but it was automated so you cant expect to store anything personal in there i did see a note about requesting an additional fridge if you need to store things im not sure about that process we didnt need it
we didnt need the concierge much but the one time we did the gentleman helping us was great the other team members seemed less engaging
the breakfast at the cafe in the lobby did the trick for us they had tasty baked goods fruit yogurt and coffeetea we also ventured out and waited on a huge line to get to dotties cafe down the street we waiting a long time but it was totally worth it awesome breakfast joint
the location of the hotel is perfect right in union square its within immediate reach of the street cars cable cars buses bart and walking distance of chinatown little italy and others we had dinner one night at scala nearby which was very good and at the house of prime rib which was amazing one of the best mealspresentations ive had in a long time
overall i would recommend the hotel as long as the expectations on the room size are in line and the possibility of delayconfusion at checking
safe travels",3.0
we have just left after a great 5 night,"we have just left after a great 5 night stay at this hotel we got upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite from our original booking of a 1 bedroom so were really spoilt from prearrival questions such as transfers from airport and any grocery requirements to the suggestions of itinerary the staff could not have been thoughtful enough
the location is great too breakfast was good and the possibility to take back to the residence was great for small children
only thing i would say is that if you are a very light sleeper i would suggest a bay view room north point road is reasonably busy
perfect hotel perfect staff thoroughly deserves its rating
ps there is also a small
fitness area 3 treadmills cross trainer plus weights etc",5.0
great hotel amazing city,"after reading some reviews on the site i was apprehensive but had no need to be room was big with 2 double beds bathroom small but had huge shower great location taxi rank outside and grand central station metro subway linked to the hotel bought a week metro card for only 24 when we checked out had a bill for 110 dollars for food which was not mine sorted out quickly and wiped off my credit card
statue of liberty breathtaking well worth a ranger trip around ellis island empire state queues big but had to be done did rockerfeller centre in the night and noticed they did a special pass to go up in the day and night on the same day views from helicopter out of this world brooklyn bridge  well worth the walk for the view but dont bother with brooklyn ice cream factory shopping in macys better than bloomingdales guggenheim and met both excellent movie tour well worth it  never thought the friends building looked like that what an amazing place cant wait to go back will be booking the hyatt again too",5.0
excellent service room no good entrance nor spa or pool services,"this is an excellent hotel although it is important for them to make some reforms to keep in his position
cleaning service was no very good we found dust in many places and almonds in the carpet the carpet was no clean at all
the tub in the bathroom was a bit old and a bit small
the matresses of the beds were no good i think they were quite old same for pillows
there was no pool working they told us they were reforming it
the spa closes very soon which we dont find it ok for this type of hotel category
the shop at the hotel was very poor so we could not find anything we needed
the service in the hotel is excellent in general and the room service is really good it makes you feel confortable and feeling welcomed really warmly
the entrance to the hotel is not very good cars arriving cars living and people going in and out makes it a bit unconfortable and you feel not being very secure between all this cars",4.0
great stay,ten of us stayed here last weekend for four nights although this hotel is old it is run really well by some very friendly and helpful staff from booking our stay a few months back  making some changes along the way veronica at reservations was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble  the receptionists and door staff were really friendly and helpful our suite was spotless the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean and shower very good the location is second to none next time in in new york i will stay again hopefully,4.0
awesome in every way,great location great room great service fantastic value,5.0
excellent hotel and location,stayed for 5 nights on our first trip to new york hotel is in an excellent location and we had no trouble finding our way around the hotel was of a very high standard and efficiently run our room was a good size with two comfy if high double beds we were on the back of the hotel with side views of the hudson riverthe bathroom was clean with plenty of towels shampooshower gel and body lotioni thought it was windyas we were quite high up but it was the sound of the lift it didnt cause any inconvenience though we could probably have found somewhere less expensive to stay but were warned that hotels in new york can leave a lot to be desired the menu was rather expensive but it is more fun going out to eat new york is such an atmosphoric place the only downside was that internet access is expensive but then new york as a whole is expensive,5.0
central location but not great,"first off the location in little italy is great its right in the heart of the disctrict with lots of dining options all around although none of them blew us away but we only tried a few but the first thing to know is that because its right in the midst of the action you hear it all midnight partiers dogs in the hotels central courtyard orbiting police helicopters crying babies trains and the local clocks carillontough if you really want to get a good nights sleep 
other tipsthe rooms are very small european style rooms with only a separate wc with the toilet and tubshower inside the vanity and sink are in the entry area next to the tiny clothes rack and the only appliance included is a hairdryerno iron in the room although they have them at the deskjust test it before you take it back to your room our first one didnt work and no alarm clock or radio also if you have a car wed definitely recommend reserving a parking space for 10 its worth it since the local metered spaces may be hard to come by and your coins buy a lot of time though they do take all coins not just quarters dont try to enter with a huge car though its tight
too anyone with babiesdont open the balcony door there was no actual balcony out this door and a sizeable gap between the threshhold of the door and the bars in front meant that any small child would be in danger of falling through crazy
other notes basic toiletries loudflushing toilets basic flat pillows though they do give you 4 and not much storage space 
on the plus side the locals were super nicewe were impressed by how friendly everyone in the area was have a fun trip",2.0
almost perfect stay,just returned from a 7 night stay at the palomar it is high on my list but iwe did encounter just a few weak spots the things we loved the rooms are well appointed and spacious we were upgraded to a suite extremely nice and large for a nomimal charge the basic rooms are great too it was nice to have the extra space the front desk was very helpful and always pleasant the pool area though small was very nice for a downtown location the room was clean bed great very restful after a long day  it was very nice to have coffee in the lobby in am lemon water during the day and a very nice wine reception each day fro 56pm the retuarants in the area are plentiful and very good didnt have a bad meal urbana restaurant attached to the hotel is very good too the location of the hotel is very convenient near dupont circle now for the negatives the concierge was not up to par they were rude at times very curt and were not very knowlegable one example we wanted to take a side trip to mt vernon and got poor and multiple information they need to spruce up the concierge department the only other complaint i had was that for a suite  we only had one sink  a modern above sinkvery impractical and the shower looked liked it needed a good scrub wallpaper needs freshening all in all we would recommend this hotel and would return ,4.0
they made a difference i am sold,"i had the untimely experience of getting stuck in san antonio with my spouse after a business trip san antonio not being the first place that comes to mind when spending time with a spouse for me but i have to say that we took a chance on this brand new property and had the most incredible time
a hotel stay is made of a few key elements and here is my opinion on them for this property
cleanliness without a question these people know what it means to make a guest feel that they care about the upkeep on this place there was someone on our floor cleaning everyday during working business hours there was a friendly employee in the lobby that seemed to love her job and meeting guests it was just refreshing to see that this was not an area taken for granted
location while not on what they locally refer to as the loop this property is located on the riverwalk and is just a step enough away to get some well needed peace and quiet from time to time
rooms fantastic every room is again clean arranged as a tworoom suite which is nice if you want to leave a loved one sleeping quietly in the bedroom as well as spacious in comparison to other properties
value you will pay for parking 29 you will pay for internet 10 but you will not pay for breakfast everyday nor the evening reception again everyday and while there be cheaper locations in the area the overall value is unmatched great room nice view new property free fooddrink
last but certainly not least in my book
service unmatched the valets were polite and speedy the folks in breakfast were friendly and always looking to help my true pleasure came in dealing with the front desk folk i want to commend several of them namely katlyn who always greeted us with a smile tim who was both polite and professional madison who seemed to know more about san antonio than i think anyone else on the property and then ronnie who was introduced to us by madison as her manager and i have to say this young man is a true professional he was engaging professional and personable he took time to learn about us and the nature of our trip and sought out ways to make it better than it started if this is the person who is training your team i commend his efforts job well done he made sure everyone knew our names and i felt that if we needed anything that he and his team would jump at the chance the front desk served service like it was the blue plate special and they had to give out as much as they could before the day ended i am sold",5.0
hotel helix exceeded my expectations,we were in town for a wedding and the groom recommended the hotel helix from the internet site it looked hip and fun and the room rates were very reasonable checkin was fast staff was friendly and accommodating letting us check in early and out late as we were from out of town made restaurant recommendations and arranged our transportation the room was spacious will stay there again when in dc,5.0
over 40 read this,i stayed at the hudson recently and would not return not because it was terrible it wasnt its that while it had some wonderful qualities it lacked some essential amenities the good location interior design staff hvac and a reasonable value i did not sample the nightlife but the bar looked like fun my room had two full size beds so it never felt claustrophobic the bad if youve hit the age where you need glasses it is not a good hotel choice the lobby corridors bedrooms closets bathroom all very dark its a look i know and a great one at that but i couldnt see forget applying makeup and no drawers theres a small shelving unit but i dont like my lingerie on display each time i open the door for room service and the cafeteria was very pricey for overcooked eggs benedict so although its a fun place that does many things well it doesnt score highly in some categories that are nonnegotiable for me,2.0
great location affordable friendly staff,"very well located downtown and at an affordable rate stayed at a more expensive hotel last time i was in town and the sonesta is just as every bit as good for half the price
checkin was a breeze room is clean and enough space i dont spend much time in my hotel rooms so all i need is the basics to be good and covered and they were",4.0
loved this place a bit loud from street side,beautiful place great comfortable bed big towels loved the riverwalk our room faced the street on one side but with the doors closed so it was a bit loud from the partiers and street traffic so request a riverwalk view or pool view if possible it wasnt that big of a deal we had two sets of french doors one facing the street the other facing the courtyard highly recommend and would definitely return,5.0
very modern like hotel a true courtyard in a cold city,nice amenities friendly front desk staff and good quality free coffee bed quality is so so needs new mattrees that is very importantlocation is great and close to everything a true courtyard in a cold city if your room is facing the courtyard is pretty,5.0
great service good location,"i went on a short trip to boston and this hotel was right near to the place i visited metro meeting center  i liked the rooms though they could have been more spacious bed was good and so does the other amenities 
service is the area where it shines and get high five for that be it front desk or the concierge desk guys at door or the ladies at room service they are all warm and welcoming 
i tried both the restaurants one glitch is that the bond is small considering the number of people gathers for dinner once we did not get a seat and had to go out the saver here is that there are many eating outlets around the area and they should suffice your hunger and taste buds in such case
additionally it is near to quincy market new england aquarium the place from where boston tour buses starts so a nice convenience if you intend to take a tour",5.0
huge rooms great prices,i stayed at the hotel for 3 nights last week i thought it was a very good deal for the size of the rooms we stayed in a 2 bedroom2baths the decor was a little outdated but nothing too bad it was a great location too we walked to times square several times grand central is a short walk too that was great i thought all the employees i dealt with were very kind it was a great stay,4.0
good value for the money,stayed in the kings inn san diego march 2006 the rooms were large enough to hold three adults two good sizedenough luggage for 10 days and two queen sized beds barely of course we werent planning to have dances there the room containing the bathtub and toilet is minute no dances there either so what the price was good and the place is convenient to sea world and the san diego zoo the two places we visited i would definitely consider it on a return trip it also is really easy to get to since its visible from i8 the place is clean the waffle place does a good breakfast over all it was a good deal it has in room hair dryers but no in room coffee a definite negative to my wife,4.0
very nice but feel nickel and dimed,"we stayed here 3 days while visiting some friends i dont mind the high fees to stay there it is a 5 star hotel and the room was nice enough to justify that however what i will never understand is why the nicest places charge for incidentals what does a little travel toothpaste cost them 0015 the mandatory valet parking was also a little excessive but i think in nice hotels the thing that most irritates me is charging for wifi when cheaper hotels offer it free
overall a very nice hotel as long as you dont mind being charged for every little thing",4.0
beautiful room great location and food,"this was my second time staying at the sofitel and from now on this is my choice hotel when in philadelphia from the conceirge service to the room service everything was fantastic
as mentioned before the beds are very comfy and the bathrooms have all the amenities you would need the price for room service is a bit high but good food especially the breakfast french toast
i have stayed at the ritz carlton before and was greatly disappointed being there so from now on the sofitel it is",5.0
good value best western but tough beds,we stayed for 5 days at the end of feb 2007 the local on hotel circle is great  very convenient to mission bay and mission ocean and pacific beaches to old town to balboa park and to downtown the heated pool and 2 hottubs were nice there is a little workout room not mentioned by best western listing it seems with extra towels for the pool plenty of vending machines rooms at the east side of each of the 3 buildings are near the 163 freeway you can hear traffic noise unless you run the heaterac rooms near the jungle walkway through the property ie lots of plants very nice had more tropical location ours was far from this and seemed more like a standard motel room the room was clean the tv had many cable channels though some hotels have more eg no ae hgtv or history and no movie channels only pay movies on demand the major problem was that the beds were very firm and somewhat sagging toward the middle nice place but uncomfortable sleeping there was a single computer in the lobby for guest use for the internet dont know whether there was wireless,3.0
old man rivers gem of southern hospitality,we have stayed at river inn of harbor town several times this year since discovering it based on a good friends recommendation you will enjoy the rooftop terrace which is ideal for group events we were greeted with complimentary champagne in late afternoon and each time we have stayed in a different room or suite all of them spacious wellmaintained all of the amenities you would expect in a four star hotel and on the west side you can enjoy a view of the mississippi river lazily flowing by a scene in late afternoon with a beautiful sunset in the background takes you back a century general manager karl friedrich and his excellent staff make each guest feel welcome and the hotel overall has achieved the highest standards in our judgment and we have been a few places paulettes restaurant is the inns fourstar restaurant that consistently earns its most romantic and best continental designation clearly a memphis favorite made even more memorable by our waitress donna who knows the menus by heart and guided us to some delicious grouper and salmon dishes with lobster bisque homemade raspberry sorbet they make it every three hours and a french crepe featuring locally grown plums  grown on a nearly farm on highway 51 the cosy welcoming atmosphere of the inn and its superb restaurant and staff that aims to please at every turn will amaze you and keep you coming back we have found our little escape,5.0

great hotel,"i have stayed in this hotel for one night on june 2009 i chose this hotel because it was a couple of steps away from the embassy that i wanted to go to
the front desk representative who was there at the time of my checkin was rude and kept me waiting for more than 10 minutes while he was using the phone and answering questions that seem really not important at 1130 pm while i was waiting besides that he didnt show any courtesy when i asked him about the time and place of the breakfast and he simply pointed his finger to the sign that were placed on the desk assuming that i can read english that was totally rude and uncivilized and i am really astonished that such a beautiful and elegant hotel has such a rude front desk representative one more thing that bothered me during my stay was the breakfast first i had to pay 10 bucks for a breakfast which consists of a couple of fruits and croissant that was ridiculous and i expected more from this hotel especially after paying 10 dollars a buffet probably not an american continental i would rate my checkin experience as 110 and the breakfast as 010
thank you and best regards",1.0
nice hotel good location but overpriced,i have stayed at this hotel many times as it is near a company office the hotel itself is very nice  it has more amenities and services than most courtyards do including a nice lounge area and full service menu the breakfast buffet is also very nice and reasonably priced service is always good here and in general the level of cleanliness is very good the exercise room is nice albeit small only 4 pieces of cardio equipment the location is easy to get to from national airport and it is in close proximity to the nationals stadium and navy yard but this is not an area you want to be walking around in after dark especially alone so plan accordingly it is in close proximity to a great small restaurant justinsgreat food and drinks there are only 2 things that i do not like about this hotel  the beds and the room noise i find it difficult to sleep due to outside noise entering the room and the noise made by the hvac secondly i find the beds to be very uncomfortable  the mattresses are hard i appreciate a firm mattress but dont like to feel like i am sleeping on the floor lastly the hotel is very highly priced  typically close to 300night if not for the mattresses and the room price i would give this hotel 4 stars,3.0
location location location,i spent a little over a week at this hotel i was in town for a national convention of the future business leaders of america fbla the hotel was filled to capacity the staff was very accommodating the hotel was recently renovated beautiful after visiting the other two hotels that the conference was at the hilton by far was the nicest it was located on the riverwalkat the nicest location close to the restaurants and shops the only drawback was the small pool and no place to get a coffeeyou had to go into the restaurant on the riverwalk level feel free to email me with any questions,5.0
paying for the location,"arrived in an always busy nyc and could not wait to shower and rest before tackling the city at night the dreams bed was awesome comfy and really cosy we loved it it was by far the best hotel bed ever
later that night we had to ask for another room at round 3am the noise below our window was incredible rubbish bins police and ambulance cars we could cope with out of control loaded up peeps we couldnt the noise these geezers were making really drove us crazy arrangements were made then and there to move to another room and boy we were so happy we did this room was quiet and just as cosy and comfortable
we stayed at the dream over 8 nights our last night was new years eve location was fantastic meant that we did not have to camp out times square to catch a glimpse of the festivities 
the lowlight of our stay was getting stuck in the lift for 15 minnow that was a terrible experience problem was the drinking crowds that made their way into an already cramped liftnot a good idea
we would recommend the hotel but be prepared to pay a premium due to location",4.0
stay near a strip club,"this was an absolute nightmare
nothing like having to explain to my 7 year old son why that building across the street from the hotel says nude girls and nudie cuties my wife wasnt exactly crazy about it either
so what comes with a hotel right across the street from a strip club thats right strange men and women lurking in the parking lot which by the way is way too small and filled up every night by 800 pm your other option is to park in the underground garage which is an ominous and dark desolate place with only one way in or out and youll feel like there is about a 40 percent chance that you wont make it out alive
and the rooms fairly clean but for the cigaretteburned holes in the comforter the tv with no remote control and the very strange men lurking around at all hours of the night see strip club comments above
dont stay here ever",1.0
amazingly comfortable bed and sophisticated looking room with a view of a very tranquil city with a green backdrop,it was a great stay only for a weekend but it was amazing and probably the best sleep i have every had the room was very nice and the color scheme and furniture created a very tranquil and sophisticated vibe furthermore the morning after there was a great all you can eat breakfast with the low package deal i received,5.0
just okfriendly staff in the morning,at about 60 night yes it is reasonable however reconsider this hotel before booing due to smoke smell in a nonsmoking roomalso we found an ant in my daughters toothbrush when we woke up in fairness we only saw thatt one and one on the nightstand the next morning and could not find evidence of anymore but leaves quite the bad impression  i do believe the smoke smell came from the air conditioner vent when someone would smoke outside close to it because the smell was not always present but when it was present it was as though someone were smoking right in the room the evening checkin guy was just cordial not smiling or anything but not meanhowever the morning check out guy was extremely friendly and addressed my concerns and told me to feel free to call and talk to manager about them and he put them in my reservation notes if concerns are addressed and they fix those it is a great choice for inexpensive stay thought there was continental breakfast but could not find it there is a restaraunt on site that is reasonable for breakfast but we did not try,2.0
dont let the outside fool you,i loved this little motel its not in the best area of seattle but certainly not the worst either its right on the bus line going to downtown and everything you need is close by i ended up staying longer than i intended and i was pleasantly surprised by everything the room i stayed in was really clean and new and i was treated great,5.0
one of the best hotels in seattle,"i have stayed here a dozen times over the past year and have never had an issue extremely clean rooms and helpful staff make this one of the best places i have ever stayed 
if you partake  ruth chris steak house in in the hotel happy hour is a great value and plenty of people to keep you from getting bored",5.0
clean but average,i was pretty content with our stay at the four points you can tell that the hotel is not new but they keep it pretty updated and it was very clean the room was huge and our king size bed was to die for one of the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in the location wasnt bad its right next to the highway so its very easy to get to parking was free theres also free internet but it is not wireless so that can get annoying also the shower wasnt built for a tall person if you are taller than 511 you might have to squat a little bit on our last night the heater in the whole hotel was so high that we could hardly sleep so i dont know if that is something that happens constantly or if it just was a one time incident if the price is right i would stay here again,3.0
such a wonderful hotel,the hotel the location the park across the streetwhats not to love my partner and i were in town celebrating his birthday the staff went out of their way to make our stay extra special definitely look forward to returning again soon,5.0
the bare basics leave ya with wam walking around money,i tried this place out on easter sunday 2005 when i finally found a parking place not an easy task with an suv i was surprised at how nice the front entrancelobby to this place was i was thinking  wow could i have walked into the wrong hotel how could this place be so cheap the staff was nice and sent me on my way up to my room rather quickly the elevator was very small but who cares it smelled and looked very clean when the doors opened for me on the 4th floor i was a little disappointed to find that the quilities id admired from the entrance where not throughout the hotel the halls are old narrow and creaky and when opening my door to my room i was hit by a blast of smoke smell yuck id asked for nonsmoking the bathroom was however very clean and this is important to me they appear to take care of what they have even though its old and needs updating the bed i had desperately needed a new mattress and if you need peace and quiet to sleep i wouldnt recommend this place because of its high traffic location but if cheap and clean is what you want and in the middle of it all is important id say youve found it ,3.0
nice hotel but noise can be a problem from the neighbours,"i stayed here for a conference over 2 days and received a discount rate in a king size room on an upper floor
the biggest negative of the hotel is the noise the walls are just too thin as the building itself is a bit old you can see this clearly when looking at the windows which are very old but have been sealed with new windows inside although this is great for keeping the noise outside it does nothing for the noise from those staying in rooms near you
every noise is audible from toilet flushing showers talking on the phone tv even getting clothes from the closet
my advice is to bring ear plugs if you are at all sensitive to the noise from neighbours
some other negatives involve the window shade lack of coffee in room lack of space in the fridge and for some the softness of the bed
the window shade is so old it takes like 20 minutes to open and close it it might be a small annoyance to some but it seems like something that could be fixed easily that goes for the coffee and refrigerator space as well it is nice to have a minibar and 10 free stuff for kimpton members but does it have to be so full that there is no space for anything of your own
the softness of the bed is a good and a bad depending on your own comfort and preferences i just think it is important to note here that the bed is very soft if you have a bad back and prefer a hard bed you may want to request it in advance and see if they can accommodate the need
the hotel has a starbucks attached which is a nice convenience they also offer free wine and coffeetea in the lobby at specific times of the day these are all nice amenities the tea in particular is quit delicious and strongly recommended
overall this was a nice hotel but perhaps not worth the money for a conference rate it seems appropriately priced",3.0
not what we thought,when i reserved we reserved the family room with bunk beds the person on the phone reserving the room for me said that there was a wall between the bunk beds and regular bed when we got there it was a mini wall not a full wall like described the wall papercoverings was peeling in multiple areas and had a musty old smell the pool said it was heated but did not feel like it,2.0
reliably comfortable,"the hotel was my first intercontinental experience and i left with a favorable impression of the brand
id always perceived the ic as generic professional and a tad boring  though in reality this also translates to a reliable pleasant and comfortable choice if youre after a cool vibe strong and edgy decor something quirky and unique to san francisco the ic will disappoint as too safe and bland a choice
if youre after comfortable rooms with a pleasant modern decor in a very central location with a spa gym indoor pool and jacuzzi pleasant looking bar separate restaurant all accompanied by friendly and courteous service you cant go wrong with the intercontinental san francisco and unlike the sister property you dont have to scale hills to get there 
the hotel has a corporate feel being adjacent to the moscone i imagine it would be an excellent place to stay for business meetings and conferences the front office seemed to cope well with the high volume of guests when i was checking out but the bellmans team seemed overstretched  the desk was unmanned and there were several full luggage trolleys in the lobby being attended to despite the rush the team did notice me standing at the desk and i was attended to in a sensible amount of time
having my own agenda i didnt interact with the concierge but i know the ic as a company pride themselves on their concierge service
i did not explore their dining and bar products too many iconic sf places to fit in but i appreciated the complimentary chocolates fruits nuts and water which were thoughtfully delivered
overall a pleasant stay and a hotel i would recommend to those seeking a reliable and modern hotel in sf",4.0
trade show pricing,i stayed there from 1125 until the 30th it was business for me the rsna rooms were ok as was the food at breakfast the buffet is ok over cooked bacon and eggs i would wait on the line for the fresh cooked food it is in a good location but if you are going for a family city vacation unless you get a great price i would stay at the doubletree down the block it is not worth 200 a night i paid 300 a night way way over priced but that was the trade show pricing,3.0
well appointed convenient and a nice stay,"when corporate business sites negotiate low rates im always a bit suspect in this case i was pleasantly surprised the crowne plaza was a perfect location connected to my company by a bridge with great restaurants within easy walking distance pappas and cyclone anaya and very comfortable accommodations
front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly recommending restaurants and routes
the bed was firm enough and the linens were crisp i really appreciated the little touch of a gift bag on the bed with ear plugs sleep mask and a lavendar linen spray i didnt need the first two items but got a kick out of the lavendar spray and used it mmmmm  smelled great and i had an excellent nights sleep
i ate at the hotel restairant brazos for lunch  it was resaonably priced and my club sandwich was huge  much too big to finish lunch with an ice tea tax and tip was under 17
the only thing that keeps me from giving this the highest rating is the internet connection there is free wifi on the 1st and 2nd floors but not in the rooms the room connection is free but its ethernet that meant i could only use my ipad on the 1st or 2nd floors without the 3g connection that was inconvenient and i hope future updates fix that as im sure ill be back",4.0
great birthday stay in downtown austin,"we had 3 of the evolution king bed rooms at the hilton garden inn for us and friends so we could stay downtown for my husbands 50th the room was great  loved the little earplugs by the bed they are listening and the bed was very comfy with great sheets we were on the freeway side and it would be nice if they would put in new windows to reduce all noise we only heard noise once when an ambulance went down i35 our friends were on the same floor as us 10th and they didnt hear it either although we did have fun on 6th st and not get in until around 130 so were probably not the best noise judges wed stay again in a heartbeat if we go downtown for a celebration and dont want to drive 
and the parking there is a ton of parking downtown for free on the weekend the valet mentioned it when we came in and our vehicle was fine right by the hotel",4.0
perfect location nice hotel,can not beat the location if you are in sa for leisure  it is connected to the riverwalk and close to the alamo and other downtown sites the only issue we had was bathroom cleanliness nothing major though hence one less star in the overall rating size of the bathroom mentioned in some previous comments is not a real issue unless you are seriously overweight or want to fit more than one person in it  yes it is smallish but sufficient and even has extra room for toiletries probably not in all rooms though otherwise the room was nice and modern breakfast was excellent had a problem with the inroom safe but a service guy was there in 5 minutes to fix it pool on the roof parking garage conveniently across the street your room card works to access it definitely would stay in this hotel again,4.0
a very nice luxury hotel in the heart of san francisco,"i very recently stayed 3 nights at the ritz while attending a conference at the hotel and the overall experience was very good i felt it was a good value at the rates we were given for attending the conference 
my only real complaint is with the street noise that i could hear at all hours of the day i had a 3rd story room that was located along the very steep and busy pine street i believe the windows are single pane and the traffic noise was a issue try to get either a higher floor or get a room away from pine street otherwise the hotel is pretty much what you would expect from a high end property
also with most hotels the bottled water soda and beer in the mini bar is very expensive so be sure to stock up prior to arriving",5.0
nice location basic business hotel,i stayed here for twp nights in november while traveling on business the rooms were clean and very quiet and the wifi worked well on the 16th floor the views were nice with large windows the lobby was very basic but there is a gift shop to buy basics and they have free umbrellas for the typical weather and you can print your airline boarding passes you can walk to about 10 starbucks and to pikes market and major shopping and restaurants on the water elliotts was good the only downside was the parking which was valet only and expensive and not much else nearby the hotel is convenient near the freeway too and not too far from the airport the exercise room was minimal with a few machines,4.0
what a view,"i was pleasantly surprised by this best western which i tend to think of as a fairly budget chain this best western is really an exceptionfantastic view of the space needle from my window spacious and exceedingly clean rooms warm and responsive desk staff plus the committment to greensuites is impressive
its a few blocks away from belltown so there isnt much happening in the immediate vicinity except for construction seems kind of deserted at night so i dont know if id walk around there alone at night but hey its seattle and people drive",4.0
i think it is a bit unfairly treated,"okay so it needs cleaning on the outside and okay so its not very modern and okay so the rooms could do with freshening up but whatever way you look at it you feel a bit special when you go into the entrance and lobby because it is special  thats why half of the people in the lobby are not residents they have come to stare especially at the mindblowing but expensive sunday brunch buffet
so yes it has been a rather left behind and if you want a modern hotel you would not stay here but if you like tradtional hotels with a bit of old school charm once in a while then for a night or two in the city this is a good choice id say",3.0
bald face lies,when we checked in the desk clerk seemed to change his mind about whether breakfast vouchers were included in the room we didnt get one but all my colleagues did we were given a room on the third floor overlooking madison avenue a junior suite it was dark sparsely furnished and no wall hangings at all  we were told the previous occupant had stayed for 3 months and had all decoration removed and had a shower so small the water poured out the door as you got in i called the desk and asked to be given a room with a bathtub only to be told there were no tubs in the hotel our safe didnt work we were blamed and told to read the instructions on the back of the safe door there werent any it turned out it was a broken when we complained bitterly we were given a larger suite on the penthouse floor  with a tub although it was on the front of the hotel there were no windows overlooking madison and that combined with the location on the tenth floor meant it was quiet we finally obtained breakfast vouchers i would not trust anything the employees say  and i would strongly discourage anyone from ever staying here,2.0
a gem in new york city,i recently stayed at the library hotel in nyc with my daughter to celebrate her 16th birthday i based my choice on trip advisor reviews and i was not disappointed this hotel in midmanhattan is delightful the service is unparalleled the staff friendly and extremely helpful and location fantastic this boutique hotel offers breakfast included with many choices allday beverages and snacks in their secondfloor lounge and daily receptions on their rooftop terrace the rooms are beautiful as well upon arrival the staff wished my daughter a happy birthday and in our room was a card for her along with a box of tiny cupcakes  what a nice touch overall i would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to nyc,5.0

great hotel already booked again,"we had booked for a few days to take place in the week between christmas and new year there was a snowstorm in new york that meant all incoming flights were cancelled
no worries we got onto the travel agent and rebooked the holiday flying out new years day
we got to the hotel and the check in foyer is upstairs so you get a lift upto there and we were greeted by a very pleasant man called ian stergar he advised us on what we could do and where we could go and what to watch out for and recommended some places to eat
anyway we were given a room on the 29th floor which was perfect people tend to go on about the size of hotel rooms in new york but our room was bigger than most we stay at in england it was just a superior king room but we could view over broadway and also times square so it was spectacular
we have rebooked and we are going for a week next year and would recommend to anyone who asked about this hotel",5.0
great value will keep you coming back,i have stayed at the state plaza a number of times now for weekend trips to dc the hotel is conveniently located near several popular parts of the district which makes for easy access to restaurants tourist attractions and nightlife street parking is available on both sides of the hotel the main entrance is on e street the back entrance on f street connects the second building and the hotel offers valet parking that will cost you a nice chunk per day dining is available on site if you desire to try the fare the hotel decor though wellkept shows its age but also adds a unique charm to the building that the average chain hotel doesnt have the staff is typically helpful and professional if you are looking for a reasonablypriced clean place that provides the basic amenities while you lay your head while in dc for a night or two this is worth checking out,4.0
very accommodating front desk staff,"hotel is nicely located in a quiet area of fells point within walking distance to all restaurants arrived early and room was not ready they let us park in their secured parking lot while we had our lunch nearby front desk clerk very helpful friendly professional and accommodating we were upgraded to harbor view room nicely appointed and spacious with fridge and water bottle 1 is free and 2nd one is 500

truly the best,"i usually stay at the waldorf when in ny but thought id try a change i am so glad i did this hotel is wonderful i had a truly fantastic stay there the staff are so good at their jobs its kind of shocking we ordered a car to collect us from jfk and they must have radioed to teh hotel as the recptionist  hazel was waiting on the steps for us to check us in she said you must be x and this must be your daughter x she checked us in so fast then took us up to room when getting our car on return to the airport again i saw one of the staff radio for the car so subtley they have these little ear pieces i heard him say x party on way down get car ready and its there waiting with a smiling driver beautiful spacious room lovely details like a memory card slot in the tv to watch your ny photosall room controls done by a little box by your bed you just press a button to have your room made up change the lights air con etc i wouldnt stay at the waldorf again even though ive previously loved it 
location is wonderul two blocks from the park and walking distance to lots of stufflovely fancy address and area the pool is lovely you can have your lunch up there and its seriously relaxing
im not as a rule a big fan of hotels for family stays but this hotel changed that they were amazing with my 8 year old seemed to instinctively know what she wantedall i can say is wow wow wow go see for yourself",5.0
wonderful place to stay,"we stayed at the contessa january 2024 2008 for a business meeting at the convention center in san antonio the host hotels were all booked so this was a second choice but it would definately be our first choice if we return to san antonio again the hotel is on the riverwalk 2 blocks from the convention center and very conveniently located to restaurants shops clubs and the alamo 
we found the the staff to be very attentive and helpful from the moment we stepped out of the cab there was only one minor issue with reservations when one member of our group came a day later and staff thought we had checked into that room already which we had not they resolved the problem very quickly
the entire hotel is beautiful and has an upscale yet comfortable relaxed atmosphere i met a friend across the street at the westin which was also beautiful but had a much more formal feel to it our room was on the 11th floor with a city view but we had a partial river view also it was very quiet something i was concerned about after having stayed in san antonio about 5 yrs ago and my room at another hotel was very noisy from city activity
i would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure travel if we find ourselves in san antonio this will be our hotel of choice",5.0
bang for the buck,as seasoned travel agents my husband and i were looking for a simple inexpensive room to use as our central location to see various areas around phoenix it was a wonderful experience for only about 53 per night  still within walking distance of hotels charging in excess of 200 dan the ownermanager and his wife were gracious hosts helpful  accommodating in every way for example when we returned from a day out and couldnt get a space in the lot dan moved his car to enable us to access a parking spot on hotel property has any other hotel manager done that for you lately the breakfast though modest gave us a good send off each morning and the rooms were spotless microwave refrigerator and wireless internet were added bonuses all in all we came away with a very positive feeling about this property especially in light of the economical rate would definitely stay there again in the future emily,4.0
great hotel,"on our recent trip to nyc we chose to stay at the dream downtown in chelsea it is a fantastic hotel in a great location easy access to the restaurants nightlife and shopping of chelsea and the meat packing district right across from the chelsea market and also close to the west village the hotel itself has a very cool vibe i mean where else can you sip on a cocktail in the lobby listening to great music and see up into the pool thanks to an acrylic bottom and the club up on the roof phd has amazing views of the empire state building and the midtown skyline 
as for the rooms they are very nice and comfortable we had a room with a nice view similar to the view from phd it was very chic and modern but very warm and comfortable at the same time 
service is great everyone was very friendly and not too cool for school really my only complaint was it took too long to flag down a cocktail waitress on saturday night hopefully they work on increasing the wait staff because people were at least 3 deep at the bar",5.0
good value for ny,the affinia dumont is nothing flashy but provides a reasonable value and location for new york downside lobby are is tiny no room service no wireless in guest rooms and the physical condition is getting a bit tired positives reasonable room rates and good sized rooms small kitchen are is great for any exrended stay location is walkable to broadway time square etc and close to the subway the noise level is good decent exercise facility and the attached restaurant is pretty good and much cheaper than most of the other ny hotels i have stayed in overall i would stay there again if i were in town for multiple days and could make use of the kitchen,4.0
clean great pool and friendly staff,"stayed for 4 nights on a trip to a friends wedding 
staff are very courteous and extremely helpful and accomodating anything we needed we simply asked reception and it was done cleaned our rooms everyday aircon works really well all the time
some great drinks deals in the onsite barrestaurant on certain days
sure some of the decor is from the 90s but that is the vibe of the city 
must do for memphis spend a night on beale st approx 23 taxi from the hotel checking out the blues bars also ride the tram during the day along the river and get off on second ave to take in the architecture of the city
dont forget to introduce yourself to the captain of the bell boys zach he is famous in these parts and has many helpful suggestions if you want to see any sights or eat somewhere he was great for organising transport etc i nearly forgot to mention he is 90",5.0
a great hotel,we recently spent four nights in this lovely hotel the service is happy to see you wonderful the doorman and desk clerk were friendly and helpful our room was clean and quiet one morning we ate in their small restaurant and the breakfast was teriffic i recommend this hotel without reservation,5.0
very comfortable and family friendly,we stayed at this hotel just one night before departing at the san antonio airport early in the morning the 24 hour complimentary shuttle was a blessing we were able to turn in our rental car the night before and the shuttle picked us up before check in and took us back to the airport in the morning the room was spacious and comfortable with a small refrigerator and all standard features we were also traveling with an infant and toddler and had no problem accommodating the travel crib provided at no charge as well as the fold out sofa bed for the older child the only complaint was that the bathroom had an odor like it was stale or mildewed but after getting settled in our room it wasnt disturbing enough to request a room change we were on an upper floor but the first floor rooms balcony open up to the pool courtyard which would have been really cool in the summer,4.0
sahort stay one night,we are regular users of this hotel on our way to and from europe make good use of the free car parking and shuttle service,5.0

great family hotel best not to bring car,we stayed here for a family vacation and had a great time the hotel was clean and the staff was exceptionally accommodating the rooms were old but clean although the carpeting looked like it had seen better days usually i prefer newer hotels but they kept it clean so it met my requirements the amenities were great the breakfasts were satisfying and the cheese and wine every night was an added bonus the 24 hour coffee and hot tea was another plus the location was fine for us we walked almost everywhere but we dont mind walking several miles for dinner or access to restaurants our only complaint there is no parking and although they offer on weekdays to move your car every 3 hours its not ideal our recommendation is to use public transportation or walk,4.0
great location bad smells,the powell hotel is situated in a great location with shops restaurants and the trolley literally a few steps away access to muni and bart is also nearby the lobby of the hotel is quite nice and conveys that this place is dignified and contemporary and yet also historical the customer service very cordial hard workers was excellent and the accomodations fair for the price we paid unfortunately we did not have a great experience with our room the room 401 reeked of stale urine and the shower fixtures for hot and cold water were problematic i would return to the powell hotel but not stay in 401,2.0

dont stay on the third floor,"the hotel is across the sfreet from a car repair service thats open 247 you can hear hammering in the middle of the night i was on the third floor facing 38th street it was memorial day weekend and the hotel was full or we would have asked for another room 
other than that the room was clean and the employees were very pleasant",3.0
ugh get me out of here,"i booked this hotel on hotwire when it was still owned by hyatt somewhere between the booking and the stay hyatt dumped it and hotwire downgraded it but i didnt know that until i got there 
it was awful our first room had a gurgling toilet and dead bugs in the bathtub they moved us and though that room was at least working there was absolutely no privacy we could actually hear the entire conversations of the people in the room next to us and they even asked us to be quiet as they opened the dresser drawers it sounded like they were in our room very disturbing 
i called hotwire after less than 9 hours in the hotel and asked for a refund and a new hotel i got both 
dont waste your money here its not good",1.0
classic but cramped,stayed three nights related to the rims conference in boston location was good and had what you would expect from a historic hotel quality of furnishings tv and bedding you would expect from an omni my main complaint was that room was very small and bath was tiny this was fine for one business traveler gone most of the day but would have been crowded with two people for a weekend service was good and room service ordered came in a timely manner and was tasty,3.0
iconic but is that good enough,"we stayed 5 days at the waldorf and really had no cause for complant
the doorman the concierge the check staff are all what you would expect from such a renowned hotel
we stayed in a deluxe suite one bedroom one loung room  two ensuite bathrooms 
which was a free upgrade from what we had booked
the rooms themselves where spacious  decorated in a manner befitting the period 
the bathrooms though old in style worked well so again no complaints
no free wifi in the room and only congested ie unusable free wifi in the lobby 
the hotel is huge so there is a lack of personal intimacy that is evident in smaller boutique hotels and there is a hefty price put on the extras ie phone calls mini bar meals wifi
i get the impression that people are going to go there just because it is iconic hence the hotel does not have to try to keep or attract new patrons subsequently you can probably get better value for money elsewhere in manhattan you are paying a price premium to stay at an icon however they did adjust our bill when we complained about a us50 new york to la phone call so they are still geared toward customer satisfaction 
would i recommend it
yes just to say you have stayed in it but it is not that special to justify a prolonged stay
there are better cheaper lessiconic options available",4.0

a very nice quirky hotel in the old part of philadelphia,"the kimpton hotel palomar is in the centre of the city in an old district which has some lovely buildings including a very old baptist church next door to the hotel the hotel is a well refurbished 1920s building given a modern funky interior decor with some of the wonderful original features retained such as the second floor lift lobby the staff are very helpful and informative which is just as well as the room was devoid of any guide to the hotel and its services there is a charge for the wifi but if you logon and join the kimpton in touch program which is free the wifi is free too i guess its a good way for the hotel to build its marketing data base
while the public area decor is funky eg art works such as a sculpture of little men abseiling down the wall of the lobby our room was slightly minimalist with a bed tabledesk and desk chair but no other chair and no teacoffee making facilities it did however have a minibar and you are given the key to this  this explained why the inside of the cabinet was quite dusty  the room maid does not have a key to the minibar cabinet
the evening winetastings which are free were quite popular with all the guests and a nice touch which we greatly appreciated the reception staff were very helpful in arranging a limousine hire for us as well as a river cruise and talisa in particular was extremely helpful in assisting us to sort out some difficulties we were experiencing with our westpac bank by scanning and email our passports to the bank for us
a really cool place well situated and very nice one wed certainly recommend and would look forward to staying again ourselves",5.0
good location for chase field and us airways center,sheraton phoenix downtown is a great location spot if you are visiting an event at the dbacks baseball field or us airways center suns basketball or convention center seems to be a good safe location  did not see many police nor did we ever feel unsafe or worried about being out after dark this is irrelevant for some i suppose because i do carry a gun at all times so i never feel unsafe the good news is that az is open carry and concealed carry friendly for those of legal age and not licensed to carry elsewhere just note that the venues mentioned above are offlimits for guns food choices are limited downtown but there are a few gems within walking distance if you dont mind the  price range restaurants there is a subway einstein bagles starbucks and hooters right there around the hotel we did not eat at the hotel restaurant which looked decent but pricey access to freeway is convenient and a short hop in a car to neighboring areas 20min gets you any kind of food style you want traffic does bunch up at rush hour though so plan ahead the hotel itself was a nice typical sheraton very accomodating friendly staff with good condition bldg underground selfparking was slightly pricey 17night but cheaper than east coast or west coast places and convenient the lot is open to public so it does fill up with nonhotel visitors and can force you to park a block and a half away in an overflow lot late at night rooms are modern with nice hd tv setup and bathroom facilities we did have a slightly sagging bed in a dbl room which was reported there is only one water fountain in the hotel and its on pool deck az was 113f while we were there and i was shocked that such a place didnt have water fountains therefore rely solely on bottled water the pool was small but good for kids and family to cool off wifi is ridiculously overpriced 1224hr period this is wrong wifi should always be free for registered guests if you want free wifi the lobby has a signal at no cost to guests but who wants to sit in the lobby and do computer work that should be free in your room really sheraton come on the other odd thing about the hotel is that there are 2 elevator routes and only goes to the parking garage  the other goes to the floors in the high teens and 20s inconvenient ridiculous design not a bad place but just little quirks and of course my pet peeve which is to charge guests for internet access,4.0
great location,the views were fantastic and its location could not be better but our room could definitely use some updating carpet was worn out furniture outdated our lamp shade and the wall behind it had red stains our shower head and the inroom safe were not functioning properly we politely asked the front desk to send someone to our room to fix it but that never happened we just ignored the issue for next 5 days since i feel i should only ask once and it gets annoying when your simple requests are being ignored i would give this hotel another chance because of its location but the response to service needs to improve,3.0
a towering absurdity,"first the nearly impenetrable crowds of times square tourists make entrance to this hotel an exhausting challenge if you were always hoping to see times square you should know that it has become little more than a gigantic outdoor mall  a sunglass hut here gap across the street olive garden down on the corner but youve got the energy and the nerve hey this is ny and youve made it inside you wait with a dozen other guests now 15 now 21 for the elevators to your room or to the checkin desk which is on the eighth floor the wait is as much as 15 minutes since the computer system that controls the elevators tends to crash when it gets busy and its always busy here  there were three conferences going on simultaneously when we were here and that was less than usual youre grateful when john shows up in his red doublebreasted jacket to excort the now highly impatient crowd to the freight elevators  past the stacked chairs and dusty cases of hotel water bottles johns nice enough everyones nice enough here and he says simply that this is what happens here when its busy thats what the waitress said when she tried to deliver our breakfast 35 minutes late but dont worry theyll comp it when its late theyre used to it things here are always late now youre ready to check out you stand on the 33rd or 41st floor for 10 minutes 15 minutes as the crowd grows bags in tow waiting for an elevator to stop at your floor slowly the awkward banter goes silent the humor is gone and someone goes to call from the nearby emergency phone theyll send someone soon theyre very nice  theyre used to it here the crowd grows on a floor above the alarm rings uh oh someones having a worse time than you but at last an elevator stops at the floor ten of the more ambitious of you squeeze on hope that alarm doesnt have to ring and soon youre downstairs thankful to have made it out alive wait on the 50 person line for a cab no thanks well just walk up to eighth ave and hail one ourselves

great hotel great location,"our stay here was totally unexpected we were in boston for something else and having a great time window shopping in all the designer stores and while having a drink in the hotel bar a great place with a huge drinks menu and great food when we decided we didnt want to go home i asked about the rate and was told 329 when i asked if they could do any better i was immediately given a rate of 249 our room was on the 25th floor and was a corner room we had amazing city views and two entire walls were windows my only issue with this hotel was with the tv of all things the cabinet holding it was in front of one of the windows and because of this i guess it was not very tall this made the tv at a weird low angle even though it was a flat screen the picture was not very good and surprisingly there is no free tv everything is pay per view and then not many choices i thought this was odd since i cant remember staying hotel that didnt offer free tv channels the bathroom was small but it was very clean and since it was only one night it was fine our bed was a king size and was one of the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in the pillows were great and normally i cant sleep on hotel pillows 
the location to everything cannot be beat at this hotel i will need to be in boston again just before christmas and am already planning another stay at this hotel to do a little shopping and check out the shops all decked out for the holidays",5.0
more history than luxury,"certainly not a luxurious place and as far as i could see not even extensively renovated still a list of things i like about this hotel could get lengthy heres a few
location location location our room overlooked the grounds of the alamo walk to everywhere nice big outdoor pool was wellkept historic old bar complete with moosehead and teddy roosevelt atmosphere beautiful little garden perfect for relaxing with a book lobby areas decorated with period furniture and old photos note to the manager a few big old potted palms would really finish the look 
and every morning stepping off the elevator and hearing the 30s  40s music piped into the lobby areas billie holiday stardust a small thing but a perfect little touch that made me smile every time
unfortunately our room was in the new part of the hotel functional clean nondescript and not all that new either we would gladly stay here again but next time we will request a room in the old historic section",4.0
ignore the naysayers,"we booked this quite a long while ago  but as i occasionally checked tripadvisor i saw a fair number of negative comments and was concerned as to whether wed done the right thing

used the market most nights  very useful facility

not worth the price and watch your bill,at over 325 a night for the week i expected a pretty nice hotel i was embarassed at the conditions of the hallways to the rooms it made me feel a little uncomfortable re safe just walking the hall to the room once in the room i couldnt believe how small the king room was and there was no view  even for the 19th floor there is a dresserworkdesktv stand unit on one side the bed on the other and a chair between them that you had to turn sideways to get into the bathroom was so small you could almost use the toilet and shower at the same time dont have high expectations when you stay at this hotel and youll do fine however watch the menu bar as they will charge you every day if you or the maid bumps the tray it automatically hits your bill whether you take anything or not its supposed to allow you to pick up something and look at it for 20 seconds before billing you i didnt use the minibar at all and got charges everyday anyway try to get a completed bill when you leave the clerk refused to give me one when i checked out and indeed they hit my cc for some more menubar charges after i left i wont be back at this hotel and will think twice about doubletree since the clerk said it was corporate policy not to provide a completed bill if doubletree cares the clerk was working 629 at 615am and should be fired for his rudeness,2.0
location service rooms hall,"i and my husband stayed at the roosevelt hotel in january 2012 for 5 nights and we had an excellent stay the hotel was beautiful the room was very good and service was very good the hall is outstanding we found out many movies were filmed in the hotel location was excellent just a few blocks from times square and two blocks from grand central station easy to go everywhere in ny
there is a computer where guests can check in their flights for free
there is a starbucks cafe in the hall for breakfast in the morning  in the evening it turns into a bar
there are lots of elevators 6 as far as i remember so guests dont waste time waiting for the elevator
i was so afraid about the small rooms size in new york after reading many reviews that i decided to book a superior room it was beautiful comfortable and good sized it was silent too
for sure we had an excellent time at the hotel",5.0
as usual tip top,stayed here for 9 days coming back to the peninsula after 3 years was as it has to be the welcome back greeting the service the summer special upgrade to an executive suite awsome bathroom with a view on michigan avenue the environment and not to forget the service special mention for reception and concierge who had always a listing ear and ready to make your stay as confortable as you wish so for me it was good to be back if you want a hotel without negative surprises with a stable level of very good quality of service do not hesitate try out also the food from the shanghai terrace or the lobby yes i skipped avenues because i did not want to have dinner alone but i tried it out previously and it was good the peninsula is may be not the cheapest around  but pricequality it suits me perfect,5.0

good value for money,i have been using this place since the early 1970s i returned for the first time in about 20 years oct 2009 i was afraid i would find that it had suffered maintenance wise since my first visit in the past it was only for merchant seamen but now is open to the public but seamen are able to use the rooms without bath for 45 per night a real bargain in manhattan the staff are friendly the place is clean and the rooms without private bath are nice enough i never had trouble finding a clean toilet and shower across the hall the corner rooms have private baths and are still a bargain rates singles 70 to 100 doubles 90 to 120 the higher prices are for private baths which should be reserved as early as possible seamen can get good discount from these prices the place is quiet and respectable and since it was opened it has been strict about guest conduct since seamen while ashore have a bad reputation in that area there is a nice chapel on the ground floor and coffee and donuts on the mezzanine in the morning the neighborhood is nice and quiet but it is only two blocks to the subway on 14th street,4.0
excellent service really good staff,i have to say that all of the staff we dealt with were very helpful and unusually for a newyork hotle in my experience friendly the hotel is very well situated 5 min walk from times sq and close to a couple of metros stations our room was perfectly nice with a very comfy bed and clean nice decor dont expect skyline views as it is not a tall hotel,5.0

great for business meetings,"im sharing this review mainly for others coming with business groups our company was very pleased with the renaissance i have high expectations for this brand and they definitely delivered giving our group a competitive rate and great service the staff went out of their way to make sure that everything was just perfect for our meeting rooms
reception upon arrival was very welcoming and i had no complaint about the rooms we had dinner the first night in the hotel and our waitress was great she even remembered what kind of wine i had had the next night when we went down for drinks before going out to dinner
breakfast buffet was reasonably good the first morning but nothing spectacular got a coffee from the starbucks in the hotel later on and the young lady serving was very nice
as you would expect from a renaissance hotel the lobby ambiance was perfect and we just enjoyed sitting in the lobby and other common areas during breaks

great location great fun great staff,"theres a lot of choice in san francisco not least determining the area in which to stay having decided what the hell im a tourist so dont be ashamed to do the touristy stuff i put my trust in the tripadvisor reviews which rate this hotel so highly and was not disappointed in the slightest i booked the a discovery awaits package which included valet parking breakfast at the blue mermaid chowder house and cable carbustram passes i upgraded our room in advance to a king bay view room on the grounds that several reviews complained the rooms were on the small size so i cant comment on the standard room  however i can highly recommend this kind of room although it is pricey be aware that the view is partial and certainly not uninterrupted however the room is large spotlessly clean and full of quirky touches colours and furniture staff were absolutely delightful made us feel so welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble breakfast was fine  of course you can get better but it was included in our rate and was well cooked with friendly service parking is expensive if not included in your rate the powellhyde cable car turnaround really is close  in fact it was under our window less than a two minute walk from the front of the hotel
im sure there are many excellent hotels in sf we took a chance with the argonaut and it delivered on every level it was so refreshing to stay somewhere where you didnt feel the interior designers had borrowed the holdiday inn decor guide even the themed vegas hotels can be formulaic in their layout and decor some may find it a bit ott  we thought it was cool and well be back",5.0

mr manager  please dont yell at me but it really did get very hot one night even thouth we had the window open and the fan on im aware that it is not your fault but the street artist with his saxophone did get a tiny bit annoying after a while

it was pretty good but some minor flaws,"stayed at the obrien during a weekend trip with my daughter it was very closely located to the riverwalk which was extremely nice the staff were very nice and incredibly helpful it was easy access on and of the highway and to major attractions the hot cocoa machine in the lobby was the best as was the breakfast
 downsides were the room was so small with no closet or area for clothes was hard for to people to move around in no room in bathroom either the door abutted the tiolet and was hard to close the door lock to the balcony was extremely hard to shut had to pull up on the door to get it to lock paid 1000 a day for parking is that standard procedure or did i get taken by the front desk guy 
 over all it was a great place to stay wouldnt recommend it with children though because not big enough with them",4.0

nice hotel great location wonderful staff but incomplete rehab,"weve stayed at this hotel many times over the years and really appreciate its convenient location and good value despite the fact that it was a bit dated and worn we were very encouraged to learn that the hotel had recently undergone an extensive renovation and this was our first time back in the new environs the updated decor is very smart and attractive however our mattress did not reflect the renovation as it was extremely saggy in the middle provided littletono support and did not make for a good nights sleep we had hoped that the increase in rates would be reflected by an overall increase in quality and would like to suggest that the owners invest in higher quality mattresses 
otherwise we do appreciate the friendly and helpful staff and the convenient location",4.0
stylish and convenient,"i stayed at the palmer house for two nights during the chicago marathon the hotel is huge and beautiful here are the good and the bad
good
1 location  great location you can walk anywhere you want to go and public transporation is nearby
2 room  our room was very large it was a room with two double beds
and we could have placed two rollaway beds in there and still had plenty of room to walk around
3 beds  the beds were extremely comfortable they were the most comfortable beds ive slept on in any hotel
4 service  the concierge was very helpful with luggage answering questions and finding taxis if we needed them
bad
1 no microwave or refrigerator i think some rooms had them but ours didnt
2 phone  you had to pay for any call made
3 internet service was not included it was available at a price
4 other services such as the fitness center were only available at a
price
overall it was a great stay",4.0
not a great start,just checked in and so far i would say it is the worst room i have ever stayed in the room spells like vomit and too much cleaning product to try and cover it the hotel is booked out with no available rooms to change to hopefully after this repulsive night they will be able to change our room but so far i would not stay here again,3.0
great base for looking around san francisco,"like many of the reviewers we found ourselves in the beach road property  does anyone actually get to stay in the main building and if so who are you
the walk from the main building wasnt too bad although we had just been traveling for about 12 hours and had loads of luggage the smell from dennys in the lobby is not great but you kind of get used to it not enough to go and eat there our room was on the third floor at the end of the corridor facing onto the street though this rarely caused a problem during our stay
the room was reasonably spacious and importantly clean the shower was good and the bed comfortable the internet access was wireless and free and that was important for us we were just minutes away from the whole fishermans wharf area and had good access to transport systems if we wanted it the hotel was just what we needed as a base for looking around san francisco",4.0
always a gret place to stay,once again my husband and i stayed at the club quarters in boston ma for the weekend as always clean and very comfortable rooms in a quiet and great location in the city close by to the waterfront and many tourist attractions there is a nice pub on the property which serves great draft beers and good food  including breakfast as resonable prices but above all the front desk staff go the extra mile for their guests always helpful freindly and will do what it takes to make every guest feel more than welcome over the many years that we have stayed at this hotel we always look forward to seeing the staff those include michael beverly and jason  all wonderful that work there will return soon,5.0
nice hotel very clean and cozy,i stayed just one night and was very happy with the accomodations the room was small but adequate and wifi was great quiet and cozy close to several great restaurants including serafina which has outstanding food at a moderate price the restaurant on site was fine for breakfast and cost was okay there were snacks in the lobby which was a nice touch i drove into philly so i had to park my car around the block in a parking garage with a reduced rate hotel discounts the ticket when you check in no valet and no onstreet unloading in front of hotel i had to call the hotel while driving around the block to determine where the parking garage was located check in was fast at kiosks if you prefer to waiting in line they set up like boarding pass kiosks in the airport staff was pleasant and helpful if i go to philadelphia again i will stay at this hotel,4.0
very pleasant stay,"the hotel was built on 2010 and was very clean and had a wonderful atmosphere the staff was nice even when we asked to switch rooms because the flip lock on the door was broken the pool area was clean as was the entire hotel rooms were tidy and well stocked though it seemed the ac kept resetting itself because it got warm hot breakfast was wonderful too 
the location was minutes from a grocery meijer and target",4.0
great service and fine facilities,was treated with respect did not have to wait more than 2 minutes checkin was a pleasure and parking was easy the room that the conference was held had all of the latest ammenities the food in the hotel was excellence as was the service i would stay there again even on vacation,4.0
handy and comfortable,"i booked direct with the hotel online and they were always happy to answer any questions beforehand via email from australia when i was checking out different places to stay it was this promptness as well as price that sealed the deal for me to book there is one place in beverly hills that im still yet to hear from after almost a year
location  this is a great hotel if you want to be central to the walk of fame chinese theatre etc it is located in a dead end street that leads directly to the hh centre you will hear some traffic noise in the morning from trucks going to the hh to deliver loads etc but it wasnt too bad we had the room on the front floor directly facing the street and it didnt bother us you are a short walk to the train station to go to universal and very close to the magic club
the room  we had a one bedroom suite with one bathroom off the main there is a little kitchen off the dininglounge area it came with basic equipment needed for cooking and has a full ovenstove plus a microwave and fullsized fridge there is a futonstyle lounge that folds out to a bed but it is nowhere near big enough for two children to sleep comfortably so we had to pay extra for a fold up bed for our other child there was some noise from other guests coming and going as we were at the end of the stairs to the first floor but it doesnt last long as they were passing a big flat screen television and dvd player is also supplied in the lounge plus another tv in the bedroom cable tv was included
the hotel  we took advantage of the free internet available at the public computers downstairs in the lobby there was a great rack of brochures to help with planning tours etc the reception was ready to help with booking transport to the airport and tickets to attractions breakfast is supplied off the lobby and is basic coffee juice donuts toast yoghurt etc the food often went quickly but the lady seemed to keep an eye on it and it wasnt long before it would be topped up disposable platescupscutlery were supplied so we would take our food back to our room or eat at the tables outside there is no other place to eat the breakfast there is no laundry available at the hotel so you have to pay to send it out or look for a laundromat 
i would definitely stay here again",4.0
thanksgiving stay,took the family up to view the macys thanksgiving parade and decided to try this hotel out due to its location to the parade route not bad the overall appearance was excellent and very clean help was very friendly and attentive reserved a 2 queen room and asked about a better view other than the back of the hotel  was informed that the 32nd ave view was reserved for single bed accommodations this hotel is located on korea way so if you are looking for good korean food  you are staying in the right place now the only downside i would say would have to be the size of the rooms im guessing that from the end of the queen bed to the front of the dresser would be no more than 3 feet a little tight to say the least and the beds would take up app 85 of the room with that being said if you are looking to stay at an affordable clean and comfortable room and dont plan on staying in your room for long periods of time other than sleeping  then this is an option that i would recommend,4.0
unforgetable we will sure come back to this place,my husband and i went to the georgetown inn for a weekend get away we had a blast time just went fast so we need to come back again hotel is sooo clean the beds are very comfy and the food at the restaurant downstairs is to die for love it everything is on a walking distance lovely place,5.0
best nyc experience ever,blue moon hotel was just what we were looking for to celebrate a californians 40th bday the accomodations were perfect the ambiance was flawless the staff was amazing andy  francesca were great to us we had such a great time that we are planning another 40th bday visit september 2010,5.0
charming cozy hotel with mediocre service,my wife and i checked into hotel burnham on thanksgiving day we actually had a wonderful view from our 8th floor room of the parade on state street first impressions were that the building was beautifully restored and a true landmark beds were clean great view and great location across the street from the main marshall fields and a block from millenium park the room was quite small but we didnt seem to mind the desk would be a joke if i had had to use it so im not sure id recommend this hotel for the business traveller the hotel emits charm and grace with simple touches like real keys and a minibar filled with fun creative alternatives to standard fare as for service it was sufficient but lackluster the bed had two lousy pillows and i requested two more housekeeping left them on the floor outside my door im a bit of a clean freak so that didnt fly with me but it is to be expected what do you think they do when youre not looking anyway the concierge made reservations at the park grill over in millenium park a nice stroll away from the hotel the restaurant was a bit of a disappointment good enough but in that strictly generic cheesecake factory sort of way breakfast at atwood cafe was worthwhile ill write off any lack of service to the holiday the hotel was an incredible value for chicago and its location its charm and its clean comfortable rooms made for a memorable stay,4.0
great location excellent staff,i went for business the hotel is in the perfect location for business and shopping and dining overall the best thing was the staff  very friendly remembered my name responded to requests quickly and changed my room when i didnt like the one i was in more about the view than anything else the hotel is due for a makeover  its not that its old its just a little lacking in style but i was told that would happen in the lowseason i liked how unpretentious it was and how friendly people were bed was firm sheets were fine not excellent cotton but not terrible and the tv moved on the wall to adjust to my viewing needs room was spacious i would go again  the price point is right on for the level of hotel  it felt like it was priced right in the middle to low end of the kind of hotel it is only downside too few elevators,5.0
the price of pampering has gone down,"my wife and i stay here whenever we plan to travel from clt douglas airport this hotel has terrific rates especially if you are a hhonors member and takes excellent care of their guests
we were particularly drawn to this hotel as they offer a park n fly program as well as great rooms and very comfortable beds room service is excellent and the staff are very courteous
give them a trythe airline flight crews stay here too",4.0
excellent service and facilities  i was wowed,"the lax westin was a very pleasant surprise its not in the best part of city actually most of la is not the best part of that city  but this property was an oasis in the middle of the bustle the staff from the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping teams and everyone in between was exceptional 
my only complaints were that this is not a part of town to walk around and get some air in but hopefully the businesses will help renovate the area my other is that the only restaurant  the daily grill  which has exceptional dinners offered a very overpriced and underwhelming breakfast menu no one should pay 20 a head for breakfast other than that the westin itself is a fantastic option for any business functions and has a great open bar and seating area for socializing and networking",5.0
recommend the hotel to other people,"last week we returned home 
we stayed in four season hotel ny for 3 days 
we really enjoyed it 
the hotel was with plenty of space and not far from the subway
the rooms are spacious and with a lot of light
the hotel is of high standard
clean facilities good excellent for our purpose 
we simply enjoyed the stay and it was excellent positioned for our points of interest
the hotel was very good for the money paid exactly what you need from a hotel 
we will go there again
in the future we will recommend the hotel to other people",4.0
superb customer service great room fantastic bed  one of time magazines places to stay,"i trawled for a long time on line to find a place in chicago not knowing the area there were a lot of positive reviews for the hotel blake and the free wifi was the final clincher for me from the moment i checked in the experience the experience was fantastic
ian  katherine on the front desk did everything they could to make my stay as enjoyable as possible recommending great places to eat as well as things to do as a side note the architecture boat tour they recommended was amazingly informative and a great way to see the city
the room itself was bright airy great big windows and a fantastic view of the stock exchange  the sears willis tower  a great desk to take advantage of the free wifi very reliable to seek out more about the windy city thats also how i found out time magazine has this as one of its top 5 places in the city
my few grips were the wedding guests on the saturday night were a little noisy but probably no worse than ive been after a wedding and the hotel bar is only open till 9pm but theres a couple of nice bars in the neighbourhood that more than made up for that
with all the main cta lines nearby and great customer service it made my first trip to chicago a very memorable one",5.0
loved staying in soho and hampton inn was easy access to all of nyc,this was our first trip to nyc and we were warned to stay away from times square  too crazy especially at night soho was perfect great shops restaurants and bars safe walking at night close to other great neighborhoods and the hampton inn is only steps away from the canal street subway station which leads you to anyplace else youll want to go in manhattan the breakfast was generous and impressively healthy the staff were very friendly and helpful,4.0
great location but,"first thing i will say is that the hotel has an amazing location for anyone who is travelling to ny and for that alone it is probably worth staying at the hotel but being honest there was little else that would make me stay there again
on arrival we checked in very easily and quickly and went to our room to get showered and get out and experience ny just a note but we carried our own bags through the main door and to our room without the offer of any assistance which was fine but i was a little surprised on our way to the room the corridors just felt small and a little claustrophobic and to be honest they were a little shabby at best the staff were cleaning and the cleaning trolleys and bags probably added to this but for the duration of our stay there were cleaning bags and supplies lying around at all times and it didnt look good we got to the room and were immediately disappointed with the size and cleanliness and it was freezing cold we turned up the air con and had showers but the room was still freezing and having checked the windows found one of them broken and the blinds and shutters in poor condition we decided that we were going to ask to be moved and to be fair they moved us without any trouble even taking into account we had showered and our first rrom would need to be done up again our new room was as small as the first but we decided to make do and thats what we did but its not something you should have to do the bathroom was tiny i could put my left hand on one wall and my right hand on the other while trying to stand in the middle of it in order to open the door i needed to step back and have the toilet between my legs so the door would open and i could get out the shower was good and there was no problem with the hot water the pipes were extremely loud even when we werent using them the bed was very small too and the covers on the bed not great it was comfortable though the view from both of the rooms we were in was awful but that wasnt too big a concern
on previous visits to ny we have stayed in the westin and the sheraton towers and while i accept that we paid more for both of these hotels they were much much nicer hotels and the rooms were far superior a proper bar in the hotel would have been nice too on the website there are two images for the primary lounge which makes it look really nice but the truth is the first image with 4 seats at the counter is all there is too it thats the size of the bar and it is located beside the check in desk and right beside the main enterance its not really a lounge its more a counter beside the check in desk
we didnt have any food at the hotel and there was no room service available
everyone says you dont spend time in your room when in ny and thats very true but i think i would prefer a little more comfort
as i get to the end of my review the next question is would i recommend the hotel and honestly im not sure
its location is great the customer service was very good but we were disappointed on arrival with the rooms and the general cleanliness
i guess i would recommend it but only for its location and i would warn about the roomsize",3.0
manchester grand hyatt san diego is not set up to handle small events,"being this hotel is one of the few grand hyatts in the united states i expected top notch service from the time the contract was signed until we left the hotel after the event i did receive great service from the staff on site however the planning and implementation of the event could have gone a lot smoother
the areas of note are below
1 beginning two weeks prior to the event i requested the beo 23 times via email and phone call from our senior catering manager and finally received it days before the event after reaching his assistant
2 the av order was finalized only 2 days before the event because i couldnt reach the av department and the senior catering manager on our account didnt take initiative to coordinate the basic av needs for us
3 when arriving the room was setup incorrectly  nothing close to what was indicated on the beo 
4 i emailed our final guarantee 3 days prior to the event and my contact confirmed receipt  however failed to communicate that to the banquet team because upon arrival the room was set for 3x as many people 
5 we were the only group in house with the exception of a large convention on the other side of the hotel  however our room placement was in the far corner of the ballroom so our attendees had to walk to the end of the ballroom to find us 
6 our registration desk and meeting room entrance was located right next to where psav enters their offices there was no concern on their end to not allow the door to slam nor did they consider turning down their radios when nearing our room psav reps entered and exited the door allowing it to slam each time approximately 30 times throughout the day  this was very disruptive to our event because you could hear their commotion over the presenter
7 the meeting concierge validated our parking for the day  but failed to mention that the validation we received was good for only 3 hours since wed parked on property longer than the maximum allowable time we had to pay the full valet rate of 38  meaning the 3 hour validation became null 
i have been a meeting planner for over 15 years and have not been this disappointed with a venue ever i do not plan to return to this facility and will probably steer clear of grand hyatts all together with a little more organization and planning on the hotels side these things could have been avoided",3.0
a great place close to action unique for the right price,"the clift is a treasure of san franciscos past we had a great price for only 175 and it was worth it at that price the rooms are small especially the bathrooms the room was spotless
clean and the linens so refreshing compared to other hotels
white linens we stayed on the inside part of the hotel so there was no noise the lobbybar area is happening at night and seems to be a under 40 group our rate of 175 included breakfast which was so fresh and the atmosphere was wonderful no ice machines you must ask it by room service
check their website and maybe you can get a great deal
i would not pay 300 for the experience have fun and enjoy sf",4.0
acceptable stay again,we stayed here again for one night to attend the ny international gift show the checkin staff were friendly and efficient our room 1140 north tower was large and clean the furnishings were a little worn but acceptable the airconditioner worked better this time we had to ask the front desk to turn off the message light on the phonei couldnt get it off i also asked them to repair the deadbolt while we went to dinner but this repair wasnt accomplished during our stay the concierge wasnt very helpful in finding a restaurantwe were told just to walk down 9th ave but overall the hotel is a great findboth for value and location,3.0
surprisingly nice and very nice bed,i havent stayed at a howard johnson in a long time but enjoyed this stay very much the room was very clean and the front desk was excellent the king size bed was very comfortable and a dream to sleep on,4.0

incredible historical hotel,we had made a reservation for this hotel 2 mos in advance for our anniversary and the person making the reservation stated that we would have an instant upgrade due to our anniversary upon arriving we found out that it ws never put into the computer system that way and they had no more upgrades for us it turned out good because they brought us a refrig to our room disregrding all that we had a very nice stay very helpful and accomodating we really enjoyed our stay although we didnt eat at the restaurant due to other previous plans they look gorgious and beautiful they sent us a letter apologizing about the mistake and that we would have a free upgrade to use within a year we will be going bak and staying there this hotel is centrally located and we could walk to anywhere we wanted gray line picked up in front of hotel so we could take all the tours lots of ammenities and yes we will stay there again,5.0
great location and elegant hotel in new york city,this beautiful hotel has been restored to perfection the rooms are comfortable but the best thing about this hotel is its location very close to grand central near the park and the subway so that getting anywhere in the city becomes accessible easily the room rates are not exorbitant which is unusual in nyc when the hotel is in a great location,5.0
excellent business hotel the best staff team i have ever encountered,"i have spent much of the last 3 months at the hilton garden inn it is well laid out clean and quiet and as a business traveller it has more than i would normally expect but without doubt the staff shine their close knit teamwork results in the highest levels of service to their guests
rooms  i have stayed in the normal rooms and the suites both types are spacious clean and comfortable and have all the amenities i require the suites are divided into two areas sleeping  lounge separated by the bathroom they have two flat screen tvs settee armchair coffee table work desk free internet wifi  wire table lamp ergonomic chair very few hotels have these and it really helps when youre working there is also a microwave coffee machine fridge iron and ironing board the beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet the bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror good water pressure and plenty of towels 
you can request a room exercise kit if you dont want to go to the gym and an exercise video a great idea i keep promising myself that ill get around to asking for one one day the swimming pool is out the front of the hotel it is a good size and has a jacuzzi it overlooks the carpark but youre not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is it is clean well maintained and there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas
the hotel is set back from the freeway but very little noise can be heard mostly guests are individual business travellers and many are regulars or here on longer stays so its relatively quiet 
breakfast is a buffet with a really good choice and excellent value for money 3 or 4 types of milk including soya to put on your choice of a dozen different cereals half a dozen different fruits always a large bowl of strawberries a good selection of yoghurts oatmeal pastries bagels 6 varieties croissants plus a cooked breakfast buffet with bacon eggs hash browns omlettes waffles etc free newspapers at breakfast 
room service  good choice good quality and good value for money 
lounge in reception  nicely laid out feels homely even though youre just off the lobby comfortable to sit and work if youre here on weekends plus there is complimentary teacoffee available all day
there is a small shop selling all those things that you might have forgot or if youre on a longer stay run out of such as hairspray toothpaste etc also has wine salads microwave meals if you want to cook your own cold drinks etc
hotel bus  a real plus the hotel run a free shuttle bus service to anywhere within a 5 mile radius they take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis to come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when youre ready to be collected its like having a personal chauffeur they will drop  collect you at restaurants shops memorial mall wherever within the radius 
staff  you can stay in the best hotel in the world but if the staff are haphazard or surly then your stay is marred or even ruined ive travelled all over the world and in an average year spend 150180 nights in hotels i can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams ive ever encountered i wont name them all because im bound to miss someone but when you have nancy or lala starting to worry about whether youve returned to the hotel at your regular time or when the breakfast team give you a hug then you know that the team really do care they all take a great pride in their work in looking after their guests and they really do work as a team hilton  take note your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team
downsides  of course there are some
 air conditioning units can be a bit noisy and draughty they are next to the bed but if they were at the other end of the room it would be better
 makeup mirror  would be good to have a magnifying mirror but its not a big deal
 room safe  plenty of space to put one so would be good to have
 inroom coffee facilities are good for coffee  but not good for tea tea needs boiling water and it shouldnt be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste you can tell im from the uk an inroom kettle would be great and im sure if i had ever bothered to ask for one it would have been immediately forthcoming",5.0
nice hotel perfect location,"we arrived in the hotel and were helped by a very friendly intern kathleen she gave us room 657 a fairly large room with a cosy bathroom both of them clean everything you need is there the only thing we didnt have was a view room was located on the inside of the building this room was quiet during the night no street or other guest noises the hotel has a retro feeling with thick carpets and old fashioned wallpaper
the pool is located in the middle of the hotel and has sun during the afternoon ideal for a quick swim to freshen up
the hotels location is perfect next to union square two blocks away from the cablecar turnpoint lots of restaurants and shops hopon  hopoff buses stop nearly in front
overall we had a nice stay and would recommend this hotel to everyone
only drawback is no free wireless internet but there are starbucks and mcdonalds which do have it closeby",4.0
noisy and not a good nights rest,we planned to use this hotel as a midnight 3 am east coast time to early morning departure and figured it couldnt be that bad as other motel 6 nights have been fine not so as stated in other reports the hotel employee was behind glass when we checked in after a late flight at 1130 pm i cant hold that against them but there were problems with the room  specifically the door would not close without a lot of effort resulting in a loud noise for my west coast daughter who was still sleeping when we woke up also the outlets in the bathroom did not work at all limiting use of hair dryers and normal needs for charging cell phones laptops etc but the worst was a local train that passed frequently during the night using sustained loud enough to wake us all horn blast as it passed by the highway intersection i would not recommend this hotel as there are other phoenix low cost hotels that would likely be a better choice,1.0
your one place to stay in san fran great service great views,we were looking for a place to stay where we had the option to cook in to be able to have a short walk to many attractions and had great views of the city this is it we absolutely loved this place short walk to the waterfront ghidadellis next door and cable cars right at your door but the best was the unique deck on the roof  super views and a great place for coffee in the morning and drinks at night staff was kind service was super  they are always looking for ways to make your stay enjoyable you can trust the suites to make your visit the best ever  we wont hesitate to come back here again,5.0
wellington hotel  close to most things,the hotel is very well located on 7th ave between 55th and 56th street just some bocks away from times square central park apple store and all the other shops as abercrombie  fitch etc on 5th ave the room we had was small but had windows in two directions and we could even see central park from our room a bit old fashion style but functional if you dont intend to stay at the room during the visit,3.0
pretty typical highend hilton property,"geez with over 1000 reviews i dont know what i can add how about some practical stuff
my room seemed large although the actual room itself was average theres a huge bathroom and entryway that make it seem really big everything was clean and you get a lot of extras such as robes and slippers to use while youre there bath includes tub and separate shower with wc in its own well closet the heavy door to it closes automatically and its kind of claustrophobic in there i had to ask for a doorstop to use while i was there to prop it open i used the wired internet and it was plenty fast and free tv was the best ive ever seen in a hotelhd on virtually every channel and tv was properly set for widescreen reception everything worked fine and was comfortable and luxurious 
they brought a usa today to my room on weekdays but on weekends i discovered i could ask at the desk or bellstand and get a free chicago paper even on sunday love that 
on the downside like others i found it a little irritating to take one elevator up five floors then have to completely cross the lobby to get to the room elevators ive seen this arrangement before but never with the elevator banks so far apart also lobbies and hallways were cold
eating directly across from the front desk are double doors to a corridor connecting to the mall below take the elevator at the end of the corridor down one floor and theres a big food court with plenty of cheap food if you proceed down through this mall you can come out on michigan ave however if you exit the rush st side youll have to circle around the hotel and then go up a bunch of stairs to get onto michigan ave next door to the hotel is a bucca di beppo across the street is a cosi there are lots of other things in the neighborhood one night i went about two blocks north and one block west and had a good meal at m burger i think it was as you can tell im all about cheap informal food 
transit two blocks west down grand is the red line your key to chicago you can also catch all the buses on michigan avenue 
all in all it was a good experience and a good hotel it was well worth the discount price i got for it on priceline",4.0
all the comforts of home,to have a trader joes around the corner from your hotel knowing that a frig and microwave await you in your room makes the stay so much more relaxing you can either snack in your room or walk across the street for a decent pizza at pizzeria unoduo michigan ave just three blocks away and the trains just four blocks away makes the location ideal staff is accomodating front desk pleasant and helpful rooms absolutely spotless easy and efficient climate control in rooms did not try restaurant  did get busy in evening  so cant be all bad internet service spotty and unreliable  probably because of traffic,5.0
clean and warm,i would have to agree with the other reviews about this hotel we stayed here because we just couldnt pass up the price since all we would be doing was sleeping there the rooms are clean and warm just your basics though do not expect anymore than that we had a clean bed with cable television a dresser closet nightstand and a refrigerator the staff was extremley friendly and very helpful i never once had a problem with people using the bathroom when i needed it it was also cleaned every morning its not a gorgeous hotel but it works for the budget minded traveler i will stay here again on our next trip to ny,3.0
some positives and negatives,"i stayed at park plaza during a conference for a week a few things you should know before you bookthe location is right in the middle of everything so getting on the t subway and walking is the best way to get around we rented a car which turned out to be a big mistake theres no self parking at the hotel and valet is 46 a day there are several nearby public parking garages but you need to park a few blocks away or find a spot on the street expect to spend about 4050 a day on parking and just finding a space may be a headache and a half
second thingthe hotel is historic and may not be as new and shiny as some others the lobby is dark but looks clean and updated going to the rooms its clear that the building is quite old there was paint chipping off the walls in the bathroom and a few rust spots the bathroom is so small i had to straddle the toilet to dry and curl my hair not ideal for women who like to do a little fixing up the rooms are quite small and average we had one big problem with our room overallit was very stuffy and warm the air conditioner wasnt blowing out much air we told the front desk who promptly had someone come up to fix it the air blew out fine and cooled off the room for a few hours before it stopped and got warm again they gave us a box fan which had to be on for a comfortable nights sleep thats not quite what i expected for 250 a night 
nextgood location for a conference the rooms are spacious with plenty of comfortable seating for those long days coffee and snacks were available at all times with a good selection finallytake advantage of the concierge desk if youve never been to boston the people there are very friendly and can fill you in on a variety of things to do there we went to a patriots preseason game cape cod and a red sox game theres lots of fun to be had in the area but dont expect it to be cheap as far as where to eat theres plenty of restaurants within walking distance but dont expect a mcdonalds or burger king mostly sit down restaurants there is a dunkin donuts and starbucks about 2 blocks away",3.0
ignore the negative reviews,"after reading some of the negatives on this board i was a little concerned about my win on priceline
check went very smoothly  we did have to return but was very quick
room was extra large  by nyc standards
view of chrysler building from the 36th floor was a great view would have preferred a times square view but hey i got this room on priceline and wouldnt expect the best room to be allotted
a nice touch was when we returned at midnight and there was a security guy checking room keys  made us feel very secure
i will definitely book the millenium for my next trip very centrally located steps away from times square",4.0
great place to stay in san fran,"we picked this hotel because we wanted something nice but didnt want to pay an arm and a leg for it although the rooms are on the smaller side think europe if youve ever been but they were clean and nicely decorated
the location of the hotel couldnt be better its right on union square with plenty of restaurants bars and shops within walking distance there is also a cable car stop right out front that goes directly to fishermans warf
we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel",4.0
great location,great location for all the activities in olde town we got a super deal on priceline and got a room on the priority club floor  not sure of the difference but the room appeared to be recently renovated bathroom was small but just fine for an average person the roof top pool was small but good enough for the kids to have some play time and there were plenty of towels restaurant was good for breakfast especially with kids eat free coupons but there are numerous dining options within easy walking distance of the hotel front desk was friendly but did not go out of their way to do anything extra for guests check out the independence visitor information desk for all the great deals  we got an amex 2 for 1on lights of liberty which the whole family enjoyed and a 2 for 1 lunch at the city tavern we stayed 3 days could have probably used one more for all the historical things to do overall hotel is just above average,4.0
good tourist choice,good location and walkable to most tourist sites rooms were fine  nothing special staff were good reasonable rates in washington make it worth a recommendation good breakfasts across the road and 2 blocks south,4.0
great resort if youre white,"we recently stayed at the legacy golf resort for a week it was going well until we started using their fitness facility i was basicallly booted out of the fitness center because i was not white i felt like a black man in a kkk meeting
i thought racism has died down since the 70s apparently i am dead wrong racism and prejudice is still very much alive in this country and in particular arizona
i wouldnt recommend staying at this resort unless you are white",2.0
good place for the price,the rooms are small but clean need towel bars and or hooks location is great subway is 3 min away and plenty of stores and restaurants to meet your needs we stayed for 4 days and will stay again on our next trip to the city very safe neighborhood even late at night this is a good deal for the price if your going to lay your head down and sleep at the end of the day,3.0
compared to other reviews i was disappointed,we stayed at the 6th avenue inn and based on the other reviews i was expecting a bit more the price was right for downtown seattle although ive seen several people say you can use one of the discount hotel finding sites and get a comparable rate for a nicer place our room was clean enough although our windows needed a thorough cleaningreplacement and on one it looked like someone had spit on it the bathroom was small and we thought it was cleaner than the room actually beds were comfy enough we didnt experience much road noise there was one group that came back around 1am or 2am that was noisy but not much you can do about that overall it felt like an old property in need of some tlc felt old to me not quaint i thought there was a bit of an odd odor to the entire place but my wife and daughter seemed okay with everything the location worked out great for us within walking distance of the theatre shopping and the seattle aquarium all things we did there was a starbucks a couple of blocks away that we hit for breakfast we were able to keep our car parked there all day the next day while we explored seattle with no problems the staff was helpful and provided us a map right away a lot of people were at the breakfast at the restaurant a small exercise room my son and i used a bit outdated the plus sides  you save money theres parking available close to lots of activities the minuses outweigh the pluses for me next time i visit seattle ill try somewhere else this was a one time experience for me i must have missed what a lot of others seem to enjoy about this place,3.0

quality hotel in the heart of boston,"this was our second hotel on our recent fly drive to new york city and new england
we only stayed here 2 nights but this was a stunning hotel
the service and friendliness of the staff was first class we had problem with the aircon in the room after contacting reception an engineer was sent up to our room within 5 minutes who sorted out the problem straight away the hotel bar was very popular and therefore always busy but we found a table for a drink on one occasion
the breakfasts in the hotel although pricey were delicous and with the usual friendly staff
 boston is a great city to get around on foot the freedom trail is so easy to follow  just follow the red line on the pavement the hotel is well located so even though we only had 1 full day it was possible to get a good look around most things quincys market is not to be missed with every type of food available
we loved boston and would love to go back for another look",5.0
would never stay there again,after calling days before our arrival to verify that we would indeed have a room with two twin beds we were told upon arrival that all they had was a room with one king bed but after some delay they said that they would send up a rollaway bed the rollaway was so saggy in the middle that sleep was next to impossible and the king bed was not much better the room temperature was extremely cold but we were told that the thermostat was central to the entire hotel and they could not adjust it for one room that was the first night it was late so we went to bed the next morning after complaining again about the temperature they reluctantly said that they could possible bring a portable heater to the room this should have been suggested on the first night the 24 hour coffee was nonexistent since the machine was broken we never saw the sunny reading room that was advertised on our last day we went to the complimentary breakfast to find one bagel left no milk for the coffee and no one around to help us i would never stay here again and would be reluctant to stay at any of their sister properties,1.0
the worst hilton i have ever stayed in,im writing this as im in this muggy damp stinky room as soon as i opened the door i could smell mildew and humidity its a shame for a hotel under the hilton name i was waiting for my daughter to arrive from her trip and didnt want to make a fuss but when i tried to log in for wifi they had the audacity to charge 999 as if they were some type of luxury hotel i will never ever recommend this hotel to top it all we had to call for someone to stop the toilet from making gurgling sounds disgusting,2.0
great place to stay,this hotel is a great place to stay it close to the riverwalk the alamodome the alamo the rooms are very spacious and furnished with oak furniture the beds comfortable the free breakfast was good and the staff is great we tried to book on line and were unable it said the hotel was full but with one quick phone call to the hotel and a room change they were able to give us a room we were unwaware of springbreak the free parking and free wifi were an added bonus thanks for making our stay a great one,5.0
good option,i had a short stay here recently on business i would recommend the rooms was a good size and decently appointed considering the price i slept well the staff at checkin were friendly and professional breakfast was very good with a nice omelette and fresh orange juice,4.0
worst customer service on the planet,"first let me say that the staff is unprofessional at best the security guy wore an old dirty tshirt and layed around in the lobby watching tv during my entire 4 night stay houskeeping came to clean my room and somehow took the remote with them when i asked for a replacement remote after working 14 hours and wanting nothing more than to lay in bed and be lazy i was told that there were no extra ones and i could use the buttons on the tv to change the volume and channel i asked the young lady at the desk to simply move me to another room with a remote since they refused my suggestion of taking a remote from an unbooked room she advised me to come down and get a new key she assigned a new room but just as i was about to move to the new room the security guy came and in front of me reprimanded her for moving me to a room they may be able to sell simply because i dont have a remote he then grabbed an old bag of beat up remotes and tried to get them to work once he realized they werent working he reluctantly gave me the one from his roomwhere i believe he lives 
to make matters worse i was charged twice for the stay and have had nothing but issues with trying to get the money back from them two weeks have passed and the manager phyllis ward has avoided me like the plague i even have my booking agent calling to resolve this and she is avoiding them too they even refused to send me a receipt showing the additional charge they made to my account 
i will never stay at that hotel again and i will never recommend it to anyone the room was nice but the exterior was frightening the staff was unprofessional and they wouldnt even give me a toothbrush after i inadvertently left mine at home",1.0
lap of luxury in dc,this was one of the best hotel experiences i have ever had the hotel was beautifully decorated for christmas the room had every amenity we needed including slippers and the staff were super friendly the location just a block away from the white house could not have been more convenient for getting around on foot i loved the 24 hour coffeetea service and the great fitness room we had a delicious breakfast in the dining room which was so filling that we didnt need any lunch later in the day breakfast started with a shot glass of a berry smoothie and a basket of warm bread which included chocolate croissants we felt very pampered from the moment we arrived,5.0
excellent stop near the airport,we stayed one night at the hotel after a late arrival from the east coast hotel is not new but well maintained and staff welcoming and professional there is now a regular hotel shuttle from the airport that replaces the taxi service mentioned by some the room was clean and comfortable and the hotel quiet breakfast was very good for an included hotel breakfast walking distance to a convenience store and 24 hr restaurant would certainly stay again under the same circumstances,4.0
average hotel great location great price,an older well kept property with a good buffet breakfast that includes home made waffles and sausage the hotel doesnt have an elevator so if you are on the second floor you wil have to lug your suticase and stuff up a flight of stairs each room has a nice balcony that faces inward towards the swimmng pool the staff is wonderful and very very helpful on the negative side my wife found two dead cockroaches in the drawers and the acheater had an interesting constant whine otherwise the property was clean and well maintained with the exception of the cockroaches and acheater the most positive things were the wonderful staff and the pricei am sure that many travellers may want look at this property,3.0
scary,my friend and i booked the hotel online through citlybase when we got there we were scared the place was being renovated and there were sand bags in the front entrance we booked a double bed but the man at the desk kindly told us we could have 2 twins which we accepted the room was awful there were hairs in the bed and our bathroom had no toilet paper and no towels you wouldnt want to step foot in there with fear that you would get a fungal infection and im not exaggerating we were nervous about asking for reimbursement there was no way we were staying there we told the guy at the front desk that our room was unsatisfactory he got the maid to clean it and to change the sheets we still hadnt planned on staying we phoned citybase from the payphone and they told me it was okay not to stay there and refunded my money hopefully by the end of the month my visa will be reimbursed we went down the street to the howard johnson and got a king size bed and a nice bathroom for 10 more a night my advice is definitly stick with the chains the picture they show of the room online of the new york inn is deceiving two young women definitly did not feel safe there,1.0
lovely service excellent location comfortable rooms,i stayed here for one night with my fiance and a friend on a week long road trip around the east coast by far the most relaxing place i stayed hotel staff was friendly pleasant and attentive we also had a dog on the trip the staff was extremely warm with our dog as well anyone with pets realizes that dogs are not always welcome at hotels the location was beautiful a block from the harbor this is one of the best locations there is also a 24 hour subway restaurant next door that was convenient when the rest of baltimore is closed down the evening reception in the cloud lounge was wonderful as was breakfast all in all i wouldnt really think of staying anywhere else in baltimore excellent stay the only reason service got a 4 instead of 5 was because the valet parking was slightly backed up when we arrived and the traffic from the street was difficult to deal with when we were not even pulled into the garage yet only took 510 minutes and we were set up,5.0
pretty good ,"our visit here with 2 small children started off being dumped on the curb by the cab with a vomiting child nowhere near the main entrance  bad start but not the hotels fault cab driver claimed he could not find main entrance however told my parents the same thing when they arrived  
the front desk service was exceptional we were offered a free bar fridge as we had little ones and were very sympathetic with our sick little girl although it was early in the morning they changed our room to one that was availble there and then we were very impressed small but clean rooms with pretty impressive viewswe also found a laundry however it was at least half hours walk but it came in handy 
nfortunately the good service stopped at the front desk while the bell man was awesome the doorman service to get a cab was disgustuing and we were not happy we were ignored told to go out on the street to get a cab and then sent back to doorman who again ignored our request there were taxis lined up he just needed to blow his whistle the lovely bellman finally called one for us however we were late for our tour
the hotel is in times square literally and has a real buzz to it a couple of nights would have been enough though as we should have stayed more central to other attractions within walking distance dont get me wrong plenty around in times square but 2 days would have been enough for us it is a major toursit attraction and tourists are all you will see  
this is the main reason why we would stay elseware on our next visit to new york ie in the west village or similar much easier to get cabs wasnt touristy and locals were much friendlier new york is not and easy place to get around if you are relying on cabs which we did because of the kids in my opinion it was the worst place we could have stayed for us
it is a real touristy area and they just dont like tourists as a result we dropped our heads and didnt see half of what we wanted to  
overall pretty good place to stay for a couple of nights to see times square and surrounds but wouldnt base myself there ",3.0
what a way to begin our trip to texas,we loved it it set the tone for our first trip to texas with its fabulous lobby and bar the terrific terrace cafe had lunch  excellent food and service and breakfast  horrible service but good food rooms with ultrahigh ceilings marble bathrooms sumptuous bed unique appointments in the hallwaysit was so big a great start to our trip it says its on brazos stand was right on the corner of 6th  which right in the heart of all the 6th street action as busy as 6th waswe did not hear anything at all in our room as we had a very peaceful nights sleep it is also very centrally located for any sightseeing you might want  north to the bob bullack museum and the capitol and south to the bridge to see the batsa sight to be seen,4.0
clean comfortable room with very friendly and helpful staff,we arrived to a very friendly and helpful staff everyone that we dealt with the entire weekend had smiles on their faces and were very eager to help the room was clean and tidy it was an average sized room for nyc  not tiny but not huge however it had two queen sized beds which were extremely comfortable and afforded a wonderful nights sleep the bathroom was also clean and appointed as i would expect for this level of a hotel all in all it was a very enjoyable and easy stay i would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay near midtown but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle being located in the flower district it was really neat to see all the flower vendors on the street and added a little something extra to the experience this location was also convenient to chelsea and the restaurants and nightlife nearby,4.0
exquisite boutique hotel in midtown east,"i got the benjamin for a sunday and monday night through a successful bid on priceline and could not have been more delighted it is a beautiful old boutique hotel in midtown east with an absolutely charming lobby
when i checked in i asked for a room with two beds because a girlfriend was going to be joining me on the second night i was informed that the hotel did not have rooms with two beds but the receptionist very kindly upgraded me for free to a luxury studio with a king size bed this was a such a decent thing to do given that i was already staying on a great rate
the room was on the corner of the building and very spacious by new york standards what made it so much better than your average hotel room is that it had a fully equipped kitchenette with full sized fridgefreezer and microwave i do appreciate a room with a fridge for your own champagne and breakfast items rather than having to jam them in to a tiny automated minibar
the marble bathroom had a window so was light and airy and boasted elemis products a lighted shaving mirror and another mirror in the tub itself this was a bathroom where it was a real pleasure to soak in the tub before heading out for the evening
i like the midtown east area it is far less touristy than the theater district but has lots of hustle and bustle and great little diners and bars its still only about a fifteen minute walk to times square
my only gripe with the benjamin is the same one i have with most high end hotels  it nickel and dimes you on the little things 7 bucks for a small bottle of water and no free internet it costs nothing for hotels to provide free wifi these days and all the lower end ones do i am not going to complain too much as i got this at such a good price but if i was paying the full rate i would be so irritated these days i and a lot of other people when paying full price will go for a nice modern 3 with free wifi rather than a midrange 4 that charges for it
i just want to add that the receptionist maids concierge bellman and doorman were fantastic and i do highly recommend the place",4.0
very nice staff,we have just returned from a week at the wellington our room was very small carpet and furniture had seen better days first night there i found a bug in my bed was about 2 ins long husband complained we were moved 2 another room it was beautiful huge with a kitchen bathroom and balcony with lovely views of the city we had a wonderful time the staff are very friendly,5.0
great if you are frank sin,"travelled with two friends so we decided to take a so called suite that turned out to be a bed room with an adjoining living room that had a sofa bed in it i was the unlucky one to sleep on the uncomfortable sofa bed the windows were very thin and the curtains were even thinner so i heard and saw the sights and sounds of the noisiest island on earth every night great if you are frank sinatra looking for inspiration to write a new song
breakfast was the typical industrial bland version of egg powderturnomlette and sicklysweetorange juice the breakfast staff casually threw cuttlery and plates around making so much noise it would have been impossible to eat had the food been edible  luckily it wasnt so problem solved",2.0
a really great experience,"theres a lot of positive things about this place
 first is location  its extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well there is also a trader joes and vons within less than a half mile  almost walking distance the location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful with bayfrontestuary views and a huge walkingbiking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off because of the proximity to the airport 
 the rooms have a nice almost full kitchen  full size fridge dishwasher microwave 2 burner range and no oven there is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with 2 chairs in our one bedroom unit theres a nice little balcony with one chair on it  for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine there are two lg flatscreen tvs  one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate the fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression but it was still comfortable theres a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable the bed linens are soft and comfortable there are a wide variety of pillows available the toilet paper is cottonelle  so its nice and soft not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now and the toiletries are very nice neutrogena products 
 the business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes the laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job my husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill elliptical stationary bike free weights and a weight machine  drinking fountains and a tv were available in the workout room 
the gardens and outdoor areas were extensive well landscaped and maintained there was quite a variety of outdoor seating available with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas there were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern clean and ready to go 
the breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate  but not gourmet you get hot filling food but its just kind of average standard make your own waffles bagels english muffins etc  three hot offerings which usually are eggs sausage and tater tots  the best of which is the tater tots and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches canned mandarins cottage cheese and yogurt and some fresh melon chunks evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar and a hot offering that has been during our stay  edible but mostly because its included theres drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day 
i found the staff to be friendly and responsive even when our flight was delayed the cleaning staff is polite unobtrusive and efficient
the hotel offers very good rates with nice discounts for government and aaa and they participate in the hh points program it is a family oriented hotel so there will be kids at breakfast in the pool etc and of course their behavior is up to their parents  but we had no problem with noise 
overall  the best place to stay in sandiego if youre not looking for night life excitement etc if you want a great convenient location nice facilities large room kitchen facilities and the open air experience  with just a few minutes to the zoo seaworld balboa park airport and downtown  no parking fees no internet fees and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around this ones got it",5.0
classy hampton inn,"i recently spent 4 nights at this hotel on leisure travel with my husband at first glance i wasnt sure we were in the right place the building facade and lobby are pretty classy by hampton inn standards the rooms themselves are basic hampton inn style and are on the smaller side by comparison but definitely still comfortable and clean the loungebreakfasthappy hour location is really nice and access to the outside balcony is great one night we bought a bottle of wine and just sat on the balcony reading and watching the traffic
the location of the hotel is ideal we walked everywhere dinners tourist attractions leisure strolls etc and had no difficultly orienting ourselves and navigating the city there are plenty of places to eat and drink within a block of the hotel if you dont feel like going further but 6th street is a short stroll up the road we even walked to ut and the state capitol
morning breakfast was good but basic it was often crowded and staff was soso about refilling missing items definitely still good but not above average for a hampton inn we only took advantage of happy hour one night and staff was friendly and the food and drinks were great
my one complaint about this hotel is the parking the price 23 while we were there is steep but i understand thats the norm in most cities however not having an option for self park is very annoying having to depend on and tip a valet when im perfectly capable of walking into the garage and getting my car is just bothersome the valet service was backed up and slow every time we needed the car one evening we waited 15 minutes for our car im not complaining too much about the price but am complaining about the valet service one tip if you stay on a weekend just park on the street nearby for free and better convenience we did this the one weekend night we were in town",4.0

the best,just returned from nyc  3 ladies and 2 teenagers on a girls weekend away affinia was just as reported on tripadvisor beds very comfortable 2 bathrooms with great toiletries nice to have a kitchen for quick snacks maureen at the concierge desk was exceptionally helpful our only complaint was that we could not turn off the heating if you are looking for a quiet night in affinia manhattan is not the place for you but if you want to be part of downtown new york do not hesitate to choose this hotel,5.0
quick hop to the metro,"this residence inn  part of the marriott line is great for extended stays and families the room was a large suite with a living area kitchen and dining area the bed is not in a separate room but set off to the side the sofa is a sleeper though the kitchen included all the utensils but you dont need them much since this one offers a full breakfast buffet and evening snacks during the weekdays 
the best part of this hotel is that it is right around the corner from the federal metro stop hop on that and you are at the mall in ten mintues and luckily on the way is a starbucks however no eating or drinking on the metro it is possibly the best public transportation system i have used
the only drawback to this hotel  the bed every one is hard and uncomfortable but i was so exhausted after 8 hours of walking the musuems that i hardly noticed
the location is good for metro and such but there arent any restaurants nearby so do your eating in town there is a grocery store about a mile away",4.0
great location nice rooms but,couldnt ask for a better location rooms are nice and clean etc had there not been people picketing and shouting outside i believe they were employees it would have been great they blocked the front so we had to walk around and it was very intimidating to my daughter im not sure what exactly it was over and im not taking sides but i work hard and dont get much time off and it certainly punished me more than whomever the picketers sp were trying to punish,4.0
anniversary getaway,we were absolutely delighted to find out that we could redeem our wyndham rewards points for a free night in nyc it was so cool that the hotel was so centrally located in the middle of town we had a fantastic time in the city  the room was so nice the bed incredibly comfortable and the outside patio was especially pleasant for breakfast service was great,5.0
first time at the sheraton gunter in san antonio,the sheraton gunter was everything i expect from a hotel in san antonio  historic beautiful comfortable and so conveniently located i really loved the historic feel to the hotel fitness center was great the bed was very comfortable i walked to my convention daily and my husband was able to walk to the river walk and also to market square we have never stayed in this area but we found it was the best location for all we wanted well go back thanks,5.0
great stay,i stayed here for business and unfortunately had to ship a number of boxes to my hotel room the concierge bell hop and shipping department were wonderful and made the whole process of dealing with heavy boxes manageable the westin charlotte definitely has the best concierge ive ever dealt with he gave great restaurant recommendations and was patient even with the strangest requests i very rarely compliment anyone for doing a good job but i made sure to tell the front desk manager that the concierge was amazing the room was nice and clean and what ive come to expect from a westin property and i would definitely stay here again because of my pleasant experience with the staff especially the concierge,5.0
dorothy parker would expect no less,"okay if youre going to be near times square which is good because of your proximity to both sides of town and both train stations why not be in one of the most famous hotels in the world its worth it and you wont find many rooms like this in nyc the beds are extremely warm and cozy the art on the walls all tell tales of the history of the hotel from illustrations depicting the originators of the atlantic monthly to handwritten poetry of dorothy parker to letters to his editor by truman capote the bathrooms are deep the water warm it really has everything you need including vintage old nyc furniture that is comfortable and in unbelievably good condition and to think you are only a few floors above the round table to be so close to a round surface with simple wooden legs that at one time hosted the liveliest most important and humorous ongoing literary dialogues in the world if you have a large enough group you can actually reserve that table positively remarkable considering this piece of furniture should be stored in the smithsonian 
one drawback some of the help there are the nice men and women who are the waiters and the maids we decided some of the waiters were straight out of new yorker cartoons and you cant help but get the feeling most of the help has been there since 1934 and still get a kick out of each other and their job theyre not the problem 
its some of the unpleasant andor inefficient characters at the front desk though one or two were friendly and helpful most were snobby and seemed put upon  as though they had better things to do and while the day concierge was sweet as all get out he did not as promised provide me with a special store he and i had a lengthy conversation about 
a slightly less inocuous example of poor behavior occured when i explained to the current front desk man that the man from the previous evening promised me a great rate for the following night which he truly had the man at the front desk smirked barely looked me in the eye and said he didnt know why that happened that gentleman shouldnt have promised me that and he couldnt help me then he went about his business as i stood there at the moment if i hadnt liked others in the hotel as much and the room i would have asked he move my stuff out and i get my money back his manner was postively rude and discourteous perhaps he was correct his colleague should have made no such promises and perhaps i should have taken up his colleagues offer when he put it out there but this charming man could have handled it without being so disgustingly unpleasant 
i was further underwhelmed when i discovered i had lost a piece of jewelry once having discovered the loss on my way to another location i phoned the front desk to explain what i had missing but after that call no one got back to me and it was a family heirloom i phoned the hotel to find out about the follow up and had many short conversations that seemed perfunctory with the front desk pleading they check again with security but neither they nor their security officer has bothered to phone me to this day honestly even if it were to simply say miss weve interviewed everyone theres nothing we can do we are so sorry i would have been disappointed but felt the proper attention had been paid instead i am left angry and disenchanted 
granted i was there during the holidays and no one wants to work during that time but as long as theyre there and im there and we are all there together i think they could have bent over backwards or sideways or bent their bodies upwards to look me in the eyes so as to make my stay more pleasant and prevent such a complex review 
these to me though are luxurious problems its not like i would call downstairs ask for tea and it wouldnt arrive within ten minutes although everything cost a buttload  watch out for the costs one one minute phone call to la cost me ten dollars there were many moments of excellent hospitality and regardless of my specific disparaging remarks the algonquin is a charming beautiful comfortable hotel in a good location just bring a little attitude in your bag so when necessary you can throw it back to mr charming pants at the front desk dorothy parker would expect no less 
ps if you make ressies on line be careful you are not quoted one rate for one evening and another rate for another evening i got stung that way and insisted prior to checking in it be changed at once they did so which was helpful but keep your eye on the ball im positive this is common practice amongst many hotels but its an odd practice and the ethics of which i question",4.0

our stay at houston four points,our stay was made so hospitable by jessica selcotoshe deserves a 5 star ratingthe location of the motel is easy to get to from the airport the down side is it is located near a major interstate the motel over all was a good choice but the major plus is the staff,4.0
great location so so rooms,"i used this site to pick the king george and got a low cost rate i have a feeling their rack rates are high and then they discount heavily to give the impression you are getting a bargain the location cant be faulted it is central to everything and within say 200 metres to the cable cars union square and major shops on powell st 
the staff were efficient and friendly the rooms are tiny just the bed and a chair or two and a writing table separate bathroom and full bath no air conditioning just a fan it was very hot the 3 days i was there in september because the wall faced the afternoon sun thank goodness i could open the window to cool it down no mini bar but an in room safe usual tv video games etc the solitary lift in this old building is renovated but can take a while in peak periods using the stairs is ok but hang on they are steep and only fit one person heart attack material by the eighth floor i prefer the cartwright hotel for a similar old world renovated style but it is higher up on sutter st near the crowne plaza and westin overall the king george is in a great location with so so small rooms they are clean and tidy fine for a quick stopover or business trip but nothing to write home about",3.0
expensive without continental breakfast,"on the site there is written they have continental breakfast but they give you a coupon to use in a little caffè where you have a little choice or if you want you can go to take a burger at 900 am on the other side of the street

no good restaurants nearby and unfortunately a lot of homeless in the evening",1.0
do not stay at this hotel,"date march 29 2007
reviewer trip advisor member oregon
this hotel was the worst hotel with the worst staff that we have ever
stayed at we reserved a non smoking room when arrived at 430p we were given a smoking room the smoke smell was so strong i couldnt stay 5 minutes in the room we went back to the desk to get another room they gave us a key to another room it was a smoking room and the room hadnt been cleaned we went back to the desk and they said there wasnt any non smoking rooms and they would get someone to clean the room the smoke smell wasnt too bad so we agreed we went to dinner and when we returned we went into the bathroom and the back
of the bathroom door had a hole punched in it at 930p we had a knock at our door it was the hotel staff asking us what we were doing in the room they said it was not to be occupied we explained and they said ok anout 1030 pm i noticed there was no smoke detector only wires hanging from the wall the next morning i went to take a shower i could get water to come out of the faucet but couldnt get the water to come out of the shower head my husband came in and after about 10 minutes he was able to force the handel open so i could take a shower when i went to use the hairdryer there
were 3 holes in the wall where the hairdryer used to be we went to breakfast about 800 am there was syrup but nothing to put the syrup on there were no pastries or muffins there was cereal and few
peices of bread to toast and a couple of hard boiled eggs there was no one around to ask to replenish the breakfast buffet when we checked out we told the clerk about all our problems she said ok no apology no concern another girl behind the desk said you should write the problems in the book so they can be fixed this hotel was not a cheap hotel we paid over 100 for the night
i did contact la quinta headquarters when we returned home to tell them about our terrible experience they had the manager of the hotel
call us she apologized and said she would check the rooms we were in and get them fixed she also adjusted the charges she said the policy of la quinta doesnt guarantee you will get the type room you requested i said i can understand if you cant give me the type of bed or the lower flower i requested but does that mean if i request
non smoking i cant be quaranteed a non smoking room she said yes that is their policy i am allergic to smoke and if that is la quinta
policy i will never stay at another one of their hotels 
i appreciated the call from the manager but she needs to train her staff and be more aware of what is going on in her hotel i would never stay at this hotel again",1.0
heaven on a pier,we have just returned from our second vacation at the crystal pier and all i can say is the place is wonderful the staff is polite and will will help you with anything you need the views and the sunsets are outstanding i would tell everyone that you must stay at the pier at least one time in your life to really grasp the meaning of heaven on a pier,5.0
good place in nyc,rooms were little but not sound proof could here tv music etc from room next door staff were helpful and friendly except for one waiter at the outside bar who seemed he just didnt care about serving drinks good location  walkable to time square theatres and subway would recommend this place more for a group of friends travelling rather than a solo person as the outdoor terrace is good place to relax with a few glasses of wine,3.0
i enjoyed the stay,melissa kim and craig were great they showed alot of professionalism and friendly customer courtesy,5.0
great location but basic,"i have had this booked months however on arrival they had no record of my party i nearly died i had all my booking forms from travel agent so after speaking to manager matt they gave me a room after paying again for 1 night until they could clear this mess up with thomas cook not a great start room was basic but clean 2 double beds for our party of 3 room was on 3rd floor right next to lifthotel was packed full of school trips so can you picture the noise on a nighthowever we were that tired with walking it was no problem falling alseep
san francisco was greatweather around 50 degrees every day 1 day it rained bad however i thought we hit lucky with the weather hotel is right in fishermans wharf so great to look around however we liked to walk and went to union square a lot too
we had prebooked a few tours and we had to meet them outside ferry building i do advise a tour of city on first full day it gives you a great idea of location and shows you everything with a bit of history too
overall holiday was greatfood too good would i stay and this hotel again yes its all you needclean and no hassle",4.0
diamond in the rough,3 blks from times square great location nice and clean and generous size rooms wonderful pool and workout room as well room service unbelievably inexpensive and delicious will definitely return there is no other place like this one,5.0
great location  room  service,"stayed 3 nights june 1215 2008 in a king room on the 1st floor there was no view just a courtyard of windows  but that didnt matter because we were sightseeing from morning til night and i was too tired to care when we were finished 
if you need a nice hotel in a greatsafe location with a clean room  free breakfast  look no further we got a rate of 187 per night through the hotels website  and when you factor in the complimentary breakfast  thats a pretty good deal there is plenty to eat  not just danish  coffee they had hot cinnamon rolls cold cereal carton milk eggs scrambled or omelet depending on the day bacon or sausage depending on the day biscuits and gravy daily and then breads english muffins and bagels if this doesnt work for you there is a dennys literally right around the corner  as well as a walgreen in case you need popwater medicine sunscreen snacks toothpaste film developing socks  or anything else you forgot or think you might need 
the turnaround for the powellmason is only 2 blocks from the hotel you can pay 5 per way per person or buy a 3day unlimited ride pass for 18 per person we chose this option which gave us no excuse to explore the city more
overall a great hotel  no complaints the rooms were big  clean had inroom safe iron ironing board coffee internet movies video games etc there are 2 computers for internet access just off the lobby that are available 247 at no cost great for printing boarding passes for the flight home booking tours researching restaurants and attractions  and checking your emails from home  as well as sending the standard wish you were here email to the folks back home",5.0
lovely hotel great location,very big hotel staff are friendly the rooms are big and the beds are the comfiest beds i have come across you get a fridge and iron in the room the gym is big and well equipped and the pool area is really nice the hotel sports bar serves good food and reasonably priced drinks and has a good atmosphere the hotel is connected to the mall do easy to get to the shops and restaurants great location with loads of restaurants and shops nearby starbucks within the hotel is a bonus wifi available also,5.0
great value and location,"pleasantly surprised at the value this centrally located hotel offers new york hotel prices can be extreme but the red roof was excellent 
room looks small at first but you dont spend much time there anyway interesting view of the empire state building entrance to 34th street subway at the end of the block was a bonus walkable distance from times square a bit of noise from the street throughout the night and in the morning but it is new york  and still managed a good night sleep comfortable beds
clean but slightly dated bathrooms
excellent conciergebellboys  very friendly
will stay here again on my next trip to new york",4.0
well worth a stay,stayed at the gansevoort over xmas 2011 great location and ideal fo rmany sights to visit including the hi line,5.0
ideal location for steakhouses and shopping,we arrived late evening and was immediately welcomed by the bellman upon arriving at the sixth floor lobby we were again genuinely welcomed by the manager who moved us from the 10th to the 18th floor for a better view we were within walking distance to several restaurants that would please any palate and wallet it was great to take our leftovers back to the hotel to warm in the full kitchen the free buffet breakfast was pleasing with a different menu each day staff was accomodating and friendly overall we were well pleased be prepared for the 42 valet parking with in and out priviledges,4.0
good for families,"the beacon hotel is a great boutique hotel that we found to be family friendly our stay entailed staying a friday and saturday and checking out sunday at noon my husband had some business he was conducting during friday  saturday very near to the hotel hence the reason we stayed at this location and not closer to the main attractions of dc additionally the bedbug registry was checked there were no reports associated with this hotel so we chose to stay at the beacon 
having bedbug phobia and upon arrival my husband  i took apart the beds to check for bedbugs we saw no signs anywhere around the mattresses or headboards relief the mattresses all seemed new and had those bedbug covers on them i checked the drawers and all around the place and it looked ok so we stayed one night my 5 yr son slept only in pj pants and no shirt and had no bites in the morning upon close inspection granted i nor my family have never had a bedbug encounter but ive just been reading so much about it i feel like i could accurately identify bites so it freaks me out badly 
so anyways we had reserved adjoining rooms one room had two double beds a sleeper couch and a kitchenette and the other was just their standard room with a king sized bed the exact term would be corporate quarters double double room which had the kitchenette and our room was a king deluxe room the double was definitely large and was where our boys 5 yrs 3 yrs and 9 months slept my neighbors sister babysat our children at night as we had plans with friends for dinner during the evenings so it was necessary to make sure there was ample room for 3 energetic boys the kitchenette sink microwave etc sure came in handy we had bought snacks such as microwavable popcorn and frozen pizzas for them while they watched a tv show with the sitter the bathroom was very large and there was lots of closet space overall the room was clean i had requested a crib for our baby and a pacnplay was brought to us quickly up room arrival i would suggest requesting a high chair from the restaurant as there are none in the room one was brought for us to use during our stay 
the king room that adjoined the double room was very small which was fine for us to sleep in keep our clothes in and have some privacy we were very grateful that we purchased the double and not another king for our boys it was probably not the biggest room ive stayed in but it was ok for us if you are looking for luxury and plan to spend much time in your room id suggest upgrading to a larger room 
overall we were very pleased with the service and our stay it was quiet and we barely heard other patrons or street noise so that was lovely we did not eat in the hotel so i can not rate the food however we had heard through friends that the brunch is very good 
lastly upon writing this a week after our stay we are 100 sure that we had no bedbug encounters and have not brought any home although we did take all the necessary precautions to not bring them into our home i would recommend staying here",4.0
beautiful view friendly helpful service good value will stay again,we found the hotel to be very nice the view of grant park and the lake was beautiful the room was clean the staff was nice and helpful room service messed up our breakfast order but fixed it in minutes,4.0
at last a place that i can call home in new york,"great hotel whos rooms are huge by normal new york standards i booked this hotel on the basis of previous reviews and also because we have stayed in quite a few hampton inns and have always had a good experience this hotel did nothing to spoil that opinion 
the desk staff were excellent especially lisa the rooms were always cleaned well and promptly by happy friendly staff the rooms thmselves were well appointed and as previously mentioned huge by new york standards the bed was wonderfully comfortable which is important after hours of pounding the pavement sightseeing and shopping hmmmmmmmmmm shopping one of my favorite things to do especially in new york as other reviewers have mentioned the location of the hotel is fabulous for all the major shopsdont forget when you go to maceys to take your passport with you and go to the customer service desk and get a discount shoppers card it will give you 10 off the majority of your purchases even things that are on sale are included manhattan is great for clothing and shoes because there is no sales tax on an item if it is under 110 so what you see on the tag is what you pay unlike other american states
in a nutshell i wont be staying anywhere else next time we are in new york i have travelled there many times and have finally found a place that ticks all the boxes clean well located well appointed reasonably priced no mean feat in nyc free internet and free breakfast with friendly staff to wrap up the parcel",5.0
great value for a family weekend in dc,we stayed two nights over labor day weekend   overall it is a very nice family hotel in a good location near 14th street clean welllit  travelled easy to get in and out it is a treck to the metro station about 3 long blocks so if your children are younger than 67 i would probably choose something with a closer stop otherwise we parked our car  forgot it for 2 days   public transport was very efficient and the hotel is close enough to the white house to walk there a cab to georgetown for dinner was less than 10 the breakfast was plentiful both hot  cold items  delicious  much appreciated by the mother of 3 hungry kids the staff was very pleasant  the children loved our maids creative handiwork with their stuffed animalsbedspreads the beds were comfortable pillows  linens were good quality after walkingsightseeing all day it was nice to come home to a large suite that was big enough for 3 adults  3 children the lobby area was very nice also i dont think it needs updating as some other reviewers noted we enjoyed our stay  would recommend to both families or business travellers my only complaint would be the cost of valet parking but i did see a public parking garage across the street that might be less expensive,5.0
lovely hotel but def paying over the top for the name,stayed here for a long weekend the hotel itself is lovely and well situated for shopping  site seeing  eating  drinking but well overpriced cost 200 a night and there are hotels a lot cheaper and with far better rooms the room didnt have anything wrong it was just nothing special for the price and our view was onto a nearby sky scraper the food was also very expensive though delicious new york is amazing though if i went back it would be a cheaper hotel,3.0
avoid this place at all costs,my husband and i traveled to the west coast for a family reunion we decided to make a vacation out of it and spent 4 days in gorgeous san francisco but our trip didnt start off that great we had reserved that hotel because of the indoor pool we found out it was being serviced and we would not be able to use it or the jacuzzi during our stay the clerk didnt even apologize and why didnt i get an email letting me know ahead of time that the hotel would be partially under construction then we were mortified that when we arrived at the hotel at midnight there was a half empty bottle of water on the floor next to the bed which made me think no one changed the sheets and dried pee on the toilet seat which made me think nothing in the room was clean i called down to the desk to let them know the room wasnt clean and all the desk clerk kept saying way ill make sure housekeeping doesnt charge you for the water after he finally understood and after a long flight and it was actually 3am for us we followed the bellman around the hotel looking for a clean room we had reserved a room with 1 king bed they then put us in a room with 2 beds my husband and i dont fit in a double bed but they said that was all they had that was clean but when i checked in and asked if the hotel was busy they said they barely had 30 of the hotel occupied anyways after 1 hour they finally found us a room that was correct and appeared clean they didnt have a room key so they said they would slide it under the door the next morning we left the room but forgot something we tried the room key they slid under the door and it didnt work i asked a housekeeper to let us in but she wouldnt that was understandable she pointed to the phone outside the elevator so i used it to call the desk they said they would send someone up twenty minutes later we finally got into the room there was no apology or anything in fact they tried to blame us by saying we must have demagnetized it the customer service was awful we decided to check out and find another hotel our initial reservation was for 4 nights and even though we checked out after 1 night the clerk didnt even ask us why i would assume in this economy they could use every red cent they could get,1.0
nice place to stay in cedar park texas,a group of us stayed here in september 2012 for a friends wedding that was just a few miles down the road the place was very nice clean and very comfortable as hampton inns typically are it was a good location with restaurants and shopping close by and was convenenient to the highways we needed to access,5.0
absolutely loved it,what a great find the rooms were huge and very comfortable the location was extremely convenient to everything we wanted to see and the service was impeccable and very friendly i highly recommend it for anyone wanting a comfortable affordable hotel with genuinely friendly helpful staff,5.0
poor staff and overpriced,"just got back from a 3000 person conference at hilton bayfront and i was very disappointed with the hotel the staff had no idea what was going on all weekend had a coworker locked out of her room because of a mistake the hotel made very overpriced i would not recommend this hotel for personal or business travel 
rooms were clean",1.0
worries laid to rest,was worried about the stay after reading other reviews but after arriving i was very pleased the checkin process went very smoothly and the room itself was clean and comfortable the bed was down right luxurious and the bathroom was impeccable my only complaint would be that the walls to the rooms are paper thin several times normal conversation and moderate tv noise could be clearly heard would i book again yes,4.0
the closest to universal studios,our family recently returned from an overnight trip to universal studios for halloween horror nights and we loved our stay at the hilton the walk tofrom universal was really easy even at 2 am the hotel was safe and clean and every single employee we came across was really nice and friendly and truly seemed to care that we were all happy and well taken care of in total we had three rooms but we all came in one vehicle and we were only charged for one vehicle no issues with billing check in and check out was a breeze much appreciated since my husband and i were traveling with all teenagers it was a flawlessly easy break with the kids thanks to the hilton also about an hour after we arrived they brought us all in all three rooms bottled waters compliments of the hotelvery nice touch the view from the hotel was amazing the beds and pillowsso comfy great trip you cant go wrong staying here,5.0
like other reviewers have stated dont stay in a room near the train,"unfortunately the hotel was booked solid when i checked in on a saturday night therefore all they could give me was a room near the train near the i think its northwest corner of the hotel the train is pretty dang loud i realize this is tough for the hotel because they cant help the fact that theyre near the train i suppose the only solution expensive solution is to install soundproof windows and we all know thats not going to happen
they couldnt switch my room that night but kindly did so the next night they were really nice about it and didnt seem at all surprised that i wanted to switch
the room the 2nd night was very quiet except for the woman next door who was practicing her singing at 1030pm after a few knocks on the wall she stopped and this is not the fault of the hotel anyway
the breakfast was good but i didnt have dinner there so i cant share my opinions about that the lobby is gorgeous and the staff was very nice and helpful both rooms were very spacious well appointed and clean
overall id say this is a great hotel if you have the right room location",4.0
donald trump has really outdone himself,everything at this luxurious was superb the staff was extremely friendly the rooms were emaculate and everything else was equally as amazing one problem this hotel still has a great location but not ideal some destinations we were headed to were a far walk or taxi from the hotel overall this was one if the best hotel stays ever,5.0
great service goes a long way,the customer service was incredible although the 1020 minute walk to areas of interest got a little tiresome the staff at this hotel was so kind considerate and helpful i was asked about my stay by different staff members in different departments at least 5 times a day the employees there created a home away from home feeling any and every request or concern was addressed immediately if someone even sensed that you may need some help an employee was right there with a smiling face we traveled with handicap elderly and small children and the staff was absolutely wonderful offering assistance and accommodating our needs this hotel is more animal friendly than any hotel ive visited but still clean a for great service,5.0
we loved this hotel,"i just have to say that this was probably the best hotel experience i and my family have had myself and my family were in town for a family function and we decided to stay at the palomar because of what other friends and said about the hotel
not on did they accomindate us by giving us 2 rooms right next to each other but the guest services people went above and beyond and came to our room to make sure we all were satisfied yes it was great to see a hotel that actually is really pet friendly
 the hotel was so beautiful at night when we saw a couple of times its something you raley notice but with this hotel it was so noticeable we had dinner in the resturant on saturday night and the food was amazing but the chef wasnt there on a saturday kinda weird right so im guessing the other chefs did it but it was great food try the peaches pizza
the rooms were nicely decorated and the pool is amazing i think the best part of the entire stay was to see the smile on my family members face when the lady at the concig came over and asked her by name how her stay is going this says a lot about a hotel and the service they give
just to let everyone know this was an amazing experience thank you hotel palomar",5.0
impressive hotel with friendly staff,"i have to say i was actually impressed with this property this is my first time at a staybridge suites hotel but i am not disappointed at all i would like to thank jane and all the staff at this hotel for all their concerted efforts to make the guests feel welcome 
check in it was a breeze and they even had a parcel for me that i had preordered online from an online shoe company
staff everyone was friendly
rooms we were allocated rooms on the 26th floor room size was perfect as i have seen smaller rooms in the city i had a really good sleep on the beds
gym  breakfast this is my first trip anywhere that i did not check out the gym breakfast was goodscramblled eggstoastfruityoughurtoats as well albeit a little crowded but then there are so many options in the city
i have no complaints at all but i would caution people not to trust the negative reviews there are always going to be the whiners and complainers",5.0
a nice place to stay,"this hotel had a nice mix of old and new the furniture and building are definitely on the older side when i first walked into my room it gave me the feel of walking into my grandmothers house which for me is not a bad thing this is not to say the rooms have not been renovated in all the right ways the bed was perfect and very comfortable the bath was newly renovated and having the kitchen was much nicer than eating out every night 
the location was great  walking distance to the park and to hillcrest the hotel is gay owned and has a great happy hour on the roof deck on fridays but this is far from a gay hotel  it caters well to everyone my only problem was the lack of air conditioning in the rooms all of the windows opened wide and there was a ceiling fan but the temperature as unusually hot during my stay which made it tough to sleep at night im not certain that i would recommend staying here if the weather was expected to be hot but i doubt if this is a problem most of the time since from what im told it is usually much cooler in san diego than when i was there
the free parking and internet were a plus the view from the room was amazing and a great place to eat breakfast",4.0
style over substance,"the hudson hotel clearly places style over substance what i mean by that is that the atmosphere and cool decorating is obviously more important to the owners than meeting basic expectations most of us have of a hotel clean facilites and value for your money 
for example as others have stated the rooms are very small we had a studio  queen and while this may be one of the bigger rooms in the hotel it was still smaller than pretty much any other standard hotel room ive stayed in across this country also the shower curtain was stained and since the tub is so narrow it wants to envelope you as you take a shower nasty the rug looked barely vacuumed the deadbolt on the door usually didnt work the icemaker on our floor and the floor above us didnt work the icemaker on the floor below did work but many of the ice cubes had specks of dirt in them the ice tubs were all dirty the room was dusty a basic breakfast was 29 a bottle of beer was 9 one of our rooms wasnt ready for check in until after 430 i could go on and on
when you pay over 500 a night you should expect basic things such as the aformentioned to not be an issue but at the hudson they are we were part of a large group with several rooms and i saw the same issues in the other rooms as well honestly i find it insulting to pay so much and yet still have the issues we had
i know the hudson staff reads the reviews here from time to time since they do occasionally respond my question is how many times do people have to complain about the same things before you will actually do something about it talk is cheap 
yes the location was great and the staff was friendly but there are so many hotels in the area i cannot understand why anyone would return to this hotel we will not",2.0
excellent staff  comfortable small room,we spent last week at the doubletree by the houston airport our room was small but immaculately clean the bed was very comfortable i loved the down comforter  but im glad i brought my own pillow because the bed pillows were rock hard  the staff at the doubletree bent over backwards for us everyone who works there must love their job they were always so nice and accomodating i wasnt that happy with the restaurant  the hamburgers were good but the breakfast buffet was not very good i liked that they had a starbucks in the lobby we would definitely stay here again  the grounds were pretty the staff were great the rooms comfortable,5.0
resort in the city,tourists with daughter and our grandkids great pool excellent service wonderful breakfast buffet large rooms only a block to metro station but cab fares for the five of us were about the same as metro tickets lots of restaurants close to hotel a great place to unwind after a days sightseeing,5.0
good location  poor rooms,my husband and i stayed at this hotel for three nights while we were in boston while the location was good  in a cute neighborhood and close to the subway we were disappointed with the cleanliness and general upkeep in the apartment that we were in while the size of the apartment was sufficient the bathroom was dirty and the mattress was old and sagged in the middle the decor of room 109 was furnished in what looked like secondhand pieces of furniture that were badly banged up we were also disappointed with the staff we seemed to have a different person in the front office each day  while polite none were helpful with our questions,2.0
what a bad night ,"i did not notice that my room was overlooking the hotel loading dock until 400 am at that time a truck started to load unload stuff going forward and backward beeping loudly it stopped at 415 i felt asleep and it started again at 445 my night was over
given the fact that a hotel mission is to provide you with a comfortable sleeping night they failed and upon checkout the person on duty at the front desk did not care moving on so quickly that i did not even have a chance to ask for a cab
would i return to this hotel  most probably not",2.0
unremarkable in every respect,this place is beyond boring as far a accommodations go they do offer an extensive package of in room amenities on the house including a sewing kit and rain bonnet the beds are comfortable enough and there are lots of staff on hand to answer questions and such the elevators are slow and the weight room mediocre assuming other options are available i will not ever stay there again they did allow me to put down a 100 cash deposit when i forgot my credit card and there was no problem getting it back when i checked out in the morning,3.0
business traveller  conference,"i stayed at the argent september 11th14th attending a conference being held there rooms  were average  nothing really luxurious i saw a couple different rooms  the room set up seems to be quite varied conference facilities  the rooms were very cold the lunches were good although the morning and afternoon snacks were not varied at all day to day  not sure if this was a result of catering or the conference organizers location  well situated downtown  less than a 5 minute walk to union square  a 1015 cab fare to fishermans wharf service no problems checking in  i was able to have really early checkin room service and phone charges are a bit outrageous consierge was not overly helpful  we ended up going to the consierge at a different hotel to get further help 
overall  i agree with the last review  it is a hotel more geared to the business traveller i likely wouldnt stay there again unless i had a conference to attend there",3.0
great for the price,"did a name your own price on priceline and asked for a 3 star hotel got hojo was originally very upset as it is a 1 star hotel 
after our 4 night stay i must say it was a great overall experience for the value price and location it is a motel not a hotel so you must remember that but the room was clean and newly remodeled with nice furniture and detail there was free breakfast not the best but free the location is close to old town and seaworld would definitely stay at again",4.0
minimalist vs barren depressing and cheap,"i travel a lot to nyc every week tried the flatotel because of location the the promise of a minimalist decor dont know about you  i want clean and simple when i stay on a hotel 
on checking was upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the top floor it turns out this was the only room on the top floor  just my room and the gym
the room was enormous and sparsely furnished some of the furnishings were fine  many others looked like they were storing their group function crap in the room  folding chairs chipped tables etc 
it was pretty depressing sort of like a big dorm room with 12 nice pieces of furniture broken plugs and ac that wouldnt turn off in the living room no minibar inconsistent room service bread no bitter or no bread  but butter
basically pretty half assed for hotels in this price range id look elsewhere",3.0
definitely worth it,i had a red eye flight and turned up at 630am the staff were very accommodating and checked me in straight away earliest time i have ever checked in the room was clean and very comfortable the location was just off the magnificant mile great location overall it was worth staying at the only issue i might have was the cost of internet not all that cheap,4.0
great staff nice decor great rooms,not sure how people found so much to complain about i stayed here for a few days in march and had a great time the front desk staff were friendly and helpful when we asked them a million questions about where to eat and what to do for fun at weird hours the lobby had fun decor the lounge wasnt too bad drinks kinda pricey but friendly bartender aveda products in the room were great the room isnt huge but unless youve got two obese and clumsy people who need a suite in order to be comfortable youll find nothing to complain about really the only thing worth mentioning was that the toilet flushes loud but thats not really a big deal and at the hotwire rate under 100 this is a fantastic deal,4.0
great hotel and staff but be wary of other guests,"just got back from a weekend trip to nyc at the crowne plaza celebrated wifes birthday and taking kids to see christmas decorations the hotel is nice and well located we stayed on priority club points and the hotel sent complementary dessert to the room on my wifes birthday which was great room was well appointed and clean staff was very nice and hospitable
my only complaint was some drama going on with other guests around 1000 on saturday night there was a commotion in the hallway as a hurrican sandy victim was being removed from their room after fema funds had expired pretty noisy endeavor including nyc police secondally our neighbors got into loud arguements both nights we were there late at night after midnight which we were privelaged to hear as a result of the paper thin walls freaked our kids 7 and 4 out a bit not sure what the hotel could do about this kind of stuff but these events put a big damper on our stay there a maid told me they had been having trouble with fema recipients being good guests since they arrived be cautious",3.0
just average for downtown marriott although concierge lounge as above average,"stayed here for 3 nights recently am a marriott loyalist and basically choose marriott affliated hotels for all business travel however i found this hotel about as standard as any marriott downlown location i have recently stayed at 
first the location isnt great  would prefer to have more restuarants and other places nearby 
second while i was upgrade to concierge level as plat premier room was quite small and bathroom was downright tiny of course given that the hotel was likely built in late 70s or early 80s there isnt too much the hotel can do about room size but the reality is that folks expect larger rooms and at least better appointed bathrooms these days and the hotel doesnt have it bed if i recall was fine but nothing to write home about it
i did think the conceirge loungs was above average  better food options than a few hotel hotel lounges i have recently stayed at also beerwine was reasonble in lounge vs crazy expensive at some hotels
so i will probably stay here again for a few more upcoming business trips but only because i am getting marriott points",3.0
great hotel great location and very friendly staff,great hotel very friendly staff and were very accomodating to all visitors room was lovely and clean great location to central park fifth avenue and all the shops bar was good fun at night and the bar staff made us feel very welcome overall we had a great stay at this hotel and will definately return again soon,5.0
satisfactory but not spectacular,"the good news is that i won the hotel on priceline after indicating a baltimore inner habor choice though i was somewhat disappointed that we did not get a location very close to the waterfront the five or six blocks walk is easily done in decent weather we were welcomed efficiently but the desk staff person was not overly friendly and did not offer tips on what might be in the area or refer us to the concierge the decor of the lobby is a bit cold too even though the style is contemporary and has a great mural behind the front desk something more is needed to give a bit of warmth 
the room is on the small side for a 4 star hotel but the beds are very comfortable wifi service was good additionally we were pleased with the shower shampoo and lotions provided by the hotel the room was clean with the exception of the lamp which someone neglected to dust also we were missing items from the coffee making kit 
a couple of things marred our stay a bit firstthere was a future teachers convention there and several of the students were loud and raucous in the hallways and swimming pool like a frat party also the bellwoman there told me she would get us a taxi to the cruise port a mere two miles away and stopped the van of a driver she apparently knew not a standard taxi the fare should just be a few bucks within minutes i inquired about the price and was told 3000 when asked to be let out the driver brought the fare down to 20 i sincerely believe the bellwomandoorwoman knew this guy and was trying to get him extra business i did not like the one bit and feel it reflects badly upon the hilton 
the hotel does have potential and could be an even better venue if the management were to seriously consider the trends delinated in these reviews",3.0
best value for a true 312 star central seattle hotel,"we stayed the end of may and again in june may was a great valueaaa rate was 118night june was 134 but for a hotel of this type there was no better deal out there if you dont mind walking a quartermile its a great location because you can use the free tunnel bus to get around or when not free all buses are 2 
rooms are very spacious there are many more healthy choices for the free breakfast than for most places including real oatmeal internet was great room was a very spacious suite bed was very comfortable
ask for a room on the southwest side and it will be quieter and youll have a view of the space needle 
they give you free membership at the 24hour fitness across the street so i took a fun aerobics class
we took amtrak so i dont know about parking but its right off interstate 5",4.0
family vacation yes business travel not so much,"i read a review of this hotel comparing it to being on an old cruise ship and id say that is spot on its huge old and very crowded for a family vacation the location just south of downtown seems very nice as its close to millennium park shedd aquarium field museum adler planetarium etc in addition the amenities are niceincluding the pool fitness center and snack shop
the bad aspects for a single hhonors diamond traveler were as follows
i had to wait in line for 10 minutes checking in before anyone even spoke to me
i reserved a king bed room and was given a room with 2 full size beds
the executive lounge was a zoo both mornings i visited literally crawling with small children
i had to wait in line for 10 minutes in a huge line of people just to get a cab out of there
bottom line this place is overcrowded old and dated and overall just a big hassle for a single business traveller i would consider going back with my family i suppose but not sure its ultimately worth it given the age and overcrowding of this place",3.0
great place to stay,"to me drury inns are like hampton inns  theyre very consistent this one is one i could comment on more since i just stayed here for 11 nights it has a great location right on the northbound lanes of rt 6 and right next to i10 the room was clean comfortable quiet there are a lot of choices for tv viewing though i didnt have much time for that i like the fact that you can program the ac unit so that the fan keeps running even if the compressor shuts off im one of those who needs white noise to sleep
drurys provide breakfast and supper in my opinion breakfast is better because all of the normal breakfast foods are available  fruit cereals including hot oatmeal eggs pastries waffles pancakes etc etc supper is a little less exciting in that its mainly hot dogs chips etc they do provide a basic salad of mainly lettuce hot baked potatoes and tortilla chips are available too free soda is also offered after supper popcorn is offered so at least there is something available for supper if you dont have alternate plans
one wierd thing  the toilet where oh where are the normal toilets that flush normally in the mad rush to be green about everything many hotels have opted for whacko toilets that use less water the problem is that they often dont flush everything  and you wind up flushing 3 or 4 times to get everything down and use even more water and certainly more time 
one note of caution  this hotel is very easy to get to except if youre coming toward it on rt 6 from the north in that case follow these directions get off rt 6 on the two right lanes marked for i10 the exit ramp will crest a hill and then come down to the first light make sure you are in the third lane not in either of the left two lanes since both of them are left turn only i watched three people get tickets for going straight from lane 2 as soon as you go through this light get into the far left lane go through the next light at the third light make a left from the far left lane as though entering the ramp for i10 but make a uturn back onto the northbound lanes of rt 6 get into the far right lane since the drury will be just ahead past the first light confused sorry  hopefully not",5.0
i hated the hotel,the hotel is old and dirty they need to refurbish urgent and a nes staff the staff is very unfriendly and unpolite i never gonna stay at this hotel again and dont worth it i dont recommend for nobody the location is dangerous with a lot of homeless the bathroom seems like it was never clean with dusty and limo,1.0
hip and helpful,like you would expect from a w hotel the vibe is very hip from the water cascading down the walls in the lobby to the dimly lit living room on the 7th floor when you enter you feel like you have stumbled into an exclusive party which can be a bit intimidating but the staff makes you feel welcome at the front door i was greeted by eric who warmly welcomed me and escorted me and my bags to the checkin the front desk was also very friendly the room was on one of the higher floors and i had a great view of the city at night i loved the bliss bath products and the bed was very comfortable i had a great meal at blue fin and the fitness rooms sweat and stretch though small were well equipped i would suggest they put in a clock the rooms are a little dark if that is a consideration but otherwise i give this place high marks,4.0
classically elegant hotel with superb service,"we loved the langham my partner and i stayed here last week during emergency construction on our condo and we were made to feel very welcome during a stressful time we booked a room at 335 and were upgraded to a beautiful junior suite overlooking post office square  a very nice surprise
we found the hotel to be spotless and wellmaintained our junior suite was nicely appointed and had a homely english feel internet connection was fast and reliable 1295 a day  pretty typical for a secure connection bathroom was spotless and smallish but the toiletries box with everything that one could have forgotten  priceless only complaint is that there was too much junk on the already small desk
the bar in a word stunning possibly the best hotel bar we have ever visited huge crystal chandeliers comfy loungy seating stiff drinks for a price and polite bartenders  what more could one ask for
the health spa is smallish but well done and designed pool area has lots of natural light and the workout rooms have brand new equipment and are again spotless best of all no access fee
we easily recommend the langham",5.0
cold shower,"i know that nyc is an expensive city but i believe there needs to be certain standards to uphold to justify charging upwards of 300 per night no matter what city
the fact that my wife and i had to put up with cold showers one morning is just plain ridiculous given the money we were paying we put up with the fact that the room was tiny the cable tv didnt work and the bathroom had absolutely nowhere to hang anything but seriously cold showers when youre being charged 300 a night come on
whats worse the response from the front desk was well these things happen and there was no offer whatsoever of any compensation
nyc is a great city but was runied by my experiences in this hotel the fact that my sister got a great deal at the warwick hotel on w57th st via pricelinecom a wonderful 4 star establishment at almost half the price just goes to show how ridiculously overpriced this hotel is

location great  hotel not so much,location is the only thing that this hotel has going for it fabulous the staff was unhelpful except for concierge the room was shabby small and felt grungy carpet stained furniture beat up sheets dingy restroom tiny paper thin walls banging pipes noisy neighbors yes it is true that you dont spend much time in your room when you visit nyc but you do have to sleep there and that wasnt a very good experience in this place,1.0

a note of praise,i already reviewed this hotel as my favorite in downtown washington dc but want to share a positive experience i had a couple of weeks ago returning to the hotel one early evening i started to feel very sick because of food poisoning from a meal eaten elsewhere the next morning after a terrible night of pain and suffering i was dehydrated and in desperate need of a chicken broth to recuperate my exhausted body i called the front desk and was told that there were room services just for breakfast but considering my situation they would look into what they could do for me twenty minutes later to my surprise they send to my room a complimentary chicken broth along with some ginger ale which made me feel much better and able to go see a doctor after a good rest this is what i call excellent customer service,5.0

lovely clean and comfortable,"my teenage daughter and i spent 4 days and 3 nights in nyc last weekend after reading dozens of reviews and checking bedbug registry i chose the wyndham garden for our first ever stay in new york we were so pleased when we walked into our room it looked exactly like the picture on their website the bed was comfortable the linens were soft and clean the room was spotless i checked for bedbugs immediately and found none 
the staff is friendly and helpful the concierge gave us spot on advice for catching the correct subway and she booked our return shuttle to the airport the close proximity to both downtown and uptown subways made this an ideal location our first night we walked to the empire state building which is just blocks away there is a conveniently located major drugstore starbucks and other food places nearby
the only minor complain i would have is the shower curtain is too short and if you are not extremely careful water gets all over the bathroom floor otherwise i would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again",5.0
unless you are or think you are a rock star,"stayed for one night and one night only in late august 
the hotel was still in renovation mode but i believed it has come a long way over the past few months i checked in late at night and initially i thought i was in a wrong spot it felt like a night club at the entrance no lobby very dim lighting and several dark suits greeted us check in lobby turned out was on the 2nd floor and the process was quite smooth
what surprised me the most was the room it felt like they simply painted the walls white and rolled over some dark carpeting which looked worn already the bedroom was smallish and felt like i was sleeping next to the window since the gap between the bed and the windowwall was less than 6 inches the electric curtain was fun to play with but what surprised me the most was that light actually leaked out at the edges of the curtain so i was awaken by the morning light with the curtains closed before the morning call
overall if you want to party late at night and enjoy the rockstar lifestyle the hotel is great but if you want to get some sleep in the morning or perhaps to grab a cab at the door of the hotel there was no cab in the morning avoid the morning traffic uptown you may be better staying in soho or midtown",2.0
great place,"our family stayed here for one night on jan12 2008 we had traveled to dc on amtrak and walked from union station to the hotel on a nice sunny day but if it were a bad weather day we could have easily used the metro we were early so our room wasnt ready but the gentlemen at the front desk was very kind and told us to hang around in their very nice large lobby area and make ourselves a hot drink there was alot to choose from several different kinds of fresh coffee gourmet teas chai and hot chocolate the kids loved the large fish tank with beautiful exotic fish in it 
when we got our room we found it immaculately clean and very well appointed the beds were so plush and there was a mircofridge that evening the very helpful front desk guy recommended the chinatown gardens restaurant in nearby china town it was only a couple blocks away we were there early 430pm and already it was getting full great food
that evening we purchased ice cream in the very well stocked little store the hampton inn has on the property
the only negative was a group of cheerleaders who were staying at the hotel for a convention all evening they were very loud and we didnt say anything but at 11 pm they were still being very loud so i opened our door and found them in the hall near the elevator doing their cheerleading they were even doing cartwheels in the hall i kindly asked them to stop and they did for a while then about 30 min later they started again someone had called security and within minutes a guard was there and it stopped
the next morning at checkout i had mentioned that our stay was wonderful except for the loud girls and i thanked them for sending a guard up to stop it this was not the fault of the hotel but the nice front desk guy took 20 off our already good room rate for the trouble
great location too we would definately stay here again and recommend this hotel

expected a bit more from flatiron hotel,had a one night stay at the flatiron hotel a boutique style hotel in new york city the address on 26th st close to 5th avenue was its best asset as far as i was concerned it was close to where i needed to be as the next day my daughters final fitting at kleinfelds bridal was within easy walking distance madison square park shake shack and eataly nearby which i like i thought the hotel was good but not great for these reasons upon walking into the hotel for checkin after 930 pm the ground floor entrance was interesting especially the exotic round cylinder fish tank running up the middle of the room however the band playing in the lounge which is open to the checkin area was absolutely blasting so unnecessarily loud we felt bad for the clerk who must have hearing loss by this time thankfully checkin was so quick we got our room keys and quickly got out of there security while traveling is important to me so i was disappointed that anyone could enter the elevators and go up to our floor without restriction our room was practically across the elevator and the hallway was quite narrow in favor of a rather large size room two queen beds in this room with very high tray ceilings and ornate crown molding the beds while stylishly decorated especially the headboards with decorative curtains on either side were not as comfortable as ive had for the price and the mattresses were hard but some like it that way nice pillow selection and nice sheets the beds were platform beds with drawers for storage so i promptly banged my leg on the corner of the platform the rest of the furniture in the room in my opinion was cheap looking nothing special im used to minibars but this one the clerk actually warned us about it upon checkin saying that you only have 20 seconds and if the sensor picks up that something is not in its place youre getting charged that includes a sensor for dry snacks on top which look like theyre in an ordinary tray  theyre not needless to say didnt touch either one cup at a time coffee maker lousy coffee theres a starbucks a stones throw from the hotel much better there is a restaurant which i assume serves meals in the same location that becomes the lounge for entertainment in the evenings i didnt have any meals there the little extras that did not impress me was a tv in the mirror of the bathroom you had to shut the door to get in front of the sink so the only time you might want to watch it is while washing you face etc since you cant see it unless you are standing right in front of it the shower was very nice with a large rainshower head optional jets for lower body plenty of towels etc but no where to hang them except one hook on the back of the door toilet small very low air conditioning very good robes in wardrobe closet lighted buttons for do not disturb or to request housekeep very large windows running the width of the room with motorized curtains free wifi and nice large lg flat screen tv on the wall clean room but definitely wouldnt say immaculate seems like a lot of stuff that might appeal to some but when it came down to it i decided ill stay somewhere different next time,3.0
historical district jewel with excellent location,my wife and i stayed at the adolphus for business and personal travel we requested a regular and asked for an upgrade to a king executive suite upon arrival unfortunately they were out of the king executive suite but we were upgraded to a 2 doubles executive suite on a high floor the room was very spacious had a great view and everything we needed the furniture is old but that is keeping with the historical nature of the hotel the lobby and bars are clean well laid out and the service was very good particularly the valet guys who got to know us and our car very well overall we would definitely consider staying at the adolphus again next time were in downtown dallas,4.0
decent but not anxious to return,"this brandnew hotel is located close to 9th avenue with the port authority bus station across the street and a number of adult shops just up the block there is ongoing construction on the corner which makes for noise whenever you leave the hotel plus you have to negotiate all the scaffolding it is not a pretty block 
however the proximity to the hells kitchen neighborhood is actually wonderful many great restaurants on 9th and 10th avenues and you can walk to the hudson where you can rent bicycles walk along the riverfront or visit the intrepid battleship museum in just a few minutes
the hotel itself is nice enough rooms are clean and comfortable staff though arent of the go the extra mile breed to be fair the lobby is tiny and it must be tough to manage guests in such a small space
in conclusion it is a decent place to stay we got a promotional rate and used points for a fournight stay so we got a very good value but if we werent using points i imagine wed use priceline to stay somewhere better",3.0
historic building outstanding service,"i booked the riverwalk vista based on the other reviews i saw on trip advisor coming in for business over several days the riverwalk was even more than i had expected it may not be for everyone but for some it probably doesnt get much better 
the riverwalk is a historic building which is about a 5 iron from the convention center and a chip shot from the river walk there are 17 rooms in a 3 story building overlooking downtown san antonio the charm and magic of this hotel is all inside from the hardwood floors throughout along with rustic furniture in every room there is an immediate comfort feeling when you walk in
if you are looking for a hilton or marriott with bell hops concierge and restaurant inside this is not the place for you you are however given some things that are special breakfast made each morning that is fresh and unique cookies at 300 and wine at 500 joan and the rest of the staff are attentive and helpful free internet is a plus and you can relax in the common area or find a cozy leather chair to camp out and read or work 
when you travel for work and get burned out of the same old cookie cutter chain hotel the riverwalk vista is a great change i",4.0
nice hotel good location,this hotel is in good position to visit sf just 2 blocks from union square offer nice rooms good restaurant and good service inlcuding wine  cheese free from 5 to 6 pm i recommend for the people wants a central base to visit the city you can walk and see most of attractions excluding the golden gate to see it you need a taxi about 15 usd the race or the public bus just 2 usd i also recommend to park the car if you have one in the parkings surrounding the hotel which are less expensive then valet parking of bw hotel it cost 31 usd,4.0
perfect for the family,"we stayed at this lovely hotel in aug 06 with our family of
5 kids we had 2 suites which were adjoining and perfect for our family they were newly renovated and in excellent condition the bathrooms are new the beds are fluffy and fresh the staff was friendly and accomodating we had excellent service the valet inparticular was so helpful with our car always going in and out in the city the location is excellent in the city right off of
michigan avenue could not have had a better area in the city it was very residential but accessible to all the pool was great for the kids and room service was always good we felt so fortunate to have found this great spot with our big family 
we would def go back",5.0
could be betterbut not bad,"i traveled here for business and it was for an overnight stay ive always checked in at night and the setting is always calm the lighting is relaxing in the main lobby and in the elevator the two times that i stayed here the interaction with the staff was soso i sensed that they were being nice to me because i was so nice to them but had i been unhappy with something that had to do with the hotel they wouldnt be very helpful or concerned they do have a place downstairs where you can checkin for your flight and print your boarding pass however internet and printerfaxcopier machine usage in the business center one computer and internet in your room come at a cost you can get free internet if you sit in the lobby with your computer but thats it i think thats kinda lame why only put free internet in an area of your hotel 
the rooms that ive stayed in were nice enough the last room i was in seemed smaller that the first time i dont know if it was because it was at the end of the hall or what but it felt a little compact 
i will compliment the shuttle drivers though they have always been nice and personable 
so basically it hasnt been great but it wasnt horrible for me so if you plan on staying here you may love it but you also may end up feeling like you could find somewhere better the next time your in town",3.0
a tad bit better than the reviews,normally before i book a room i read the reviews actually this hotel was a little better than the reviews for financial security i did not book online but went in and checked out the room prior to booking it was a little smelly but housekeeping sprayed air freshner and that took care of that if i had to complain about anything it would be the bathroom having no window otherwise not bad for the money ryan was great,3.0
it only has the location as its plus,"we stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in sept 12 location wise it couldnt be better youre just off 7th avenue and times square if you dont care about the room sizes room service cleanliness and smelly hallways then this is for you
after visiting vegas and miami we were quite shocked by the tiny little rooms sharing a room is almost impossible 
although the room was cleaned on a daily basis the staff always forgot to leave back either towels toilet paper and take the rubbish 
the elevator foyer on 6th floor is disgustingly smelly i would definitely recommend not staying on this floor 
the wifi is great and very fast but you have to log on every few minutes  by day 1 we knew the username and password of by heart 
id recommend this hotel to young kids on a budget as it certainly does not have any luxury whatsoever",3.0
small but ok for my needs,"we booked this hotel via a special package deal through a travel agent when my travelling companion and i arrived i found the hotel room to be small we were booked into room 751 right next to the elevators the room looked out onto the interior courtyard and contained two single beds a desk desk chair tv on a stand a night stand and another arm chair the closet contained a chest of drawers that did not fit in the main space the bathroom was small but clean and it had been updated 
all in all the room was clean and workable for our needs we spent most of our vacation out seeing the city not stuck inside especially since we paid 12000night as part of our package if i was into spending alot of time in the room i think that i would have found it too small 
day 1 the tv remote didnt work very well and our window was broken despite being closed the upper pane kept slipping open at approximately 1 am we finally got frustrated with the window and called the front desk a security officer showed up after two calls to the front desk the gentleman was very nice but he was unable to fix the window we ended up having to change rooms at 130 am to room 951 it was a litlle frustrating but the new rooms windows were fine the evenings activities ended with the intermittent noise of toilets flushing and water running which we could hear very loudly through the walls 
day 2 the shower had a partial glass pane that the extended only 2 feet from the wall and allowed the water to spray all over the floor the only way to prevent a flood was to shower in the corner all hunched over after that the hairdryer made alot of noise but it didnt give off any heat to speak of 
day 3 and 4 we got used to the loud sounds of toilets and water and all in all the beds were confortable enough the staff members were nice and the hotel felt safe 
i would probably stay somewhere else in nyc if the price was right but for the money the jolly was alright oh and the moonstruck diner across the street does offer a good relatively cheap especially for new york breakfast",3.0

amazing time out in the big apple,"you might be reading several negative reviews on this amazing newyork hotel around here but i have to confirm the opposite we had a wonderful stay at the barclay back in may this year in a king executive room which was simply perfect 
front desk staff was friendly and more or less helpful when i asked for a room located as high as possible my request got rejected saying room had already been assigned concierge always smiling and offering their assistance
the lobby speaks for itself spacious elegant smelling of fresh flowers 247 as soon as you step inside you feel like you are back home 
the room was not huge but it was just enough for a nyc hotel room the bed was comfortable and i just loved their linen this is the point when staying at intercontinental or a cheaper chain makes a difference our room was on the 11th floor if my memory is right facing lex and the noise level during the night really wasnt as bad as many claim bathroom was neat and clean and to my greatest pleasure there was a spacious wardrobe with plenty of hangers
yes the tv is a bit dated but who wants to watch television when in newyork definitely not me
location could not be better within walking distance to all sights you might want to see except for the statute of liberty but you can survive a ride on the metro grand central 5th avenue rockefeller center times square all within 510 mins walk
i would surely recommend this fab hotel and cant wait for my next visit

a true landmark hotel in san francisco,"i stayed here on a business trip and it was truly a pleasure the location was perfect albeit very busy the timing was a mixed blessing because it was right before christmas the decor was breathtaking and all the surrounding shops were at the holiday best it was a feast for the eyes and senses good thing i planned on walking to the moscone center and not driving anywhere it would have been nearly impossible to exit the hotel and get away from union square
i stayed in the new tower but had wanted to stay in the older part of the hotel the new tower had the newer amenities without losing the charm of the hotel spacious room standard amenities and the room was very clean and quiet big plus for work travel i also really liked their gym extra cost but it was a real gym with lots of room and equipment the tread mills had individual tis for those who do watch tv when they walkrun the only part that was a bit rough for me was walking through the beautiful lobby and checkin area to get back to my room in the tower after a work out 
two things that i would like to point out as to why this hotel was excellent 1 i loved the fact that the hotel made a true effort to highlight its rich history with beautiful photographs and pieces presented like a museum display i really enjoyed taking my time reading about some of the pieces and looking at the ansel adams photographs the clock is still in prominent display and the annual christmas sugar castle at the entrance is every childs dream lovely
2 the hotel provided a choice and true incentive for people to be green for the days that you dont request a sheet change they still make your bed you have a choice to add westin points or a coupon to use at the coffee stand in the lobby i felt that this was a good idea to give the customer something back for helping them and also the environment
i will absolutely stay here again",5.0
great location nice hotel,i thought the hotel was great overall  although its an older hotel its keep up nicely and the staff were very helpful my only complaint is that they dont have an outdoor pool i didnt do enough research and really missed being able to enjoy the weather at my hotel instead i went to barton springs,4.0
nice location downtown jacksonville fl  wyndham riverwalk,"we were going to jacksonville to go to the zoo and wanted someplace close we selected the downtown are in pricelines name your own price option picked 3 stars and offered 70 to see what we would get we got the wyndham riverwalk hotel it was normally 114 a night although other three star hotels in the area where asking quite a bit more the location was excellent right on the river near lots of restaurants and i95 its part of the riverwalk a pleasant place to walk or jog and see downtown jacksonville the hotel is about 1015 minutes to the zoo along the river there are places to take a water taxi over to jacksonville landing a semicircular mall with lots of shops restaurants and weekend events 
we normally stay at travelodge or something similar and generally pay around 35 aside from being much larger with a better location we found the wyndham to be on a par with one of those motels it didnt seem like a three star hotel but considering the location neither did the price
we had heard that the hotel was in the process of being refurbished but apparently they hadnt gotten to our room yet the bathroom door was cracked and peeling the coat hanger was coming off the wall the carpet needed replacing and the closet door came off the track but the room seemed clean enough and had everything we needed including a closet full of extra pillows and blankets our room was on the second floor over the bar in the lobby and we could hear the crowd at night but we didnt hear any of our neighbors and the bathroom blocked the bar noise well enough for us to sleep without complaint
our window gave us a spectacular view of the air conditioning unit over the first floor but we hadnt asked for a room with a view a room on any higher floor would get a lovely view of the river and the many bridges and impressive skyline we also forgot to ask for a non smoking room and so ours smelled strongly of smoke just inside the door im sure they would have moved us if we had asked the lady at the counter was friendly and helpful we didnt try room service or either of their restaurants we did go to the tastings which is on their property to get a picnic for our room also within easy walking distance along the river is the chart house ruths chris steakhouse and river city brewing company there is a pool which seemed clean and pleasant with a couple of comfy hammocks off to the side there is also a fitness center available but we stuck with the hammocks 
if you choose them i would advise asking for a room with a veiw or on the third or fourth floor",4.0

well worth a visit,the rancho bernardo inn is one of those resorts at which you need to stay for several days to unwind and enjoy the amenities unfortunately i was there for only one night and that on business from my brief stay though i saw that it is a warm inviting resort consisting of a cluster of smallish buildings connected by winding garden paths there are numerous small fountains and tranquil gardens scattered throughout the lobby is an upscale rustic southwestern decor with an open fireplace very inviting and comfortable the property is reached by driving to the far end of a residential area meaning that there is no street traffic or noise the rooms are extremely comfortable and are well equipped for business travelers the inn automatically charges an all inclusive fee so you dont have to pay extra for wireless internet access in the room or throughout the property the hotels business center was not all that well equipped but the rancho bernardo town center with a kinkos is nearby it was a great location for our small business meeting and i can see where a few days here could be very relaxing,4.0
well treated at the hyatt regency,"excellent service by all support staff i want to especially compliment the bell staff they went out of their way to help me and were extremely respectful all staff who answered questions on the phone or at any of the desks including the fitness center responded to me by name or asked how they might help me 
i asked for a room on a upper level and they made sure i had a view of the mountains i was there for a conference
did not use the hotel eatery or bar since i wanted to venture out to the 16th st pedestrian mall i was somewhat disappointed in lack of variety and had trouble finding place to eat breakfast but did go to the sante fe ave area and was immensely pleased with the art shops and galleries an up and coming area some of the locals are just now discovering too the clerks and staff at one of the restaurants and chicano center for the arts near the museum de la americas were helpful and courteous you must go take a bus or taxi to get there 
we did have trouble with getting prompt taxi service from that district back to hotel however the bus was actually faster and cheaper

second visit even better,this time around the elevators were done in terms of renovation the hotel accommodated my request for the same room as previously occupied large with a little sitting area sink and fridge just perfect excellent value as well right across from gwu and a short walk to georgetown perfect location the staff is very pleasant and courteous the only problem we encountered was the wifi which simply did not work despite calls and several tries with the it service which was a problem however this is a great boutique hotel and we will definitely return on our next visit to dc,5.0

very pleased,we stayed at this hotel overnight awaiting an early morning connection to central america we traveled with our two young sons aged 5 and 7 we found this hotel easily accessible from the houston airport with good signage within the airport to direct us to get there the hotel was clean good bed linens and comfortable beds the rooms were satisfactory in size the bathroom in our room was a bit dated but certainly very clean the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly unfortunately in the room adjacent to us were guests who were up at 3am and making considerable noise likely in preparation for an early morning flight and we heard more from them than the airplanes outside my only real wish with this hotel is that they have some sort of display in the lobby to direct guests to the appropriate terminal for their flights as i imagine many stay overnight like us in transit to other locations luckily for us we ran into a flight attendant at the train who looked up our flight for us and directed us straight away to the right terminal we didnt realize this was possible until we stayed at the newark liberty airport marriott on our way back and realized that they had such a display in their lobby and i thought what a great idea overall we got value for our money the convenience especially when traveling from abroad with young children could not be beat and our room met our expectations we would stay here again,4.0

we stayed in one of the one bedroom suites which was very spaciousabout 800 square feet it had a large living area dining area and smallish but functional kitchen the bathroom was nice and the king sized bed was very comfortable there was also lots of storage
the pool area is very nice and the staff will regularly bring you popsicles the continental breakfast is absolutely delicious and is supplied by a local bakery 
it is within walking distance of the hollywood walk of fame and magic castle shows are free to guests although unfortunately we were not able to take advantage of this",5.0
renovated rooms but far from,i stayed for 6 nights at the park central hotel as i had it recommended from a friend but it did not live up to my expectations my room was suppose to be newly renovated but that was really difficult to see the air condition was an old larming machine in the corner and the bath room was really torn down the room was rather dirty and although i am used to various standard at hotels worldwide i felt that paying close to 300  per night you should at least expect a clean room when complaining at the front desk the reaction from the rather unfriendly personnel was negative and i had to remain in the room attemps to improve cleaning seemed to fail or this was just the standard of the hotel my room was located at 18th floor and since only one levator was in work during that week you had wait for up to 20 minutes to get up or down the only really positive thing to say about this hotel is the location  close to central park,2.0
good hotel great location,the st giles tuscany is a good hotel with a great location its dated  and feels very much like a w hotel which it was that never got updated since the late 90s which it likely hasnt that said the rooms are huge the beds are comfortable and the staff is extra fun and friendly located in midtown near grand central you are never more than a quick walk cab or subway ride away from anything in the city overall the price was right  and although nothing blew me away i would stay here again,3.0
very nice accomodations clean and convenient,first of all i am a returns member and generally stay at a laquinta 34 times a year the dia location is by far one of the nicest we stayed there three years ago and our experience both times was the samegreat you cannot beat the location and accessibility there is a ruby tuesday restaurant next door and the surroundings are very clean and upscale the the hotel itself is very clean and everyone was so friendly and helpful very nice facilities including indoor pool and spa the laquinta included breakfast was great and was available at 400am we chose this location the same as three years ago to cap our weeks vacation in colorado before flying home the next morning from walking out the door of the laquinta we were dropping our car off at the auto rental in less than 10 minutes we will certainly be back,5.0
it was just what we needed,"my two teenage children and i stayed at the magic castle for 4 nights after reading lots of different hotel reviews i was very happy with our decision as the staff were friendly and very helpful 
we had a one bedroom suite and my only comment would be that because the suite was right in the corner  opposite the reception it was a little dark it was not easy to keep the blinds open as the table outside is where breakfast was eaten 
the rooms were spacious and the kitchen great as we could prepare or bring in what ever we needed the hotel is well located and the staff helped with directions on how to get to anywhere you wanted and would take time to explain things
i would have liked to know about the ability to visit the show at the magic castle when i booked as it requires formal attire which i did not have with me but would have bought if i had known ask about this if you are thinking of going
the breakfast was good and it suited me that i could take it to our room for the kids as they did not rise as early as me i would definately go again",4.0
wonderful experience,stayed here with my daughter to celebrate her 40th birthday we loved it no car needed because it was so centrally locatedshort walks to fishermans wharf embarcadero union square etc and the staff had excellent advice on all sorts of things they went out of their way to be a step above the rest,5.0
tiny notsoclean room that smelled of cheeseburgers,nyc is a difficult city to find an affordable easy place to stay but i wouldnt stay here again the room was tiny it smelled bad and apart from the room being painted like alice in wonderland it really had no charm,2.0
amazing hotel great location,"i bought a deal off of livingsocialcom i travelled with my dad to chicago so we could watch my sister compete in the mic gymnastics championships the raffaello hotel is in a great location a little off a side street so all the main traffic isnt in front of the hotel all you have to do is walk a block and you are in front of the john hancock center and a big intersection of michigan avenue we arrived early around 1200pm ish and nothing was ready as i did request a higher floor so the front desk staff was amazing and held our bags for us as we walked around for a few hours we came back around 3 and our room still wasnt going to be available until 430500 however they did say they had a handicap room available immediately on lower floor to be honest i was exhausted and so i said we would take it great idea our room had plenty of extra space to move around in my dad fell asleep as soon as he laid down on the bed i took a nap too the beds are very comfy with the nice thick but soft pillows something i noticed was the fanair conditioning it was on my side of the room and i turned it up full blast and it hardly made any noise at all this was a huge plus for methere were plenty of outlets for me to charge up all my electronics after the flight and before the meet i enjoyed playing with the ihome and my ipod touch  the bathroom was large i dont know if it is like that in all the rooms or just because we had a handicap room the shower was my absolute favorite it is a rainfall shower head but it still had plenty of pressure unlike others i have experienced 
i didnt try out the barrestaurant or anything else really in the hotel as we were there for only one night i did think the cool water sitting out for anyone was a great idea though and the beautiful flowers in the lobby the nice guys at the door helped us get to a couple places we were looking at walking to and quickly getting us a cab when we needed it 
overall i will most definitely be going back thank you to the staff at the raffaello",5.0
nice newly renovated hotel adjoining lax,courtyard hotels are not everyones cup of tea but i enjoy their pragmatic design built with the business traveler in mind and overall comfort this courtyard has just completed a major renovation and it is a fresh and attractively remodeled hotel the colors are new and vibrant rooms have nice amenities staff was very friendly and attentive our room was very quiet and we had a good but short nights sleep didnt eat here so couldnt comment on this free shuttle leaves for lax every 15 minutes a very helpful feature parking is very limited and expensive if you bring a car as its limited and all valet but if you just want an overnight before heading out early in the morning this is an excellent choice,4.0
beautiful new property,"great brand new property cool design trendy rooms fun decor comfortable beds spacious rooms nice view of the river
the nicest renaissance ive seen hands down
the only downside to this property is the location there isnt much around the hotel be prepared to take a cab if you need a drugstore or anything that you cant get at 711",5.0
new york new york so good they named it twice,"now as an englishman in new york i understand there are several protocols one has to observe according to sting i dont drink coffee i drink tea my dear  and i like my toast done on one side 
now forgive me dear reader but who the blue heck has toast only done on one side i have been an englishman abroad many a time from nairobi to new york to naples and not once  ever  have i met anyone who likes one sided toast strike one for your travel advice mr sting you will be deleted from my ipod playlist post haste
the only other travel advice about travelling to new york is from the jeeves and wooster tv series where jeeves adopts a voice of grave concern and advises poor old bertie wooster that gentlemen do not wear straw hats in the metropolis sir well i dont own a straw hat either so im safe on that score
straw hatless and sans toast i was still none the wiser about what to do when travelling to new york so in true hopeless man style i devolved responsibility to my girlfriend who triumphantly announced over breakfast one morning that we were to stay in the times square hilton i was so excited i nearly choked on my both sides done toast 
it was a lovely midaugust day in new york city when we arrived as you arrive through the double doors you are hit by the efficient air conditioning and have to do a strange dogleg around the corner and up a lift to the mezzanine level where the reception desk is situated but its all well signposted its also the location of quite a fun looking bar but sadly the view from the bar windows is of the even more fun looking new york city so apart from one drink i cannot comment on the bar as i was much too busy in the city that never sleeps 
in case you were wondering the drink was an american beer called budweiser and very nice it was too it made me feel so american i wanted to invade a small country and install democracy in it while eating a chili dog
anyway  being a bit of an american virgin i was quite unprepared for the rocket ship speeds of your lifts elevators to my room and being on the 34th floor i was expecting this to take quite a while it does not you are propelled at high speed towards the sky in american lifts 
i sincerely believe that in all high rise hilton hotels after you have pressed the button for your floor a little voice should announce 321blast off i would willingly pay extra money for this feature however if you are lazy and press the button only for the next floor up the little voice should announce your weight thus shaming you into exercise i digress 
anyway after my exciting rocket shiplift ride i found my way to the hotel room with my long suffering girlfriend by my side in true hilton style it was extremely nice and very comfortable there was a jolly nice bathroom in white two queen beds were in the middle of the bedroom and there was a television with a wide range of channels for any british people you will be pleased to know that bbc world news and bbc entertainment both feature should you suddenly need to feel all british and watch doctor who suddenly
room tv channels and straw hats aside what is really great about this hotel is the location if its your first time to new york city like me this is the place to start exploring from if you go out of the front entrance you are literally immediately propelled into the throng of new york and very exciting it is too all the big attractions are only a short distance walk away there is a tube sorry subway station round the corner where you can get to anywhere else and there are plentiful taxis in the street as well
so in a nutshell what do you get by booking here well you get some lovely staff the concierge in the lobby was excellent in helping me find a new york city helicopter tour a super room to the usual hilton chain high standard and all the excitement of living in the very heart of new york city 
new york new york  so good they named it twice based on that logic the hotel should really be called the hilton hilton youll have a lovely time 
right im off to listen to alicia keys and put myself back in a new york state of mind much better than sting his advice was rubbish",4.0
comfy hotel,stayed here for a week on business rooms were clean and the bed comfortable everything was in good repair the staff was extremely friendly and helpful would return here again gym was a bit lacking,5.0
the best front desk in town,the baldwin is a nofrills immaculately clean hotel with simple rooms and baths and a fabulous location its pretty plain and the public areas are almost nonexistent what sets it apart is the staff especially the unfailing kindness and efficiency of the wonderful chester im sorry i dont know his full name at the front desk the clientele is international and many folks are there for longer stays so the vibe is relaxed and friendly without that forced bb jocularity its a great value,4.0
who knew,i had no idea that this fabulous and affordable hotel was located in the heart of it all the staff were very friendly and the room was perfect no real frills but everything was just what i needed and wanted clean rooms soft comfy bed spalike shower beautiful view of the city internet and a gym best of all  it was affordable highly recommend this hotel,4.0
dont stay here if you can help it,this is without a doubt the worst conference hotel i have ever stayed in and i have been to a lot of conferences the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable the bathroom had the usual sign about saving the world by not changing the linens every day but there were no towel racks upon which to hang said linenson the one wall where there should have been a rack there was a picture of a cactus there was exactly one hook next to the tub i am a hilton honors member and as such i get free bottled water just for being a member i am also a hyatt gold passport member which got me a bottle of water in the room that was mine for only 600 in phoenix in june my membership was also supposed to get me a paper which i never got the service in the restaurant upstairs was pretty bad we ordered at 700 but didnt get our dinner until 830 at which point i was ready to eat my napkin but the worst was the temperature in the room when we got there it was in the 80s and we couldnt get the thermostat to work we called and asked them to fix it when we got back from our meetings later that evening the temperature was in the low 60s and still going down with the fan on highit was like being in a meat locker i called at 9 to ask them to fix it then called at 930 and again at 10 finally at 1015 i lost it and called once again asking for someone to come immediately at 1030 someone finally came to fix the thermostat the only thing good i can say about the hotel is that it is convenient to the conference center period,1.0
my 1st pick when i stay in the city,"love the location near a great new york bar aces a very nice restaurant brick saha is quite fabulous food also and the bevmo down the street doesnt hurt either
lived in sf for a while and used to pick hotels in the neighbourhood that i lived in
but now whenever i visit it is the hotel carlton that gets my business
friendliest staff nice size rooms anything you might need is easily accessible",5.0
what a great place to stay,this hotel has just undergone remodeling at first i was set back by the detached buildings but by the second night they grew on me and i enjoyed my stroll down the sidewalks to my room its like staying at a resort they had a complimentary managers reception that included beer  wine and a buffet of real food rooms are like small apartments and they have flat screen tvs in the bed rooms breakfast was included in the room price and it really hit the spot with real food again not just cereal bagels and waffles but oatmeal eggs sausage and potatoes also people who stay there seem more social that most places i go they seemed to stay long in the lobby area with their laptops to do casual work or just be there to watch the community tvs,5.0
worked well with our kids,"i booked this hotel thru priceline and got a rate of 175 per night for 2 nights which i thought was wonderful the day before we went i called to see if we could get a rollaway in our room since we had 3 kids luckily i called because they had us booked in a room with one queen bed not good the man i spoke to said he switched us to a room with 2 queens but no room for a rollaway this would work since our 3 yr old usually ends up in our bed anyway so we would just start that way and our 6 and 9 yr old boys could share a bed 
we walked with our luggage from penn station and halfway there wished we got a cab not realizing it was so far miscounted a couple of avenues when we were planning promised our kids we would get a cab back when it was time to check out we got to the shelburne at 1pm to stowe our luggage but they let us check in unfortunetely the room change wasnt really made and they still had us in one queen victoria at the desk was very very helpful after checking a couple of rooms for us we checked into a roof top room that are normally not available in the summer because of their bar but the winter they were perfect with a view of the river and empire state building we ended up with a king and a rollaway bed the older boys switched between the rollaway and a soft lounge chair with ottaman not the best if the kids were older but worked fine for us 
loved ny city but wont go again at christmas since all the lines were crazy we grew up near by long island and my husband used to work in the city his funniest comment was that it was nice that the city was now so clean and low crime but because of that more people came in and it was too crowded for him to enjoy
we recommend this hotel highly",4.0
wow downtown ny location,if you are visiting 911 memorial this is a perfect hotel to stay in the hotel faces the entrance to the memorial and be sure to sip at the lobby bar or even better the outdoor balcony for a superb view of one wtc and the other upcoming wtc towers inspite of the the on going construction which doesnt really bother me the area is bustling with tourist and within minutes of soho and lower east side the wtc subway station is minutes away nearby century 21 or the lexington line is a couple of blocks on broadway the 5 th floor lobby is ideal and feels isolated from the main tourist traffic and 911 memorial crowd unlike the other nearby hotels the wonderfulspectacular rooms are fairly designed and seems normal with enclosed bathroom unlike some of the other ws we had a corner room facing south east the service is just about average and somewhat cold at the front desk but that didnt really bother me since im not a high demanding guest and dont expect too much in terms of service and attention however some may find it to be rude and unattentive at night ther area tend to be on a quiet side after the memorial closes nevertheless you could gawk at the brightly lighted 1wtc tower from the lobby bar balcony the lobby has a good selection of costly drinks and nibbles we we fortunate to have a package deal which offered complimentary drinks heading out to nearby soho is about a 1520 min walk or a short subway ride i give this 5 just for the location and property but 4  for the service would consider staying here again when in nyc note if visiting the memorial  make sure to reserve free online tickets for designated time slot entry to the memorial,5.0
a gem in the heart of the city,the hotel is a real gem bostons back bay is just out the front doorstep it is located across the street from the boston public library and a few steps from copley square and the subway stop the room i stayed in was compact but had everything i needed classical music from the stereo system in the room greeted me as i entered which i thought was a nice touch it was clean stylish and quiet the hotel provides tea and coffee in the evenings and a light breakfast in the mornings computers are available for internet access and wifi is available for those who have their own wifi compatible laptops the hotel staff were very accommodating pleasant and informative and the price cant be beat in such an expensive location it is a great hotel for the cost anytime im in boston in the future the charlesmark is where im going to stay,5.0
perfect location for partying and sightseeing great value,"we looked for ages for a manhattan hotel within our budget that wasnt icky this one came in on a good deal through expedia and we jumped at it four star at 3 star prices lovely hotel nice rooms all as described on their web site
the only reason i have marked down the cleanliness is that the mirrors in the lifts were a bit smeared
the only reason i have marked down the rooms is that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but hey walking around the block takes you to a dunkin donuts starbucks subway and an independent deli open 24 hours
the only reason i have marked down the service is that the staff did once allow their tension with each other to show in front of guests at one point but this was an isolated incident and overall we were very pleased with the service",4.0

1st class attention,we stayed at the argonaut hotel for two nights in a queenqueen room the room was spacious and extremely clean we had a wonderful view from our room of the golden gate bridge all the staff we encountered at the argonaut were professional and attentive the wine hour is not to be missed i would definitely stay here again,5.0
inexpensive heaven,i got in at the hilton garden for an incredible price below 80 on hotwire it was wonderful the bed was a thick cloud i had more pillows than i could ever use and a giant tv after wondering philly all day it was exciting to get back to that comfortable bed,5.0
wonderful customer service,"i traveled with girlfriends to the hamilton crowne plaza for a weekend trip in may it was absolutely wonderful our important booking factors were price point and location to restaurant entertainment and historic sites both were great and true to what i had previously researched the customer service at the hotel blew me away check in was quick easy and so very nice the front desk agent greeted me with a smile and actually made conversation with me it was wonderful our room was exactly how it was advertised online and in reviews everything worked really well although the ac took some time to get going the concierge innocent was the most customer oriented person i have ever met and i am in the business he made suggestions for dinner drinks and late night activities he called ahead to get us reservations on a friday night at a really fantastic restaurant he even went as far as to send us drinks at the restaurant 
i know i mentioned it above but i work for a 4 diamond luxury property and i took notes from this hotel for my own property i am used to amazing service with quality behind it and that is exactly what we experienced all weekend i cant rave about the hotel enough definitely a wonderful place for friends and families i would bring my husband and young daughter back as we were in a great location to walk to some of the dc sites the only minor problem was the smell of sewer that ran through the lobby occassionally it could get pretty strong but wasnt bad enough to deter us from anything",4.0
great hotel,"we stayed for four nights in late july our trip was a special occassion  belated honeymoon  and we recieved an upgrade to a club level room and chocolates and honey in our room on arrival lovely touches 
our room was sizeable with a huge and extremly comfortable bed and great tv which had loads of movie choices 
the food in the club lounge was perfect  lots of fresh fruit for brekkie a great cheese selection for lunch and oatmeal cookies that im still having withdrawal symptoms from
staff were extremly professional and friendly from reception to doormen
the location is also very convenient its about a seven minute walk to union square easier on the way to the square than back as the hotel is on nob hill giving you a free workout while walking back and just a block from the historic cable cars which take you to fishermans wharf on one side and chinatown on the other
would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to friends",5.0
my fourth stay and ill be back,the palomar dallas is one of the most comfortable hotels i have stayed in combining modern luxury an excellent position friendly and helpful staff and every facility you could want from pool to spa to free wifi and courtesy tea and coffee this was my fourth stay within a year and i will definitely be back,5.0

loved the blake amenities and location,"got a killer deal with their february promotion of 129night 
was a little concerned with some of the previous reviews about noise and such but they appear to be corrected as my stay was relaxing
the room was spacious the king sized bed was extremely comfortable the ipod docking was a nice bonus and the walkinshower even had the same grohe rainshower head that i have at home
the custom house restaurant which is attached to the hotel is a little pricey but i highly recommend it

clean room small good service,stayed here on business and it was the best i could get for our company rate the location is pretty good the staff is friendly and helpful the room was clean but small and old nice updated tho like a flatscreen tv and good wifi id give them a 3,3.0
very helpful staff and very nice hotel,the staff really went out of their way for you very helpful and friendly the room was a bit small but very nicely done with all the amenities the style is definitely an updated old fashioned but comfortable the gym is great and there is free wifi central location for just about everything you want to do in boston with a t stop right nearby and lots of shopping around the corner,4.0
nothing special,the great advantages are location and price its located in the heart of theater district a few steps from time square the price is fair for a well located hotel with a standard room they dont have free wireless internet i paid a fortune to use internet and print a sheet i would go back there and recomend to a friend,3.0
loved it recommended mostly,"we had a wonderful week in san francisco and really enjoyed the handlery i cant imagine a more perfect location and its really a nice place we had a club room and had hoped to get a balcony but they werent available when we got there however our room did have a giant sliding glass door that we really enjoyed we appreciated the coffee maker and little fridge toowe bought fruit at the ferry building farmers market and we kept it cooled we didnt use the robes or the shoeshine machine but they were a nice touch also they had a scale in the bathroomguess its to keep us honest with all the wonderful food in the city 
as i said there were just a couple things that keep me from giving the handlery a 5 we had a few issues with the staffall of whom were very friendly but generally not that helpful first i had done a lot of research planning our trip and emailing different hotels to see about getting a smoking room the handlery was one of the few places that indicated that it was likelyno promisesbut likely as suggested we emailed a day ahead reminding them of the request when we arrived we asked again and the clerk said nope none available it hadnt been promised but it sure didnt seem like they made any attempt either we were there a little early and id have felt better if he had at least been willing to check to see if a smoking room might be cleaned and readied lateranythingif hed just acted like he cared at all but it was just no we might well have ended up choosing the handlery anyway but a lot of the decision was made because they indicated we could probably get the smoking room and after being there im guessing that they have very few available noteon the positive side smoking was allowed at the pool area which was just a level down and very near our room so my brother didnt have to go out and huddle in the hotel doorway like so many other people we saw at many of the nonsmoking properties 
the other issue was with the internet connection we didnt go to sf to surf the net or to work but we both had a couple loose ends to take care of for work my brother travels for a living so has to connect from hotels wherever he is so he knew that the problem was not just his computer or his settings like they implied longstoryshort they ran us around for several days before a bellman finally admitted that most people had to take their laptops elsewhere and advised us that there was free wifi at nearby union square we never found out if it was a temporary problem or they just dont actually have internet available but if they had been honest from the start we could have made other arrangements once again the staff was extremely pleasant but their lack of honestly caused both a lot of frustration and a few problems 
tip for the club rooms the hotel garage entry on ofarrell is actually much handier than the hotels front door just a doorway down from there is a little print shop called cyber copy where they have internet access available the guy has a bunch of computers already set up and online so no bothering with special logins or passwords to get connected he just scribbles your time on a scrap of paper and you bring it back when youre done and you can even get pages printed if you need and hes cheap tooi think it was 8 an hour broken down every 15 mins for people who just need to check their emails occasionally its probably a better deal than paying for internet in your roomeven if you can get it to work
a note about the noise id seen complaints in this forum about noise at the handlery and many other hotels night i thought these must be sensitive folks from quiet towns or burbs not used to city sounds after being there i got it it is noisy at night a couple evenings after midnight someone started playing music on the street corner below another night a fight broke out and went on and on until the cops showed up with sirens blasting complaints about the garbage collections are legit too i thought people posting that were just nitpicking but this is one loudmother operation for us it usually started around 1am and went on for about an hour while city workers pick up trash cans left out on the sidewalkswith the perpetual safetybeepers blaring clangingbanging and noisy mechanical lifts jamming it into the trucks working their way block by block we survived i was able to tune it out reasonably easily after the first night maybe the trick was all the walking we did and climbing up  down those nearvertical streets so we were dead tired by bedtime but id advise anyone who is sound sensitive to pick up a whitenoise machine or even just run a loud fan to help tune down the decibels we were on the 3rd floor but i think it was loud enough that even the higher floors might get their share of the noise once again this isnt an issue with the handlery any more than any of the other hotels in the area its the tradeoff to be in a such a great location 
overall despite the few issues with the staff we really did enjoy staying at the handlery and our entire trip we would definitely stay there again it would be a great choice for most people unless you are a smoker and you absolutely object to stepping out to smoke or you need to use your computer in the room bottom line was that it was very clean and so comfortable after being out exploring the city all day not luxurybut it more than met our needs 
one last suggestion skip the daily grill attached to the hotel and eat at the irish bar next doorforgot the name now its not fancy at all but theyve got very good comfort food meat  potatoes and more they serve late and are very reasonably priced we give it a big thumbs up",4.0
average experience but some housekeeping issues,"i stayed here for a business trip recently and found this to be fairly typical for an embassy suites if anything set this visit apart it was the staff at the front desk and the breakfast buffet these employees went out of their way and were much appreciated

older propertynear airportcruise ships across street,i stayed at the hiotb in march for a convention on the plus side was a free airport shuttle on the minus side it is very near the airport continually heard the coming and goings of airplanes also the south tower where i stayed is right across the street from the cruise ship dock not a problem if you are coming or going on a cruise ship except for the occasional times that the ships blow their horns finally i was there during an unseasonable cold spell with strong winds the sliding glass door in the room was so decrepit that the wind blew right in all around the opening kept the room so cool i had to put the heat in the room up to 76 the property has clearly seen better days the neighborhood if you can call it that is not inviting and it is a bit of a hike to the trolley around parking lots etc that are not very friendly at night plus side the restaurantbar elephant and castle pub has a nice selection of beers and a good happy hour special imported draft beer for 425 skip buying anything in the gift shop fairly well appointed but there is a cvs drug store 3 blocks away on ash street btw why did i choose this hotel it was the only one that would honor the government per diem when i did my registration for my meeting,2.0
place to stay in the capital,"the jw marriott did not disappoint we flew into regan airport only a 1520 dollar cab ride we arrived at noon and with checkin at 400pm wondered however we got our kingsize guest room right away and what a view it was fabulous the city view was crazy staring at the momument right in the face excellent room was good all the usual with a marriot property amenities were spa like very nice beautuful lobby flower arrangements throughtout the spell of orchards was incriedable 
close to and within walking distance to all the simthsonian museums steps away from the white house if you want a tour you must arrange that from your home weeks to months in advance check out the dc website for info all the musuems are free within the institution which was great including the national zoo a must see if you are an animal lover it was great
old town trolley was a great way to see the sights if you did not have a car we actually did it twice one line took you to all the momuments the next line transfer over to the arlington cemetry and another line that takes you to the zoo and georgetown we did them all great way to see it is a hop on off trolley with free maps and fansit was hot so we needed them
we were only there for 35 days so really not enough time to see all the musems although we did get to see all the monuments and the ford theatre tour that includes the theatre and house where abraham lincoln was assassinated a must see for sure
all in all a great trip to the capital",5.0
super swanky downtown hotel,i stayed here for one night on business in nyc the hotel lobby is one of the most architecturally interesting in a very modern trendy sense places that ive seen i enjoyed the bar later at night with colleagues and a great breakfast in the morning the service at the bar was excellent but a little slow at breakfast the room was comfortable though of course small but its downtown manhattan comfy bed and a good shade to get the room very dark despite lights outside one downside to the room was some construction noise from ground zero but on the other hand it was quite amazing to sit by the window and see the ongoing construction at the site,4.0
good hotel in a great location for sightseeing,"the main plus point for us was the location of nine zero right in the middle of boston on the freedom trail and close to 2 subway stations and faneuil hall which was great for restaurants and souvenir shops
the hotel itself was fine for a few nights stay the room was a good size with a great mini bar the prices were steep though so we used the seven eleven a few doors down instead the bathroom was ok clean and the shower worked fine bed was comfortable too
the wine reception held each night at 5pm was good for a free glass of wine which we took to our room as the lounge area was full so get there early if you want to sit in the lounge
the restaurant was expensive but the food was good and had a good atmosphere but we preferred to eat out in boston anyway where it was usually half the price
our stay was fine and for the price was good value and again the location couldnt be beaten",4.0
nice hotel and helpful people,"we stayed 3 nights on a business trip the hotel was chosen when we booked our trip from our european office and we looked at the internet website first
when we arrived it was clear the impression from the website does not meet the reality at all the hotel itself is not looking this good however all people working there are very very friendly and helpful 
the food is nice and the service excellent the guys in the restaurant are really very polite and paying attention
it was still a nice experience and we will come back soon
best regards

not worth the pricewould not stay again,upon arrival could not get into front of hotelblocked off after circling block could not fit in parking garage suvs beware was not told also this parking would cost 2200 was instructed closest parking was almost a mile awayno shuttle servicecoldlateneed i say more they didnt feel our pain and made no attempt at trying to help us find a solution i guess girls are just supposed to walk alone in the middle of the nite in a strange areahmmm asked for extra towels and pillows on reservations however recieved neither no real views from anywhere in hotel furniture was old and scratched,3.0
there is no reliable airport shuttle,the hotel chooses not to operate the advertised airport shuttle at late hours substituting a cab instead the cab in my case arrived 32 minutes later than the hotel had promised and the hotel refused to reimburse a ride from any other cab the total time from landing to hotel bed was 1 hour 26 minutes,1.0
cheap but sort of crappy,having stayed at a nicer budgey hotel in nyc recently hotel 17 off of union square the grant hotel was a complete letdown the bathroom was sort of gross and dirty the whole time i was there the room was dingy and the hotel staff messed up my reservations and gave me the key to a room where someone was asleep in bed yikes not pleasant at all also they said they had cable but they totally didnt,2.0
beautiful hotel with great location,i love this hotel just a few hundred feet from union square and the service is impeccable beautiful rooms,4.0

the best hotel ever,"i stayed at this holiday inn express  suites this past weekend with my two small children i strongly recommend this property to anyone wishing to stay in the polaris area we were in town visiting family and paying a visit to the awesome columbus zoo upon arrival i was greeted and checked in by a very friendly desk clerk she was very pleasant and friendly the hotel is immaculate i honestly couldnt find one thing out of place or a speck of dirtor hairanywhere just a beautiful new hotel the pool area is fantastic for the kids i loved how it was open until 11pm nice chairs and tables and ample fresh towels in the pool our room was nice and large the bathroom was roomy with good water pressure and a massaging shower head clean clean cleanprobably the cleanest hotel bathroom that i have ever come across i cannot say enough good things about this hotel the beds were really comfortable we went down the next morning for breakfast and this is where my one and only complaint comes from no fresh fruit available i asked the clerk and was told that they were all out and expecting a shipment on monday this was saturday and i would think that someone would run on down to the grocery store and purchase some fresh fruit for the guests on the weekend other than that the breakfast area was nice roomy clean and the worker there was friendly and accomodating otherwise
all around a great stay we will return and definately would recommend to anyone",5.0
plaza fifty was nice and clean,we stayed at the plaza fifty in july 2003 the hotel staff was very nice and let us check in 3 hours early the room was very clean and a nice size there was a microwave coffee pot and fridge in the room i would definitely stay here again,5.0
perfect location and very clean,"just got back from a one night stay at the austin hyatt oct 2006 there were four us all together we shared one room 1120 with 2 double beds 
this hotel is in the perfect location just off i35 on the south side of downtown austin it is a mile from the downtown location of shady grove and chuys and you can walk across the bridge to get to the downtown clubs and restaurants beats trying to find parking in downtown there is free self parking on the property very close to the main entrance to the hotel
the hotel itself has the same bones but it has been renovated with an updated decor our room was very nice spacious and clean we requested more towels on our way out and they were waiting for us on our return 
the only odd thing with the renovation is that they seemed to have kept the same old bathroom shower tiles and the same old door and handle thats is the only thing that i could find with the room 
the rooms were very quiet and the beds comfortable 
you will enjoy your stay at the austin hyatt and get a good nights sleep as well",5.0
beautiful lobby shame about the rooms,rooms were very small and not well kept furniture was very old and tatty needed updating bathroom was very small and badly designed staff were friendly and helpful although seemed to be a bit pushy on sales lobby is beautiful didnt hear any noise from other rooms we had a broken iron and board and called reception for a new one took them 30 minutes and another call to chase them up about it,3.0
pleasantly surprised,ive never stayed at a la quinta property before but you can guarantee i will go back again we booked two rooms as we were traveling with my parents teenage children and our faithful dog in tow the rooms were spacious clean and more than adequate breakfast in the morning was a nice touch and a great savings for us it was a bit of a pain that pet owners had to stay on the fifth floortraveling up on an elevator with our dog was an adventure in itself for us and others but the elevators were fast and always readily available internet connections in the rooms were reliable and speedy the hotel location is great within walking distance of an outdoor mall and jasons deli we did get some noisy neighbors at midnighta young family with loud voices and a young and very unhappy child after about an hour of listening to their every movement and word i called the front desk they responded right away with a phone call to the room didnt help too much but we were able to turn the ac fan on constant to at least drown out some of the noise,4.0
charming and plush and wonderful location,"i booked last minute at the talbott while in chicago and was very happy with my stay and services the staff was friendly and helpful especially the concierge with directions and recommendations i stayed in a double queenbed room which was huge by traditional hotel room standards the carpet was plush the bed comfortable and the other amenities quite thoughtful such as umbrellas in the room just in case aveda bath products were also a nice touch 
one caution there is a large construction site next to the hotel so rooms facing that side will be noisy after 800 am most mornings the front desk staff was accommodating though and offered to move me if the noise was too much
i would highly recommend this hotel and definitely would stay there again",5.0
comfortable hotel perfectly situated for the sights of new york,the hilton new york is a large well run hotel perfectly situated for the sites of new york the hotel has everything you need for a pleasant stay including a fitness area  restaurants and two bars the hotel has recently been refurbished and the rooms are very tastefully decorated with modern facilities such as a walkin shower and a large flat screen tv it is a very comfortable hotel perfectly situated for the sights of new york the only criticism is that because the hotel is very large it can feel a little inpersonnel but the staff are very attentive and helpful we were there celebrating our daughters 18th birthday and my wifes early retirement and they were presented with a gift of chocolate strawberrys which was a very nice personnel touch we really enjoyed our stay in new york,4.0

non smoking  cool corner room  requested a high floor

1 check  in 
flight delayed resulting in a late arrival at the hotel 130am
hotel advises they are sold out of rooms on high floors but assure us one will be available the following night
we get to our room and find it is a smoking wonderful room
we contact the front desk and they tell us they are sold out 
slightly problematic when you have prepaid for a room that is double the price of the accomodations you are being placed in
the mgr on duty got involved and said there was nothing on our reservation associated with a cool corner room just their basic room
we had to produce our confirmation email and proof of payment
upon review they took care of the situation and promised an upgrade the following night
the following night we were moved to a high floor cool corner room however that is what we had paid forso there was no upgrade involved we were just moved to the room we reserved
 the cool corner rooms  high floors are a must

very nice property,this is a really nice hotel my husband and i came to austin for an overnight stress relief and this hotel made it easy the front desk was very friendly we asked them to call us a cab and they were very accommodating we had drinks at the bar before we left and the bartender was also very friendly we requested specific pillows which we did receive we did not eat any meals here so i cant comment on the food it was extremely clean neat and well maintained we will definitely come back to this location the next time we need a quick getaway could not be happier,5.0
only the front desk is worth a positive mention,"this property desparately needs a redo the room was just 1 degree above acceptable tired wornoutrather ranksmellingthe smoke from the other rooms on my floor was almost as bad as having a smoking roomi realize that this is for people having extended stays and that itself creates specific challenges i was only booked for 3 nightsi asked for the limited maid service just to freshen the room up a bit  a reasonable 500 chargesince i was out a full day looking forward to the bed at least being made when i returnedthe room wasnt touched in my absence i was told the 500 would be refunded i have yet to see it on my statement
it isnt the money its the incompetence of handling such a simple request arranging maid service and not following through the only reason i could possibly recommend this property is that the location is very good the front staff was friendly  that is the only positive thing i can say the elevator was old creaky and a joke overall graffitti was on the advertisements on the elevator walls i am sure itthe elevator gets a large amount of use because of the inout nature of the property and the amount of luggage sacksboxes etc that guests haul in and out so i would recommend a 1st floor roomunless you really need an extended stay i would avoid this property altogether",1.0
fantastic hotel and amazing staff,"this is by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in from the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic and so helpful when i originally booked the hotel i mentioned that it was my friends birthday and after we checked in and went to our room we were greeted with a birthday cake which was such a lovely surprise and unexpected the staff were very polite and always had a smile on their face the whole stay was faultless
we opted for a suite which was spotlessly clean and the bed was extremely comfy my only suggestion would be to ask for a room with a view because our room had an internal view of the hotel which wasnt a problem but a view of the city would have been amazing the amenities inside the room were second to none the tv was superb room service was so easy to use and the food was absoultely brilliant as good as any restaurant its not cheap but if you fancy staying in and eating good food then its the perfect option
also the hotel was very quiet and peaceful location wise youre perfectly situated near to central park and 5th avenue for all your shopping requirements perfect
yes the hotel is expensive but you pay for luxury and the standard is definitely 1010 if you visit nyc and want a bit of opulence then this is without question the hotel for you 
overall an amazing experience
thank you",5.0
wonderful hotel excellent location,we stayed at the millennium bostonian over the 4th of july i can honestly say that there is no better place to be during this holiday there is so much to see and do in boston over the 4th the location of the hotel is amazing you are directly across the street from the quincy market and the state house is right around the corner there are so many sites in walking distance that i could not begin to mention all of them the hotel rooms were spacious very clean and comfortable it was very peaceful inside we stayed in a fireplace suite that had a balcony that over looked a courtyard and quincy market the exterior of the hotel was very european with beautiful flower boxes the staff was efficient and very helpful the food at the resturant was delicious and well portioned and fairly priced there was nothing about this hotel that i did not like we cant wait to go back i would recommend this hotel to anyone,5.0
excellent value in a great area of manhattan,"i was very impressed with the hilton garden inn in tribeca the rooms were very clean updated and nice with a refridgerator and microwave pretty lobby free cookies in the evening and coffee in the am close walk to little italychinatown and greenwich village and right on the a c e subway line for those that dont want to walk this line takes you right to times square if you are heading that way 
i was amazed that the price was right around 200 for a nice hotel in a good location staff was very friendly and helpful the restaurant that is attached is also worth visitingand the italian place across the street is very good too 
free wifi was great 
only suggestion would be a safe in the room",5.0
boring no frills business hotel,"this hotel has a few positives
 immediate proximity to the washington convention center but not that close to main tourist attractions though with the exception of chinatown which is located a couple of blocks away
 a great and stylish lobby with various lounge areas and a nice area equipped with several sofas and bookshelves despite the presence of a starbucks and a junk food store those unfortunately make the whole thing look a bit like a lowkey shopping mall
 comfortable beds and pillows
 a welcoming staff
besides the bed the rooms are however more than disappointing very basic and standard a carbon copy of any marriott courtyard room  standard furniture with no particular style noisy and ineffective air conditioning very basic and slightly run down bathroom very old fashioned tiles no separate shower  a simple showerhead in the bathroom and a curtain no courtesy water bottles no minibar or espresso machine in the room no slippers no bathrobe no ipod docking station no central control of lights etc my usual complaints about so many hotel rooms in the us my room was a reasonable size but one may wonder about the presence of two queen or king beds per room which could make sense in a family hotel but really not in a business hotel only one bed but a sofa a table and a couple of armchairs would have been a much more effective use of the available space 
finally they charge an outrageous 1295 usd per day for wifi access this is really over the top considering the already excessive prices this hotel charges for the rooms
service at the hotels restaurant was courteous but exceptionally slow",3.0
greaat location,"service from the front desk was great zack is very personable and helpful all in all the
hotel was very good except for the carpets they all need to be replaced could also use
a larager room for breakfast although the food was plentiful and good i would definitely
stay there again the loaction is great",4.0
a great value city hotel,"this is a great city hotel clean well positioned good value and efficient used it for a couple of days whilst in boston it is well located and within a short walk to all the city centre landmarks car parking is 25 a day in a nearby car park which you pay through the hotel room had everything we needed and was typical city hotel size compact shower room was very well provisioned and the whole package was well looked after on the cleanliness side the restaurant was closed during my stay which was puzzling but a nearby bar provided great meals and the centre haunts were close
a good buy in boston",5.0
there are better hotels for this price,"after checking in at bay landing159tax on our first night in sf and at westin market street169tax on the second night our hotel expectations were pretty high so we were disappointed when we checked in at comfort inn  which actually cost more than the first two hotels at 189taxes i booked these hotels online so i figured the location must be the reason for the high rate but westin has a better neighborhood than this and a few minutes walk to embarcadero
here are other gripes
1 one of the front desk clerk was curt and unfriendly when we were asking if we could deposit our bags early enough to make me want to cancel my reservation unfortunately i would have forfeited the fee for the first night so we just let it go fyi at bay landing they let us leave our bulky luggage in their storage room while we explored the city
2 price for the room is not worth it even with the free breakfast and free wifi definitely not worth the 200 total i paid online  i have yet to see if the safety deposit box fee is true when i check out later
3 smell of the room is what greets you when you first come it smells of old cabs with damp carpets they need to recarpet the room and change the ac its 5am now as i write this and i cant sleep because of this smell  cant wait to check out of here
will not stay here again",3.0
wonderful monaco,"i stayed at the monaco for two separate nights on each side of a trip to moms in colorado springs the first night the really nice front desk guy upgraded me to a suite the room service dinner was just perfect 
staff was very accommodating and helpful
and the tattered cover bookstore is just down the street",5.0
road trip 4th hotel in 8 days,"we decided to stay here due to the brand and obviously the rate that we got
pool was good a resort type feel and staff helpful
additional charges for the car parking was acceptable as it is an airport hotel
my only gripe was one had to pay for wifi in your room as recently mentioned by mphbrown however it was free in the foyer where there were obviously nonresidents there also taking quite a lot of the avaliable seating the previous hotels in san francisco monterey etc an independent one too all provided free wifi in the rooms which is now an essential in most hotels 
so my review was have a recommendation to the hotel would be move with the times so will not be visiting there again unless the rate is cheap enough to negate the wifi costs
also they were the only hotel out of all of them not to have coffee making facilities forcing one to visit the starbucks in the foyer",3.0
recently redone but still needs redoing,we stayed here overnight while visiting family in dc i got a very good rate on priceline because the hotel is currently in renovations the hotel desk made it very clear that renovations were going on but that we would be on a finished floor the room we stayed in looked finished but there were still some things that were not done the fixtures in the bathroom were cheaply done and the caps on the shower had pulled away from their seals where you would expect marble there was bamboo its cute on the surface but very tinny feeling the beds are comfortable but so high off the ground that for someone short like me its actually a little difficult to get on and off for what we paid i didnt mind too much but id never pay the rack rate for this place,3.0
marriott century city,"here are a few of my observations from my recent stay
1 valet was awesome they were expedient and professional
2 no concierge floor no concierge floor in beverly hillsi dont get it
3 air conditioner in room was horrible it was a hot day in la and the room would not cool down
4 800 breakfast sandwhich are you kidding me i have stayed at a lot of marriotts being a gold member and i can tell you that i have never felt gauged at a marriott until i stayed here 4000 for a couple to eat at this marriott breakfast sandwhichs and drinks for my wife and i totaled just short of 40 unbeliveable
5 no plug next to the bed to charge phone most marriotts have a plug that is part of the lamp next to the bed this facility has no plugs next to the bed
it is because of the aforementioned items that i will not b staying at this marriott ever again i will find another marriott in the nearby area that has these amenities i know they exist because almost every marriott in which i have stayed has been able to provide the items that i mentioned above

perfect for a short business stay,"i stayed here for 3 nights on business as my usual hotel was fullcolleagues had recommended the sierra so i decided to try itfriendly welcome and complimentary cookies on arrival
the rooms were reasonably spacious with fridge and microwave  a colleague had a mini suite with a kitchenette my room was clean no view to speak of back of the car park but perfect for crashing after a day in the office the bed was comfortable and the hotel was surprisingly quiet apart from jet lag i slept well and the breakfast buffet was great with a good selection including an omelette station my only gripe was that the air con unit was a bit noisy
we had bar snacks one evening pizza nachos etc  all reasonably priced quick servicethe bar is a bit clinicallacking in atmosphere but was fine
the location is near to a target and a number of cheap dining options but not much else  this was fine for us but if you want nearby entertainment stay in santana row there is also a free shuttle 5 mile radius but make sure you book ahead free wifi
when i am here on business again and my usual is full then i would definitely stay here again  its perfect when you have a busy schedule and just need a quiet pleasant place to crash that is reasonably priced staff were friendly and efficient",4.0
only perfect,to put it simply this is an extraordinary hotel but not merely because of the standard concerns of location and amenities it has those in abundance but it has something else that truly sets it above and apart from even what most would otherwise consider the best the management and staff of the iroquois new york genuinely care about the pleasure you take from your stay with them no it is not overt or even subtly obsequious treatment that lacks sincerity and substances it is exclusively about how you the guest perceives the physical characteristics of the hotel the merits of its collective efforts and the overall attitude and manner the entire package is delivered they could not do it better moreover no hotel my wife and i have ever stayed in fortytwo plus years of traveling in asia europe canada the caribbean and the united states has come even close,5.0
good service but errors in handling room,hotel staff was great but i didnt appreciate having my room given to another and ending up with a smoking room first come first serve is my slogan and that doesnt mean arrival time but booking time aside from that the staff offered to change the following day but not good enough,3.0
great place to stay,everything was excellent the staff was outstanding we will stay there again,5.0
drake hotel chicago great value great service and good food,thouroughly enjoyed my stay at the drake hotel in chicago this hotel has loads of history 85 years of it famous hotel guests from movie stars to princess dianaso cool staff at checkin counter were very helpful with my extra requests this hotel has wellsized nicely appointed clean rooms my room had a view of the lake and a nearby gazebo nice plus drake bros restaurant in the morning for very pleasant breakfast with friendly fast service and good food short walk to shopping is a big plus too ill be back to this hotel,5.0
great view from our room but a few blocks from everything,"nice room warm welcome nice bed huge bathroom and shower area clean great view of millenium park down to buckingham fountain shedd aquarium etc south facing not overly spectacular good room service one night at about 11pm because no restaurants in the area were serving food that late we were in chicago for my partners birthday and i told the attendant on the phone who sent up a piece of cake with our room service very nice gesture
the hotel is a few blocks from michigan ave and the river although it felt like a miles away from any happening area seemed more business than tourist although if it wasnt as warm out as it was it would have been easily walkable to most places
next trip will stay at n michigan ave although not because the hotel is lacking in anything in particular but rather location location location",4.0
business like and efficient,"nothing to complain about here rooms are nice and clean the service is efficient central to everything we want to do in san francisco 
i would certainly come back",4.0
great hotel  location cant be beat,my wife and i stayed here on the last night of our delta blues pilgrimage with my hilton honors card they upgraded us to an executive king suite that had a wrap around balcony the room and amenities were all top notch and the location was perfect for exploring beale street a half block away in fact the location here is actually more convenient than the peabody which is another block away from our balcony we could listen to the great band playing in handy park and enjoy the sights of downtown memphis including peabody place for the price this hotel cant be beat as an aside if youre looking for great ribs hit the blues city cafe on beale street they were incredible also for some real delta blues check out dr feelgood potts he was playing at the blues hall in the rum boogie cafe a great harp player and showman,5.0
terrible location  a warning,the hotel and service are your average middle of the road hotel adequate breakfast included bagels fruit yogurt juice and coffee if you want anything else be prepared to bring a swiss bank account the staff is friendly enough the pool was closed even though it was in the 80s during our stay which was disappointing very important know that you will not have a good nights sleep here it is incredibly noisy as this hotel is directly next to a major highway onramp and every motorcycle in town loves to drive as fast as possible on that ramp also if youre in town on a wednesday do not stay here there is a motorcycle competition in the parking lot that goes on until very late at night  not the hotels fault but irritating after driving all day nonetheless we tried to opt for the air conditioners obnoxiousmotor sound to drown out the sound but that didnt even help be forewarned there are better options in the area choose carefully,3.0
as expected,the reviews i read about parc 55 regarding its convenient location the cleanliness of the room and the warm welcome came out true as expected the little nice details included how the housekeeping people kept even the tiniest clutter shoes toiletries pens in place there was a construction going on at the side of the hotel which made noise during the night but it is something that is temporary other than that we enjoyed our stay at the hotel because of its convenient location and reasonable rates and pampered by housekeeping department we stayed at the 21st floor for 5 days,5.0

beautiful resort wonderful pools fantastic bellman,"we just returned from a 4 night stay when we arrived rather late on saturday night june 11 we asked if we could have a room with a view we were told there were only two rooms left and they had parking lot views upon arriving in our room it reeked of sewage our bellman noticed the smell and offered to have the maids come and spray they arrived promptly but we knew spraying the room would not eliminate the odor we contacted the front desk and were told the only other available room had wet carpet we were tired from our trip from the east coast and asked the front desk to find us another hotel then after much discussing among themselves they found another room our very kind bellman dick then drove us up the cliffs and carried our bags again in the heat to a suite with a beautiful view hilton certainly has a fantastic employee in dick he knew we were ready to leave the tapatio cliffs and find something else but he was so kind pointing out all the good features of the hotel we were so happy with our suite with the view all our bad thoughts about the resort quickly disappeared dick then called us when he got back down to the front desk to assure us that we could have the suite for our 4 nights and not have to move to less expensive room the next day 
 when we return to phoenix we will definitely want to stay at the cliffs and will probably pay the extra money for the view it was so wonderful to sit on the patio and drink coffee early in the morning and enjoy that view
thanks to dick for sticking with us and seeing we were happy with our room hilton is very fortunate to have an employee who represented them very well unlike the front staff",4.0
clean rooms great service,my wife and i stayed from june 69 we could not have asked for the rooms to be any cleaner nor the staff any friendlier the location is ideal a subway station is nearby and you are halfway between the attractions and sights of midtown and lower manhatten my only complaint is that the breakfast was not free for the price it should be included that is the only reason i did not give it an excellent rating,4.0
the warwick  seen better days,the room was tiny and dark lamp light was necessary in the daytime as my rooms window looked out onto a dingy air shaft the furniture was significantly chipped scarred and mismatched the mattress hard i wish i had taken pictures of this room i concur with the reviewer who mentioned allergies i found my eyes itching and watering etc due to something in the air i had returned to new york to take a college comprehensive exam for my masters degree booking the warwick via expedia i was excited to stay at this historical and elegant as pictured on the website hotel for what i paid 260 per night it was definitely a let down i asked for a room change at the front desk but was told i had paid for the deluxe and would need to pay more to upgrade to a nonair shaft view im sure such an illustrious hotel would have higher quality accommodations cary grant lived there for goodness sake but either they have quite a disparity in room offerings and thus prices andor the management has changed and it is not what it used to be i felt as though the hotel cared less about my satisfaction that is not the way to impress clientel in my humble opinion i could deal with all this for just two nights since i wanted to study for my exam but most memorable and disheartening was the rudeness of the staff according to the hotel description a coffee pot was included in the room rate and would be there upon arrival as it was not i requested one the man who delivered it practically threw it at me on top of that upon checkout i was charged a per day extra surcharge fee it wasnt a lot but i felt cheated even further i will give the warwick credit for being in a good though not spectacular location unless you can afford to spend buckets of money on a hotel i would not recommend the warwick because you just dont know what youll get,1.0
right smack bang in the middle of manhattan,"well this is the third time i have been to the metro 45 west 35th street new york it is not a big flash hotel it is not fabulous but the biggest attribute is where it is positioned right opposite macys where you could spend all day
this time we had a family suite 2 bedrooms with two double beds in one and 1 double bed in the other it had one shower room with toilet and sink but another sink outside the shower room as it is always girls on shopping trips these rooms are fine warm and everything needed and lots of room to store your wares the room was 450 a night without taxesetc but it worked out around 34000 each 3 girls for 4 nights which is around 8500 a night each 25500 for the room each night but this includes breakfast which includes coffee tea cereal cheeses fresh fruit muffins bagels cakes etc coffee is also available all day until late night instead of bringing one in you just need to help yourself and take it to your room or have it in the lounge
when you come out of the hotel turn right and you are at macys herald square turn left and you are in fifth avenue 1 block down is the empire state building
food  at the end of the street on the way to macys is a pizza place with the most gorgeous pizza slices i have tasted for about 279 starting from lord  taylor department store is in fifth avenue and they have a super cafe on the 6th floor fabby they sell ice cream cake a different flavour every day we had lunch here twice afternoon tea at lady mendls tea salon was fabulous youll see this on the web site its in greenwich village 5 courses salad with vinegareitte sandwichs scones cake and strawberries dipped in chocolate cookies etc 45 each includes taxes and tip irvine place

another lovely weekend at the greenwich,this is the second time we have stayed at the greenwich and we really enjoy staying here the rooms are lovely and large and the decoration is great they have a beautiful courtyard where you can have a drink on a warm day and their restaurant is very good we have stayed in new york many times but would rather stay here than anywhere else as it feels small and homely last time we stayed we moved from a hotel uptown and requested a room with a tub the front desk didnt tell us that they couldnt accommodate this until we got there which was fairly annoying as it was only 24hrs in advance so i cant believe they didnt know what room would be available anyway still a great hotel and i plan to book way in advance next time i go to nyc to get one of the larger rooms with the deep soaking tubs divine,5.0
customer service,i called the front desk because i was having internet issues i was transferred to security the young man i spoke with was named flaveo he was very rude and irritated with my questions i informed him that i was having issues with getting into the hotels system i had never had this issue at any other hotel an i didnt understand why wifi service cost when its normally free he stated thats just the way it is either you want it or you don sir if you want it pay for it or ill get you to technical support it was his attitude not what he said that upset me when i told him i tried the technical support number and wasnt able to get help he hung up on me i was already upset at the quality of the room i was considering changing hotels i went to dinner and once i returned i called back i was transferred by the front desk again i explained the issue i had to teana and requested her assistance she insured me that the hotel staff are professional and that behavior was unacceptable and would be reviewed she told me the staff no longer come up to assist with internet help however she would come up immediately and see if she could assist me through the process when she arrived she was able to walk me through the process and help me access my companies server had i spoke to her first i may have rated the hotel at least a four,3.0
perfect for us,this is a first class hotel with extremely courteous staff the price for this quality could not be beat and believe me i checked the location is excellent just a few blocks from the mall whitehouse and metro station we arrived late and called to have the feather pillows changed out my wife is allergic and even at the late hour they responded within a minute this is a common call for us but i have not experienced more prompt or courteous service,5.0
1st trip to california in 2008,a few yrs late in posting this review the when did you travel option wont let you go back further than november 2011 but i went in july 2008 this was a good hotel literally across the street from tourist sights and bus tours and right on the walk of fame i am planning on visiting ca again in another year or so and i may try the renaissance instead just to be able to have something to rate the roosevelt against but to me the roosevelt seemed more of a party type hotel we stayed for 5 nights and twice the front entrance was closed to guests due to an affair being given in the pool area but the room was lovely the view very nice and the elevatorroom key cardexcellent idea you cant go anywhere on the elevator unless you use your key card and you can only go to your room floor so no one can come off the street and go upstairs unless they are guests all the staff was first rate and id stay again especially for the great locale,4.0
good value for nyc,"great location rooms are adequate would prefer a coffeemaker instead of scale
service reasonably friendly few problems with plumbing promptly corrected
concierge desk was helpful with restaurant locations reservations directions etc
if budgetconscious do not use concierge desk for broadway show tickets call ticketmaster and save half what the brokers are charging or visit box office of
show you would like to see also check hotel website for room rates they were
greatly discounted from what was showing on ta i absolutely chose this hotel
because of ta reviews as alwaysdont leave home without them",4.0
wonderful boutique hotel in downtown denver,this hotel is wonderful the staff has always been friendly and very knowledgable about the area their recomendations are usually right on the only drawback i see is the breakfast its edible but not great the happy hour and the cookies are wonderful the location is perfect for any activities within the downtown area and the rooms are spacious and comfortable we stay here anytime were in denver,5.0
a pleasant stay,we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights over spring break although it is a little out of town it is easily accessed off the i40 and is located near a large number of shops wolfchase mall restaurants and a theater complex good rooms and indoor pool fairly limited breakfast overall a pleasant stay in a nice hotel,4.0
great place but please get new carpet,"i booked this place on hotwire so it was seriously cheap but when i saw that it was recently refurbished i was happy with what id been given
the staff were friendly end efficient on arrival and the room was fashionable and comfortable though no desk for a computer just a small table
i tried the bar on the first night and was impressed by the mixologists expertise great manhattans  i wouldnt have been happy with the room directly above though noise was sometime a problem from people shouting at each other on the stairs though i cant say this ruined the stay and street noise was almost non existent
the free breakfast was decent and an unexpected surprise
the one thing that lets the place down after whats clearly an expensive refurb is that the carpets havent been changed and the allison carpets are well past their sell by date if the crescent wants to properly live up to its new image then it needs to get the carpets redone throughout",4.0
terrible worst resort i have ever stayed at,"my friend and i recently stayed at the town and country resort for 5 nights and wished we were somewhere else most of the time we were there the front desk staff were not very welcoming and although we arrived early we were told our rooms would be ready by 330pm we checked back with front desk staff at 430 and only one of two rooms were ready it was 545 pm before the second room was ready the front desk staff did not apologize for the inconvenience at all
the rooms were not what we had registered for nor confirmed we registered for rooms with king beds and both of us actually ended up with rooms that had two double beds
both rooms had 1 inch gaps between the bottom of the door and the flooring which would have allowed insects and small critters to enter the room as a result we both stuffed towels and pillows under our doors each night to avoid such scenarios one room did not have a hair dryer available and when one was requested it took nearly 55 minutes before it was delivered when my friend attempted to use the hairdryer there were sparks coming from the plug of it
the bathtub in one room was not clean  there were rings of soap remaining from shampoo bottles utilized by previous occupants the kleenex box was empty and was not refilled for two day and the décor was extremely dated  like 1980s 
there were no desks in the rooms for working and as a resort that is accustomed to hosting business conferences the rooms should all have proper desks and appropriate chairs conducive to business the small round table and chairs are absolutely not conducive to effective working conditions for business personnel there were no extra blankets available in the room which is especially critical since neither the heating nor air conditioning units were in working order the water bottles in both rooms were not replenished after being consumed by occupants 2 and 3 days prior there was no refrigerator or mini barsnack bar available in rooms which is absolutely standard at every other resort i have stayed at a proper resort would never offer a combo shampooconditioner product but rather would offer spa quality personal products as a result my collegue and i went out and purchased shampoo and condictioner for use during our stay
one of our rooms was located next to a housekeeping room and staff was extremely loud and disruptive beginning as early as 530am so rude and inconsiderate numerous carts were being pushed around at all hours of the day and night by staff and was extremely disruptive many conference attendees had the same complaint
the security was inadequate to assure the safety of hotel guests while this is a large complex the resort could and should implement some basic safety precautions such as having security personnel on duty and walking the premises installing entrances that require use of card keys to enter hotel areas anyone could walk onto this property at any time without being stopped by personnel or card key access points 
the food and service quality at each of the hotel restaurants was substandard the staff no more than handed us our menus and they proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order when we requested another minute or two they walked away and did not check back with us for nearly 10 minutes despite our attempts to get their attention they continued to talk with other restaurant staff and were oblivious to our attempts to wave them overget their attention once we got our food we repeatedly waited in excess of 1520 minutes before our wait staff checked in and gave us our bill
there was a fitness center on the property but we were told that cost extra that is ridiculous to charge extra for fitness centerespecially at a resort
to top this all off when we went down to check out we werent even asked how our stay was which i guess is not surprising bc im sure they are tired of hearing from guests how bad it is they also didnt even offer to help us out to a cab with our big bags and is not easy to get out the door of that lobby appalling
this entire property is in dire need of updating and a general maintenance overhaul
i would never return to this resort and will not recommend this facility to any friends or colleagues nor for any future conferences i hope they take this feedback seriously",1.0
terrific rooms and wonderful service,"i stayed 2 nights at the sofitel for a meeting and was very impressed by the attentive service and stylish surroundings unlike many other hotels checkin was a breeze and not chaotic the hotel is right around the corner from the white house and very convenient to all monuments with a blueorange metro station on the next blockperfect for transit to dca as well as all of the city
my kingbedroom was spacious luxurious and quietperfect for those on business while i did not take advantage of the huge and deep tub the separate shower was a welcome relief after a long hot day the bed was very comfortableand the blackout drapes made it difficult to wake up in the morning the fitness room with bikes treadmills elliptical machines free weights and various weighttraining machines was very well kept and maintained unfortunately it is in the basement like many luxury hotels internet is not included
allinall a great place to stay",4.0
charming hotel,we are very impressed with the normandy the rooms are small but full of fun details the lobby and reception areas are beautiful and the hotel has small touches like complimentary wine and cheese with conversationstarter cards at each table the location is great and they even have free wifi highly recommended,5.0
reasonable,this place was ok suited what we needed  a cheaper place to stay in west la some staff were helpful  some staff were far from helpful the asian lady who worked at the front desk was not helpful we had the upgraded larger room close to restaurants and a 711 just down the road our friends parked their car here with no issues it seems like a bit of a dodgey area but generally it seems quiet safe,3.0
gem in the city,i wasnt sure i could find a good notso pricey hotel in midtown during spring break but i did rooms are small but neat breakfast is plentiful and the location is fantastic two blocks from penn station easy walking to times square theaters central parknow i have a hotel to go to when i visit new york again,4.0
everything that you would need in a downtown hotel,i stayed at this hotel because of the good reviews that it has received i was in a wedding at another downtown hotel but the gaslamp plaza suites was half the price it is in a very convenient location to the trolley airport bus and all the barsrestaurants in the quarter i was a bit surprised by how much the area reminded me of bourbon street especially on saturday night so be advised that there are lots of young drunk people milling about at night there the hotel itself was perfect for what i needed my room was kind of an odd lay out without much natural light but i wasnt there much during the day so it didnt matter too much i probably would have given the place 5 stars if id had a brighter more open room but i cant really complain given the price everything was new and super clean which makes me very happy they have nice touches like a full set of dishes refrigerator microwave dvd player all that makes it very comfortable a free breakfast on their nice roof top is also a big plus simple continental style  cereals toast muffins coffee juice fruitbut still nice to have the staff was very friendly and helpful,4.0
very far from downtown la,this is not a hotel its more like a motel located off a busy highway the kind of place where people stay for one night the rooms were reasonably comfortable with tv etc but very dated decor and no room cleaning,2.0
the bed was so comfy it was hard to get up,what a fantastic hotel so modern and trendy the room was a fine size especially as we didnt spend to much time in it great location right near the empire state building staff were friendly enough but the hired staff for the concierge desk especially duane were excellent and helped us with all of our excursions would definately use this hotel when returning to nyc we even took a picture of the mattress as it was so comfortable we want one for our bed back home in england definately recommended,4.0
what happened to breakfast,this is a wonderful hotel they used to provide breakfast but not this trip staff is great location is very good room was small but this is nyc but what mba suggest they stop providing breakfast it is about the customer after all,4.0
a life saver,the service was prompt and excellent the room was not only spotlessly clean but also laid out in a way that makes sense modern spacious and comfy with a big screen tv actual ceramic cups sealed with the coffee maker downstairs is what they call the cafe basically the other side of the checkin counter where they offer food and drink 24 hours a day the menu consists of soups salads sandwiches and its all made to order to eat right there or take up to the room we had tomato soup and turkey sandwich it was fresh and delicious i also saw cooked breakfast items on the menu i like the convenience of having this type of food option much less hassle than having to go to a proper restaurant especially when arriving late at night i highly recommend this hotel,5.0
cool and friendly hotel,"we stayed 1 night here as part of a mini tour of the east coast the hotel has a certain charm to it with stylish decor and a neat boutique feel the room was a lot smaller than i was expecting however a small amount of legspace around a large double bed was pretty much it with a small bathroom attached we stayed in the cheapest room and spied one of the deluxe rooms that looked much more spacious so probably with a bigger budget you can expect a little more legroom at the end of the day the room was plenty for what we needed but perhaps a longer stay would have lead to some claustrophobia
locationwise the hotel is about a 10min cab ride from the train station its also in easy walking distance from the many restaurants on south street and the fabulous reading terminal market which i could have spent a week in sampling all the foods the bigger sights are maybe a little further than advertised  either that or were slow walkers  but it was maybe 1520 mins to the liberty bell  old town and 30 mins or so to the rocky steps wed already done a gazillion miles of walking this trip so our feet may have been tireder than usual
what most impressed us was the friendliness of the staff here giving us a street map complete with circled points of interest and some personal recommendations as well as the list of good restaurants to choose from these sorts of touches make a stay in a new city so much easier
breakfast was varied and plentiful and a checkout of 12 noon meant we got to spend the morning sightseeing without messing with bags i can see why this place comes so highly recommended by tripadvisor",4.0
if location is key to you then stay here,this was our second stay at the catamarn and we returned for the location and the beautiful grounds both times we had bay front suites the views are great and there is nothing more relaxing then sitting on a balcony watching the water the ocean beach is a short oneblock walk away and most of the other major san diego attractions are a quick drive the pool is where we ended up spending most of our time this trip sipping on margaritas and pina coladas from room service very nice the tropical foliage surrounding the pool and the entire property is beautiful and the pool was clean and warm my two girls ages 1 and 2 didnt want to get out restaurant has great food but service was lacking a bit while the rooms are clean the furnishings desperately need to be updated the polynesian theme is fine but everything is so dark and starting to show its age the beds are horrible unless you like your mattress to feel like a piece of plywood we had a problem with our air conditioning but it was fixed immediately overall the catamaran is a good place to stay and is on the cusp of being great just update those rooms and get some better mattresses pronto,4.0
the roosevelt is a great deal,because of work in new york we stay in the city about a month out of each year we have stayed in many hotels in midtown as a result the roosevelt was a nice find very close to grand central station and within easy walking distance to the theaters the mid town business district and times square the lobby is among the best in the city and the restoration work is near perfect without looking plastic,4.0
premiere location to shopping and business,a lovely hotel in the middle of everywhere  my husband conducted business and i shopped the staff and service are friendly and very accommodating,4.0
great place to stay,close to airport shuttle runs every half hour great customer service restaurant onsite much better than expected,5.0
nice clean hotel near freeways,this hotel was fine for business travel the rooms are a little dated but comfortable,3.0
good location,"we stayed here for a couple of nights in october the location is excellent  right behind the hollywood  highland shopping centre walking distance to the walk of fame chinese theatre etc the hotel is quite old and there is poor soundproofing on the rooms our room was 106 which is right next to the lobby and we could hear everything that was going on out there they could easily improve this by sealing up the gaps around the door to the room the room itself was comfortable enough and included a small kitchenette which was handy the bathroom is a little dated but was still ok parking is very tight but we didnt have any problems and i believe they have another parking lot elsewhere if the main lot holds about 12 cars is full
breakfast is available in the lobby and consists of juiceteacoffee and some dry croissants  muffins it is barely edible but i guess it is better than nothing some fresh fruit would be a huge improvement there is a pc in the lobby for internet access too
overall it was good value considering the great location as you can pay much more for accommodation in this area we found it to be fine for a couple of nights stay",4.0
dont stay on the 1st or 2nd floor if you want to sleep before 2am,i get the whole trendy loft idea it is sort of cool but the reality is this hotel has smaller rooms and less amenities than other hotels and its expensive beware the music is so loud in the lobby area that is you are on the 1st or 2nd floor you can not even think of sleeping before 2am when the bar closes i switched rooms the next night and had a better nights sleep there is no tub if traveling with small kids no closet no dresserdrawers no black out curtains my shower had a pile of goo where the soap dispenser had leaked the pillow cases were too small for the pillows the alarm clock was a flashing light only  no sound the room was much smaller than most hotel rooms no restaurant on sight all this for 200 a night overpriced for me no matter how trendy it was to top it all off i couldnt even get a pen i had paperwork to do and the only thing in the room was a pencil really how cheap is that,2.0
good location,"near water tower just of michigan avenue well served by buses spotlessly clean rooms  bathrooms great ac good exercise room
a bit of noise though  from rooms across the narrow corridor and on the corridor itself the doors seem to be thin and make an awful racket when being closed
difficult to park out front when dropping off bags no free wifi",4.0
welcoming friendly clean,"i have stayed in several hotels in san francisco for the agu fall meeting that happens annually i have really enjoyed every hotel i stayed in orchard omni seal point inn marriott  but there is something a little more personal about the galleria park that i really liked its very covenient for the moscone and although the room i had was quite small with not much view just a regular queen i felt that i didnt need any more room than that because it was so wellput together the reception staff were very friendly and helpful i expect to return to this one 
thats a 48 rather than a 5  clock radio didnt work and was a bit grubby",5.0
a very happy and relaxing vacation,we stayed in a king suite which was very clean and comfortable my sister and her family had an adjoining suite arranged by the hotel in advance and together our families had a lot of space the hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel layout and facilities were much better than i had expected the resort facilities were fantastic and a real pleasure to use we used the tennis minigolf lazy river and regular pool  all good the casita village looked like a lovely place to stay thats something to try on another trip in summary we all had a brilliant vacation and would not hesitate to stay again,5.0
classic hotel perfect location thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"we stayed for 3 nights at the waldorf in january 06 to be honest i was originally overjoyed at being able to book the hotel for a reasonable price but then after reading reviews on this site was quite worried about what we would find
we checked in effortlessly our bags were taken from us as soon we arrived check in was flawless with no queue and extremely helpful staff we could not access our room straight away but this was not a problem because we had no bags to carry and had been able to check our valuables into a safety deposit box so we went and grabbed some lunch and got our bearings before getting the room key
our room was on the 11th floor and as soon as i opened the door my heart sank  it was for want of a better description a dump  dirty net curtains peeling wallpaper  no tea or coffee facilities  old formica furniture as we were at the hotel with friends i went straight up to the 16th floor to check out their room which was lovely
i went back to our room stopped my husband from unpacking and off we trotted to reception  prepared to do battle the guy behind the desk couldnt have been nicer i didnt have to go into any detail as soon as i said i wasnt happy he said he would move us he offered us a choice of rooms and recommended that we take the one on the 13th floor which we did the room was lovely and we settled in to enjoy a wonderful 4 days in new york
apparently the hotel is being renovated and they have not reached the 11th floor yet so when they give you your keys check if the room has been renovated and if it hasnt dont even get in the lift
apart from the hiccup with the room which was easily sorted we found everything else about the hotel perfect the staff were really helpful and friendly and the hotel was really clean
yes the hotel is old and no its not modern so if you like shiny chrome and minimalism dont book the waldorf but if you want to be taken back to a golden age of class and gandeur then book this hotel",5.0
giraffe stands above the crowd,the hotel giraffe is large enough to have ample amenitites and small enough to have an intimate ambiance the king room is sizeable and well appointed with a balcony overlooking park over the weekend there were two excelllent concierges who did not fail in securing us some fantastic restaurant recommendations the complimentary breakfast and afternoon happy hour had a little something for everyone one elevator was out of service and the other was temperamental which were the only drawbacks to our experience we plan to stay here again,4.0
hip budget conscious hotel with a great location,i came to the elan based on trip advisors reviews and it didnt disappoint me one bit from the time i drove up to valet to check in the personal attention i got from the elan was great the wine  cheese daily happy hour is a nice touch at the end of the day for all you shoppers its only 1 block away from the beverly center i will be back,5.0
liked staying at tuscon inn,i booked this hotel via bookingcom at klm website i went through a lot of reviews and the one from frommers guide was most helpful i got a good rate and no prepayment from the klm website linked to bookingcom tuscon inn was near the pier 39 which is a great location checking in and out was easy the staff were very helpful the room was nice good size and quite clean the bathroom was big and clean as well although i was alone room was good enough for a couple the hotel had free coffee and drinks everyday and free access to wireless internet the adjacent served nice breakfast great location and hotel try and not book anything from the hotel though just walk up pier 39 and you will have more choice the hotel does arrange a shuttle to the airport without any extra charge,5.0
great location,we had a great experience at this hotel in april 12 the location is great away from the downtown so you have a chance to unwind after all the activities of the day great pool and hot tub definatly not 5 star quality but good for the price aprox 15 min from the downtown and del mar beach great experience would go back,4.0
many issues do not book the hotel through third party,"i stayed at westin chicago river north for 4 nights for a business trip i had booked the hotel through a third party website we were a part of a conference delegates the check in was fine however there were many issues subsequently i was told that there is no free internet although the conference lodging information mentioned free internet in the room at this hotel when asked for a clarification the front desk told me that since the room was booked through a third party this offer was not available to me my other colleagues who stayed at the other westin less than a mile away were offered free internet while they had also booked through a third party so i guess this hotel follows its own rules
the quality of the beds was not up to the mark of other westin properties and these were easily the worst beds of any business hotels i have stayed at the refrigerator was not working well the shower knobs in the bathroom rusted and only one of the two heads of heavenly showers was working and the water pressure was extremely poor i expressed these concerns at the end of my stay to the check out desk finally at the end of this all i see extra charge on my credit card without even an invoice sent to me i have no idea what these charges are for the restaurant was decent but serves their eggbenedict with fish instead of baconwho does that i would not recommend the hotel especially if you are booking it through third party and it is not worth the price offered on the hotel website",2.0
martin and virginia from nz,good hotel really liked the layout of the hotel great room good view staff helpful and courteous and the little food shop in the lobby was very handy for breakfast and snacks this was also a good location for us we would stay there again,4.0
never again id rather sleep on the street,what a hole i would rather have slept on the streets the rooms are gross everything in it was broken the tv was fuzzy the clock had been ripped out of the wall and the wires were frayed  thus it didnt work either the bathroom was the most disgusting place i have ever seen there were black rings around the tub and the toilet looked like it had never been cleaned the mirror was dirty the toilet didnt work and neither did the radiator it was ungodly hot in the room for 90 of the stay the hotel staff went out of their way to be jerks i called ahead to check in early then when i arrived the woman did everything but scream at me for wasting her time by asking to check in early when i came back at 3 to check in i was told that if i wanted my bags from storage that unless you want to pay someone i suggest you get down there and pick them up yourself i paid extra to get a continental breakfast  they conveniently didnt tell me that the room it was served in was not even on my floor they also neglected to tell me that the breakfast was in a room the size of a pea and that there was a line down the hall to get to it dont waste your money  its the worst place on earth ive never really understood why people paid for a hotel room just to kill themselves until i stayed here its not like you could take pills and kill yourself in your sleep in those rooms it took the staff over 4 hours to bring us the pillows youd awake from death thanks to the crick in your neck,1.0
great stay at the madera,"nice location close to dupont
the staff at checkin put me in an upgraded room it had an elliptical machine in there which was sorta cool but i was never really gonna use had a fruit plate of melons blueberries strawberries etc waiting for me in my room
the staff had some good recommendations for places to go eat nearby id been to dupont tons of times before but wanted to try something new
i had requested a cab the night before and it was there and waiting in the morning when i had to leave at some ungodly hour for the airport odd thing was there were 5 or 6 folks checking out that early in the morning so there was a slight line at checkout but it wasnt that big a deal",5.0
pleased with stay,"i have been traveling a lot this year and have been staying at la quinta inns

top notch,this hotel is truly grand it has fab service beautiful rooms and a great location i stayed on the club floor breakfast was fantastic with a varied menu in a lovely setting cocktails at sunset with terrific views are the start to a perfect evening downtown visit local attractions like disney hall cathedral mark taper forum and the union station area,5.0
great location,you cant beat this hotel for location it is so close to times square and anything else you might want tons of delis and restaurants subway is close by and central park is not far only problem is that there is free internet downstairs in the lobby but always busy brought my own laptop which wasnt workingthey have free wifi in lobby so you have to wait forever for a computer also was there all week but friday night it was so loud outside with honking i couldnt sleep dont know if it was because it was the weekend but it was loud never had that happen before and i have been to new york a lot bonus of this hotel though is that the fitness facility is free and is well equipped,4.0
great hotel,dont be fooled by the low price of this hotel i have stayed in many hotels in and around times square and this hotel was excellent the rooms were clean and had all the amenities the service was truly amazing the staff is helpful to the extreme i was checked in by valdet perovie who throughout our stay ensured that all our needs were met we were traveling as a family and had three rooms our housekeeper was incredibly sweet and met all our needs with a smile and with efficiency i will absolutely stay there again,5.0
fab location,"our first trip to new york and we couldnt have stayed in a better located hotel for the price we paid 
45 min drive from the airport if you arent travelling in rush hour can be tubed at a third of the price 
excellent service as soon as we got there we were told our room was quite small so the receptionist checked us into a bigger room with a view of the river nice modern room with everything you need for a base to explore bathroom could be modernised but more than fine for the short time we were there 
located right opposite madison square gardens  you cant hear the concerts which depending could be a bad or good thing  macys is 5 minute walk and empire state building is 15 min walk 
i would definitely recommend a metro card for a week at 29dollars even if you are only there for a few days works out cost effective to hop on and off 
theres a bar and a diner located within the hotel which is fine for a quick drinksandwich but everything you need is right outside the doors 
shopping tips make sure room in your case century 21 department store great for bargains 350 handbags in the uk for 120 here also when we were there macys had 25 off and as a visitor you could get another 5 off
on leaving if you are taking a taxi get the doormen to get you a town car as cheaper than if the concierge in the hotel gets you one 
we will definitely be staying at the new yorker again when we return next year",4.0
fastpaced relaxation,"i had a great convention visit to the sheraton in san diego the room was easily accessible with a great view of the bay i especially enjoyed the options for dining from the formal dining room to the great buffet breakfast we enjoyed each morning it was nice to have the option to be green and a free shuttle service was a real bonus

location location location,this lovely hotel is centrally located to the theater district we had a slight wait at check in  a very nice representative brought us bottled water while we waited in queue she was quite apologetic our room was recently renovated  was beautifully appointed my only concern would be the tray in the bathroom where the shampoo etc is placedthis was dusty the hotel itself is beautiful however as other reviewers have pointed out the elevator system takes getting used to the room service breakfast was generous  delicious  served right on time the view a revolving restaurant on the 48th floor was highly overpriced even for nyc in my opinion wait staff very courteous  attentive it was prix fixe at 79 per person ok we thought then we discovered that some side items mashed potatoes 6 andor specialty items crab cake appetizer 10 could be ordered for an additional charge without any side items or special additions our bill came to 211 for two persons with my friend having only one glass of wine  me a virgin pina colada the food was tepid  not really worth the money desserts overdone  way too much happening,4.0
a really strange place to stay,"first off let me say that this is not a review of a champaign tour or any of that stuff this is a review of actually staying overnight 2 nights at the mansion on o a friend of ours was in town and booked a room here it was a suite so he asked us to stay 
parking here was an extra 30 per night and parking was behind one of the nearby buildings down an alleyway still the car was fine even if parking was pretty pricey check in was pretty easy  entry was through a door at street level so you didnt have to climb the outside steps whilst schlepping your luggage the husband of the husbandwife team who run the place took care of us and was friendly and helpful he gave us a mini tour which was great we were greeted in a room that looks like a library our room was on the 3rd floor i think and it was a suite with a bedroom livingroom bathroom kitchenette and an outside deck
okay heres where it gets hairy the kitchenette was up some stairs and off of the bedroom area it appeard to have seen better days and im not sure the appliances worked but there were no potspans it wasnt any too clean either so we avoided that area off the kitchen was a door to a deck it looked pretty precarious  wires hanging nearby etc i was afraid of stepping out there for fear of falling through  seriously the bathroom was laid out so that someone could be taking a shower and the sink area was accessable it was fine but there was carpet throughout the bathroom heres a ewww factor the carpet was not real clean as none of the place was very clean  everything was very dusty some lint was on the carpet  it was there when we first got there and it was still there when we left  i was careful not to walk barefooted on the floors we had the sitting room area with a pull out couch the couch was very comfortable and done up really nicely the pillows were comfortable and the mattress must have had a topper on it because it was not at all like any pull out couch ive slept on ill give them credit here on the other hand there was a faux fireplace in the sittingroom area it was not quite against the wall because the entire wall was hung with art work  all for sale  even behind the fireplace there was no place to put your personal items such as a table etc because every inch was covered with stuff there was a huge walk in closet which stored some of stuff but plenty of room to hang cloths there was a desk and after moving around the things all over the desk we used that to put our personal items on as others have said its a little overdone with the kitch there was stuff literally everywhere and everything except the guitars was for sale it was like staying at an estate sale or at your eccentric great aunts old house with all kinds of crap laying around  except your aunt may have dusted from time to time there is no central ac so window units were around which wasnt a problem but then you got to looking at the windows and all the peeling paint outside maintenance is not one of the strong points of this property
our room was situated behind a bookcase in the middle of a stairway the door was a bookcase and the lock was a long spike that you put into the side of the bookcase which went into the wall to keep the door shut from the inside there was a kind of lock at the top of the door to keep it closed the spike when you were gone was just laid on the shelf behind a magazine or book to conceal it at first we put the spike on that shelf  but we were in the room with the inside latch set when some people who were attending a wedding attempted to get into our room they found the spike inserted it in the hole and we were locked in we had to call the front desk to have them open the room there was no way to secure the room when you were gone the sign on the door that said the room was occupied didnt do much good because we had several people tried to get in when you were out for dinner you had no choice but to leave the spike on the shelf so anyone could have access to the room this did not give me a warm fuzzy as i had my laptop and other valuables in the room 
i really wanted to like this place because its the type of place that would grab ones fancy the rooms were not cookiecutter rooms like a regular hotel they were unique and very interesting the cabin room with a loft area next to ours was really nice as were many of the other rooms we saw the kitchen was available on a kind of help yourself basis to fix your own breakfast i guess we didnt go there because we went walking in the morning and found a place nearby for breakfast i guess id have loved it had they weeded out the junk cleaned it better by removing all or most of the for sale stuff from the rooms instead it looks like theyre not sure what they want this place to be  an estate sale where you can sleep or a bed and breakfast with interesting art pieces for sale they need to go one way or another but at present this isnt working well 
i dont know what my friend paid for this room but from the pricing i saw online its way over the top for what you get ive traveled for work and stayed at some beautiful b  bs and top notch hotels that werent near the published price of this place and were much nicer published rates for the fireplace suite  if you are not a member whatever that means is 900 per night  about 700 per night overpriced in my opinion  and im being generous here
i would rate this much higher if i were simply taking a tour rather than staying here because for a tour the place is really amazing with all the antiques artwork and collectibles the diningroom and main floor where events are held was really nice the intricate corridors and ways to get from place to place hidden wine cellar and rooms were neat all that is great  its the staying and seeing how difficult it was that drove me to the rating im giving maybe the answer is to run this as a museum and forget about the bb part there seems to be no focus to this place  is it a retreat for musicians is it a bb is it an estate sale im not sure but the mansion on o st is definitely unique
i think this would be",2.0
great property  awful service,"i stayed here with a group last spring they were in the process of renovating the hotel a fact that they neglected to tell us ahead of time i am on tour with a show so our late night schedule means we sleep late the construction was mindnumbing and loud literally jackhammers on the other side of my wall and started at 830 each morning
the staff was unbelievably unaccommodating and rude they were also extremely disorganized and didnt have several of our rooms ready when we checked in and many of the rooms were of incorrect type these problems took days to correct i had even called a day ahead to be sure that id have a full kitchen i was assured that i would and then arrived to a tiny cramped room not a suite with a microwave and a fridge and one full size bed not even a king they coudnt move me until the next day
the ironic flip side is that the renovated rooms mine was one are among the best ive seen ever clean hip spacious and totally fresh and up to date sad its wasted on such an abominably run property",2.0
fantastic hotel  location,by far one of the best hotels ive stayed in while in los angeles nothing can compare to the friendliness and service of the staff which was second to none and the room was absolutely spectacular with the outdoor terrace i would highly recommend the hotel to others and definitely plan on going back,5.0
the friendliest hotel in boston,"we have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel we would normally stay at the marriott but due to the fact that they have priced themselves out of the market we decided to stay at the colonnade from the very beginning of our stay we were met with the very friendly staff from hilary doorman to all the reception staff and even the cleaning staff everybody always smiled and said hello
the rooms were large clean and the bed was amazing
we all will all be returning next year for our annual boston shopping trip",5.0
for business in tech center area best hotel for a long stay,"i will keep this short and precise
1 location if you are traveling for business in the tech center area this is the best hotel to stay in i was here for training at a vendor site in tech center excellent property i was stuck indoor because denver had a major snow storm while i was there the hotel has everything you would need and not get bored
2 excellent pub the sports bar in the hotel is one of the biggest selling points if you are a sports fan and love to catch up on the latest games on a big screen this hotel has an excellent sports bar i pretty much didnt go anywhere most nights after a crazy day of work just what i needed
3 great fitness facility  pools  jacuzzi etc the fitness center is excellent with enough cardio machines and latest weights  systems the pool jacuzzi are well connected to the gym i really enjoyed working out
4 good choice of restaurants i had dinner at one of the restaurants and enjoyed the meal no complains there
all in all  a very pleasant stay if you have a rental car you can go wherever you want in denver",4.0
fabulous in indiana,"i am happy for my daughter who has just graduated from iu in bloomington i am sad because four years ago when she started school we discovered the conrad since the beginning the conrad had impressed us every time the staff is amazing the beds are
comfortable and the restaurant is delicious we love the gym and always arrange a facial in the spa this is a must a new spa has just taken over the previous space and it did not dissapoint great spa experience with aveda products every person employed is kind and helpful i travel a lot and this is not the norm i met the owner in the gym and i can see why the hotel runs the way it does he was sincere sweet and helpful when he overheard me with a problem with a door you can tell that people care and i will have to think of a reason to return to the conrad maybe for just a great hotel experience",5.0
like they say location,great locationclose to mall river walk and convention center nice rooms enjoyed the hot tub and sauna kids liked the pool only complaint is 33 for parking seems a bit steep to me when you already pay 250 per night for the room,4.0
great location ok property at best,on a recent trip with my wife and two daughters 10 and 12 years old we could not have asked for a better location for our washington dc trip the hgi is located literally just across from a metro station so we were within minutes of anywhere we wanted to be the hotel however is fairly basic the public areas especially the restaurant area seem to have been updated recently and felt cosmopolitian and stylish the rooms didnt seem to get the same attention and were small with the baths even smaller the highlight of the room was the microfridge area which was very convenient our room had literally no view alley air conditioning work and another building the family we were traveling with had a better view of 14th street but they reported that it was extremely noisy service not good we called housekeeping for extra towels and they never arrived also we picked the hgi over some of the higher end hotels in the area because of the swimming pool for my children oddly some of the nicer properties do not have pools in dc however the pool was closed during our entire stay it would have been nice to get an email or some word from the hotel that this was the case we probably would have changed hotels because of this over all we had a good stay but for the price of the rooms you can stay at a 5star in vegas,3.0
dont be fooled by the exterior,this hotel was great the rooms were modern and clean the location was very convenient however right next to freeway the noise didnt bother us could hardly hear it we were able to bypass a lot of the la traffic by jumping on freeway so we thought location was great the pool was really nice modern and stylish seating area with fireplace the valet parking was a bit of a pain there was a wedding the weekend we stayed so every time we needed the car it took awhile as there were a lot of people this wouldnt discourage me from staying there the restaurant was great with spectacular views of la be advised the toilet and shower are in a separate room next to the sink vanity there is no door to the sink and the door to the toiletshower is blurred glass you cant see through clearly but you can definitely see through so if you are staying with your partner no issue but if you are staying with a business associate or friend it is a bit uncomfortable and weird,5.0
a 4 star hotel at an awesome location for a 3 star rate,"the best thing about hotel 71 is definitely the location its in the very heart of chicago overlooking the river and almost any room as an awesome view
and you can get the rooms for prices that are way below the other hotels in the same area
i reccomend this hotel warmly",4.0
a good value in nyc,"located on 103rd street and broadway the marrakech hotel is a few feet from the broadway subway line station where you can catch a train and be in the theater district in 10 minutes hotel was comfortable our room was clean and economical and the staff was efficient and friendly my wife and i reserved a room with a double bed which gave us room to stretch out the hotel has a very nice small lounge where you can relax and unwind after a busy day in the city located one block north of the hotel is the dinner used in the seinfeld series stop in for a coffee with jerry and george while your there 
reading some of the negative reviews i must say i dont totally agree with their assessment of the hotel ok its not the ritz carlton but for the price in nyc it was fine one important fact that may be a concern to some travelers is that there are no lifts so luggage must be carried up and down the stairs",3.0
great stay,we were in town for a wedding and needed a place to stay we walked in and found a room we enjoyed the stay that night that we decided to stay a couple more nights the kids enjoyed the pool and everyone was great the rooms were comfortable,5.0
nice hotelshame about the room,we stayed here for 1 week in septembercheck in policy of only accepting a credit card is annoyingthey took 100 dollars a night in case of room charges of which we never do anyway its our 5th time in new yorklocation is goodroom was awful 408 it was dark with no daylight lights had to be on permanently  view was of a brick wall on that side of the hotelbathroom was clean but tinyhotel was nice but facilities are limitedcoffee was available in reception for 2 hours in the morning should be all day  staff were nice and helpful park avenue hotel  nice but in my opinion a little overrated,2.0
beachfront beauty,i am the head of a large corporation and i stay in many hotels throughout the course of a year rarely do i get to stay a my bayfront home in monaco but his hotel was quite possibly the most comfortable i have been all year,5.0
philly gem,"when staying in philly while traveling on biz or with the wife i always try to stay at fs the hotel is right on the ben franklin parkway so you are near everything you can walk to the art museum rocky all the way to independence mall liberty bell independence hall in between great restaurants museums and shopping great and unique views on fountain side
while no longer brand new this remains a fine hotel with a cozy feel the fountain restaurant is great for breakfast try the nutella french toast room service food is excellent as well the staff are friendly and helpful
of course all this comes at a price due to cost did not give it the top rating it is pricey but i always enjoy staying here and due to unique and convenient location great food and friendly staff id consider permitting yourself some indulgence they also seem to pile on a bit including excessive internet and parking fees also watch for homeless in the fountain area some are aggressive
otherwise enjoy your visit to this greatvibrant and historically rich city where the usa was founded there is so much to see and do this is a great location to base your visit if you have the cash to indulge",4.0
great location and property,i stayed here for a meeting that was being held at the bcec and it was great the hotel is within walking distance or only a short cab ride away from many of the major boston attractions and the service was great the only odd thing about this property is that the main entrance does not appear to be a main entrance once you walk in you walk down some steps walk through a sort of waiting area and then into an elevator to take you to the main lobby from there you need to get on another elevator to go to the guest rooms needless to say during peak times you have to wait for the elevator to take you to the main lobby and then wait again at another elevator bank to go to your room minor inconvenience overall i would recommend this property,5.0
wonderful hotel in the heart of copley square,wonderful hotel with lots to do hotel lobby is located in between copley place and the prudential which means shoppers heaven we had a corner room and the view of boston was spectacular they also run very good deals at this hotel especially for marriott rewards members we got our corner room on the 23rd floor for just 129 for sushi lovers you must try the philadelphia roll at the sushi bar in the lobby my husband is a sushi fanatic  he says it is some of the best hes ever had anywhere the cheesecake factory food was terrible but the banana cream cheesecake was fabulous skip the meal here and just go for dessert also just a 5 minute walk to copley station green line trust me that is the station you want to pick up the t it is very safe to travel in boston on the green  red lines stay away from the orange line on the mbta its a little shady,5.0
fantastic customer service,we stayed here for 10 days the location for us was perfectthe nude bar is not next door but you can see it depending on which way you come from restaurants etc are very close old town is very close as are many attractions the customer service is wonderful the hotel was clean and well equipped free parking yes the lot can get very full but staff helps to fill in the spots you wouldnt think of using free wireless and free breakfast which by the way is well run by some of the most efficient people i have seen i give them a lot of credit as it can be difficult to work around people and a free breakfast issues we had were so minor no coffee pot in room rectified immediately not enough towels each day conditioner or soap these were easily obtained from the housekeepers i would certainly stay here again,4.0
poor customer service,"very poor customer service i will never go back there again and will not recommend it to anyone
the front desk reservation and the hotel dining each acted as if they were an independent party when there was a discrepancy in the pricing between the front desk and the hotel dinning i was told i had to talk to the inhouse dining manager because the front desk did not know how to handle it when i was told a manager would call me back no one ever did when i called back the 3rd time to finally get hold of the reservation person i spoke to early she kept me waiting for 21 minutes then told me she could not do anything because all the managers were in a meeting hello from a customer point of view you represent the hotel it is ridiculous that i have to speak to multiple people on your end to report an issue i finally gave up what i tried to argue with the hotel i cant afford to waste time with them",1.0
our new favorite,"the thing that strikes you when you first walk into the harbor court is the way the staff treats its guests not only are they super friendly and helpful they remember you ive been staying at kimpton hotels for a long time and they never disappoint this one is no different the attention to detail in our reservation i requested a fish in the room and he was waiting for us when we arrived is unmatched 
the location also couldnt be any better the views spectacular my only complaint  and its more like a wish  is that they had room service 247 for mine and lovely wifes late night desserts and snacks 
stay here and you wont be disappointed",5.0
great location,"hotel metropolis is in a fantastic location in san fran right next to powell street where you can catch the metro cable car trolley etc from not as glamorous as some hotels but it has everything you need rooms are not massive but are cosy beds are comfortable and the room is quiet the hotel is standard and is fine for a short stay 
other reviews are correct with turning left and not right when exiting the main entrance as the right hand side is a more shady area with the left bringing you out to bloomingdales etc however some reviewers have over exaggerated with the danger side of turning left  these are homeless people not necessarily criminals",4.0
great location clean rooms,spent a weekend in chicago hotel is in a great location on michigan avenue across from nordstroms  so close to everything rooms are clean and spacious  there is a lovely wine bar on the main floor as well as michael jordans steakhouse we were too busy to use the fitness facilities etc,4.0
very pleasant stay,"i stayed here with my fiancee and a large group of her family for an event in town last weekend the moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted by courteous hotel staff in the attractive and spacious lobby modern yet homey decor and furnishings made for a comfortable environment as we waited to be checked in and during other times in our trip the lobby also has a small convenience store that to my surprise had even more reasonable prices than an outside store this seems to run counter to hotels gouging prices at their onproperty stores
attached to the lobby were the hotels restaurant a steakhouse and another dining room which looked like it abuts the restaurant but is separate i could be wrong we didnt eat at the steakhouse the family event spanned the whole weekend and involved dinners in the city but one morning we had the breakfast buffet in the other dining room at 15andchange per person it seemed fairly reasonably priced for unlimited access to both hot and cold items the food was very good and all pancakes waffles and eggs were prepared fresh toorder hilton city avenue really hit a home run here foodwise few things are worse than premade buffet eggs
the rooms were large clean and wellmaintained and the beds were comfortable my fiancee and i slept in one room her family slept in several others and consensus was that the rooms were all highquality and allowed for good nights rests 
the hotel also has a business center which has three computers a printer and i think i saw a fax machine as well there is also a pool and a gym but i cant speak on those as we didnt use them seeing that the rest of this hotel is great though im sure there are no problems
there are also several large and attractive function halls one of which we used for a brunch on the last day of our trip it was clean and wellstaffed
the only real complaint that anybody in our group had was that wifi was not offered free of charge most of us felt that in this modern age of tablets and smartphones free wifi is becoming less of a luxury and more of an expectation much like cable tv
i would also suggest renting a car to someone who wants to stay here and spend a lot of time in the city its close enough so that its a short drive but far enough so that cab fare can get quite expensive especially when you factor in roundtrip between friday evening and sunday morning we easily spent over 300 on cabs
id recommend this hotel to anybody whether youre traveling with friends family or for work youll for sure have a great stay at hilton city avenue",5.0
great for sporting events at stadiums,not the greatest hotel by any means but well worth the money perfect if going to any sporting event in south philly fairly close sub way station as well to go downtown we stay here all the time when going to flyers eagles or phillies game can not be beat walk to any stadium,5.0
pictures were deceiving,i stayed in this hotel thinking i was getting a good deal i had also booked it months in advanced when i spoke to them on the phone we had come to the agreement that i would be staying next to my families room when i got there it was a different story my hotel was not close to theres when i walked in the room it stunk like smoke even though it was a no smoking room the bathroom was durty not clean enough for my little boy to take a shower in and worst of all the continental breakfast wasent much of a breakfast motel 8 has it better and you pay less i will never go back there again the pictures online make this hotel look really good and when i got there i was decipointed,2.0
clean new and great service with a smile,loved it great bar with friendly service rooms are nice and new everything works great and the breakfast is free and plenty full the staff was very friendly and the drive will pretty much take you anywhere you want to go,4.0
great location great service best concierge,"from the i made my reservation and spoke to william tune the concierge at the hotel i knew i made the right choice william really knows his stuff all of his recommendations were right on every restaurant that he recommended was delicious with top notch food and service he follows through unlike a concierge that i used at another hotel he has a great memory and passion which is important in his position when we pulled up to the hotel the luggage was removed from the trunk and sitting curbside we offered a tip to the bellman and he refused to take it the rooms were large comfortable beds and pillows there is quite a bit of history here and so much charm the hotel is only 12 block off of michigan ave and within walking distance to many great restaurants cant wait to come back
the only negative is it would be nice to have a flat screen tv with more channels to chose from",5.0
memphis is a lot more than just elvis,great hotel in downtown with trolley cars passing either side of the hotel its easy to get around but just as easy to walk we walked to beale street day and night and felt completely safe we walked to the civil rights museum one day with no problem the hotel is very clean and our room had a great view looking towards the river bridge and the pyramid the breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice we really loved our time in memphis especially beale street and some of the great bands we watched we would love to come back again and would certainly stay here again,5.0
great hotel and service,i was here for two nights for a conference i needed a small eyeglass screwdriver early one morning and the front desk person got someone from engineering to bring one up in less than 5 minutes it doesnt sound like much but plenty of other hotels would have blown the request off or simply said we dont have one sorry rooms are also well done and wifi was good i would definitely stay here again if i were in denver,5.0
another great kimpton hotel,i quite enjoyed my stay at the hotel palomar in dallas wish i could have stayed longer room was a decent size and the hotel was lovelyvery quiet and comfortable,5.0
busy expensive and less than stellar service,"this hotel is focused on conventions and massive events ive gone to a lot of chicagobased organization conventions here mostly healthcare convention rooms can be far far away from each other and in a mazelike system
rooms can be very small and loud if on the industry side the cattlecar nature of check in and check out has been ameliorated somewhat by the kiosks available  if they work when i was there in august most didnt and i couldnt print my boarding pass the latter created significant problems because i was shown to have already checked in  forcing me to go to an agent to get checked in
if you have a choice stay on the north michigan side of things the service and the amenties and proximity to fun eventswalkingrestaurants are much more pleasant",3.0
handy airport hotel,"we stayed here for two nights while attending the nascar race and exploring the phoenix area before heading to the grand canyon i used hilton points so the stay was free but we still got great service our room was really great with a separate living room area the hotel was arranged nicely with all the room entrances on the courtyard side of the building overlooking the central pool we could also see south mountain once we walked out the front door of our room on the top floor as we approached the hotel it was night and appeared that this maybe wasnt the best part of town as i had read in previous reviews but it wasnt terrible either and we had no problems
breakfast was included for us as i have hilton status it was buffet style and was quite good with service to match this was definitely one of the more elaborate doubletrees ive stayed at and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the area or who needs to stay near the airport",5.0
great value and location,i would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for good value comfort and great location we had previously stayed at hotels in the theatre district and were a little worried about staying a little further out but the access to the subway was very convenient and we were able to easily get around to wherever we wanted to go the hotel was very clean the staff helpful and even though the rooms are rather small but this is new york the bed was amazingly comfortable the area around the hotel was very safe and had a good choice of inexpensive eateries,4.0
home from home in nyc,local travel agents millingtons leicester recommended the hotel to us and it proved to be a great choice situated in a relatively quiet part of town which is most welcome after a hectic day somewhere like times square but close to great places to eat like sarges deli and dukes the hotel is clean good value and staffed by incredibly helpful staff special mention for joyce our chambermaid who always went the extra mile to look after us,5.0
another perfect stay,once again my new york stay was perfect as a frequent traveller i want fast efficient no fuss high quality service and this hotel always delivers the newly refurbished entrances make access easier and food and drink from the restaurant above and the adjacent bar always great the staff go out of their way to make me feel welcome particularly raquel ortiz on the front desk who emailed me back when she was on leave to tell me that she had dealt with a room rate problem i had with a booking the problem i caused but she dealt with it immediately all the same  thank you raquel i will always stay at this gem of a hotel as long as i need to stay in or near times square,5.0
excellent servicecant wait to come back,staying here was an excellent experience the rooms were perfectly clean and comfortable the receptionists were extremely helpful and the waiters very attentive the entire staff pitched in to make us feel welcome and perfectly at home a and recommended for all,5.0
la  celebrity style,"we stayed at the w as a family the room had 2 queen size beds and it was decorated in typical w style our 2 girls loved it as in all ws you get great toiletries decor and ambience 
everybody who works at the hotel looks like they are just waiting for a movie director to hire them which gives the hotel an even further hollywood feeling
the concierge service was below average for a w we saw a guy who did not pay much attention to us and a woman the next day who was more serviceoriented
it still puzzles me why the w chain insists in ripping off guests with things like a 9 bottle of water in the room if you stay at this chain and pay what they charge you are already in a more select crowd however regardless of how much money you have nobody enjoys the feeling of being taken advantage of i think that either complimentary water or a 4 charge is more appropriate
other than that the pool is superb great beds and lounge chairs to enjoy the pretty people the loungelobby is great for a late night drink and people watching",4.0
good for the price,"stayerd here for our last two nights on the west coast
we stayed in a king room on the street side the quiet side of the hotel was sold out apparently
street noise wasnt too bad luckily i am a heavy sleeper
room was very clean functional and huge bathroom also very clean despite the older style of room and furnishings we found it to be a good choice for what we paid
a word of warning make sure you do not get room near the ice machine it was extremely loud and seemed to make lots of noise when ever we passed it
the location is excellent  far enough away from tacky fishermans wharf and right at the edge of the italian section so many fantastic restaurants and cafes",4.0
a great hotel,stayed for two nights at the marriott rivercenter which sits next to the famed san antonio riverwalk room was clean modern and well kept ethernet cable available for 10day pool had indoor and outdoor features but was so crowded that you couldnt swim the best feature of the hotel was its central location on riverwalk making it the center of shopping and dining,5.0
nice hotel great for business trip,this hotel is not hear the beach but for business purposes only it fits the needs very clear the gym is ok not great the breakfast is ok also i am a hilton diamond member and would stay there again,4.0
dont know what i love most about kimpton hotels,"what do i love most about kimpton hotels not sure whether its the happysocial hour with wine the pat accommodations the delicious aroma in the lobby or the yoga mats delivered to the room the heavy crisp cotton sheets are a treat to go to bed in and wake up under though i do wish they used a duvet cover instead of 2 sheets
at any rate they never fail to accommodate and impress
the monaco is fun and trendy the staff are delightful the wine at the social hour adequate the room i had very large though last time i was there it felt a bit cramped  the bed took up the whole room i even met a fabulous woman during the social hour  thats what theyre designed for i guess
my only complaint was that the bed was too soft  i like a firm mattress and this one wasnt i also learned too late that i could request a humidifier denver is exceedingly dry in the room next time
but overall i cant recommend the monaco highly enough",5.0
love love love this hotel,"this is a wonderful fantastic place to stay in nyc it is so friendly yet professional and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy the room was fabulous super comfortable luxurious and well just perfect its small and intimate and beats the choices in the 50s  broadway by a mile all the grace luxury and class of the chain luxury hotels with none of the pretense 
the location is perfect just steps away from the theatres and several amazing bistrorestaurants that feel like neighborhood places just outside the door 
now i wont stay anywhere else when in the city",5.0
great location not great hotel,"truthfully got a 169 per night rate on travelzoo so it was ok for the money considering nyc standards room was a superior  on higher floor for viewsi on the 37th floor with view of chrysler building but thats all the views were of other surrounding tall buildings and roof tops
the bathtubshower had more than several black hairs in it when i went to use the shower no shower cap no coffee maker and carpets were stained and need replacing the blackout curtain pulls were broken at least you could hand pull since facing east gets the blast of morning sun early 
the large flat screen tv had snow on the local abc 7 station and all channels had a distortedoversized look the quality of this particular tv was poor but i wasnt in nyc to watch a lot of tv thank goodness i wasnt trying to watch the us open the day before
major problem with the elevator when leaving i was shaking when the doors finally opened i did immediately go to the desk and they got security on it right away and shut it down for inspection
i was in town to see the king tut exhibit dine with friends and shop location is the one thing going for this hotel and if you get a really good price go for it anything over 200 shop around for another bargain the neighborhood is full of hotelsas is the whole city",3.0
would stay there again,we would definetely stay there again if rates stay reasonable location is great  walking distance to central park and times square though we had expected a bit more from a newly renovated room rooms were reasonably clean cant complain about bathroom cleanness there are only two negative points worth mentioning they charge 3 usd per piece per day for storing your bags after check out they also charge 125 usd per call if you are using an international prepaid calling card from your room overall id rate the park central as a pretty good tourist class hotel,4.0
the reviews were right the michelangelo is first rate,the michelangelo hotel was comfortable with larger than expected rooms for a position so close to the action in the theatre district staff were very pleasant and helpful highly recommended,5.0
great place to stay in dc,great location room was excellent staff exceptionally helpful and friendly really perfect place to stay in dc,5.0
old hotel but near grand central,"i booked this hotel accidentally through priceline i meant to book a different hotel but used the wrong strategy and ended up getting this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor i made sure to call the hotel to ask if i could request a renovated room they said they will put the request in but its not guaranteed
the hotel location was actually pretty good just a couple blocks albeit long blocks away from grand central station when we checked in i reinquired to make sure that we would get a renovated room and they said it should be no problem check in time was 3 pm and we did get a renovated room thankfully although it still looked pretty old the bedroom was ok size for new york but the room felt dry was very dark and there was not enough air circulation the bathroom was really small and basic and didnt look renovated
overall i wouldnt recommend this hotel if you have to pay full price  even by getting a cheaper price from priceline i still didnt think it was worth it and will definitely choose other hotels when visiting new york",2.0
still better than mostbut service definitely not up to past standard,still one of my midtown favscomfortable and newly refurbed rooms great location good restaurant but service level was really down this visit check in was indifferent and mishandled took 2 calls from room to straighten out two different days had messages about not providing housekeeping because i had requested privacy which was not the case either day in room breakfast order one morning was wrong with no time to reorder staff in general just didnt seem to have their hearts in it some of the time all of this is definite change from past visits and i hope just an anomaly,4.0
stayed at the shelburne murray dec 911 2004,we arrived at the shelburne murray on dec 9 2004 we booked through lastminutetravel we didnt know what property we would be staying at until we purchased the room but the rate was ok for that time of year the hotel is nice the rooms are spacious they put you in the mind of a one bedroom apartment great if you are traveling with family members we had 2 double beds with a pull out sofa bed in the living room the decor is average the rooms are a little worn but nice i am a big fan of the w hotels with the heavenly beds this hotel does not have the fluffy beds but the pillows were nice the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to time square about 5 blocks from nearest subway i would stay again,3.0
modern contemporary feel,newer hotel with a modern contemporary feel nice poolspa with a tropical grotto look the hotel is near the airport and planes can be heard departing and taking off thus the name of the hotel no planes took off during sleep hours so we werent bothered that being said our first floor rooms bed was comfortable with quality linens spotless bathroom was spacious with granite countertop nicely appointed with numerous plugs and hookups for computers etc enviable clock radio with ipod docking stationrecharger the kreuig coffee maker was just too complicated whatever you do dont use the coffee packet after youve poked a hole in it  makes for a big mess and useless coffee the staff was friendly and allowed us to checkin 30 minutes early the liberty station is an interesting destination with the former naval training center having been converted into shops restaurants and office spaces nice walking path adjacent to hotel,4.0
nice hotel great location,we stayed at the sutton place may 2nd  may 6th 2012 we received a special rate because of the event we were attending which made our rate just under 200 per night including taxes there are many restaurants bars and clubs within a short walk of the hotel it is a couple of blocks from the lake and about six blocks from the nearest subway station about a easy walk to the john hancock observatory every staff member we encountered in our five day visit was very professional friendly and helpful from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff the room had a deskan upholstered chair and ottoman for sitting a comfortable kingsized bed a flat screen tv a stereo receiver and speakers a dvd player a mini bar and an inroom safe the tiled bathroom was very nice with both a soaking tub and a separate shower and a large counter top surrounding the sink plenty of room for toiletries shaver etc nice additional touches included robes and an umbrella in the room for our use room service is reasonable but as previously stated there are numerous dining options very close by,5.0
great location,"i just got back from a 3 night stay at this hotel with a school group and would recommend it it is in a great location with a subway stop on the corner and the empire state building and shopping macys etc nearby
it was very clean and quiet and the rooms are typical size for nyc not huge but adequate and those ending in 11 for example 711 811 are larger than the others i saw try to avoid those ending in 10  they are right across from the elevator
the continental breakfast was fine  bagels toast doughnuts cereal and fruit juice coffee tea etc but no protein 
the bar on the top floor is terrific very cozy and has an outdoor area the view of the empire state building from the bar at night is well worth seeing",3.0
great location not great service,"we took the kids to new york city for one night on the way to another destination the location was terrific they have a pool which has a great view but beware the pool looks 10 times larger on the web site its more like a really small lap pool 
they clearly cater to the smoking set because the hallway on out floor and our room smelled like smoke the worst part of the stay was when our son got sick and we asked for pillows and a new sheet to be sent up it took them an hour and a half to get them to us thats painfully long when everyone should be 
asleep

nice hotel great service,"my family and i stayed here during our 3night stay in boston we are a family of 2 adults and 3 kids aged 13 11 and 9 and it was difficult finding a hotel in boston that would allow a rollaway in room with 2 double beds after starting our trip with 4 nights in a suite in nyc i did not want to shell out the money for a suite in boston too renaissance gave us the rollaway and even with it open in the room it wasnt too cramped
the location was not all that convenient to sightseeing in boston but it was very close to the silver line of the boston t system subway and we were able to make our way around boston without too much difficulty
the service was great the fitness center and pool were added bonuses that we were able to take advantage of",4.0
great stay,"we had a great stay at the columbus motor inn
the location was great for our stay in the city

we wanted to go
we will definately go back",5.0
loved the blue moon,"i had the great fortune to stay at the blue moon hotel this week and found it a little jewel
it is in the new hip area way downtown manhattan and it has such a charming atmosphere
the staff randy andy larry were all fantastic and so welcoming i couldnt help but feel comfortable and relaxed
the hotel is restored and some beautiful features i stayed in the abbott and costello room
everything was fresh and clean
there is a cute lounge area in the front which hosted breakfast in the morning we also had all of the amentities of other hotels however they also allowed usage of dvd players in my room and had dvds for free in the lobby
i highly recommend the blue moon
i plan to go back",5.0

loved it best service ever,"stayed here for a conference and was thrilled with the outstanding level of service the staff was exceptional and even indulged a late night dessert craving at the bar after closing they went the extra extra mile and were just so darn nice 
the location is fantastic right on the riverwalk  on the quieter end cant say enough stay here",5.0
worst experience ever,i travel very often for work unfortunately i missed my connecting flight home and got stuck in charlotte i was unlucky enough to book a room at this fine establishment when i arrived to the hotel their was already 6 people in line to check into their rooms but no one behind the counter after some time we were notified by a maintence worker that one person did not show up to work and the other lady had just walked out no employees still on the premises knew how to use the computer system after about 45 minutes the chef came out and apologized he said that he called the executive chef and that one of the other managers was on their way and would be there in 45 minutes an hour and 15 minutes after my arrival the lady who walked out hopped out of a car and began checking in guests she was rude to me and the 40 guests in line waiting to check in after 1 hour and 20 minutes after my arrival i was finally able to check into my room only to find that it was only partially cleaned with garbag still in the trash and a bed half made i am so disgusted by the level of service that i received at this hotel that i have requested that my platinum account be deleted as i will never stay at a holiday inn again,1.0
l is for luxury  e is for enjoyable  n is for nuances  o is for oh this place is great  x is for x factor,i dont typically gush over a hotel but here goes every good review here is true fabulous location terrific staff quaint comfortable quet rooms what more to say ill go on  the lenox upgraded me to a corner room with a fireplace couch etc it was divine and sooo quet i loved the aveda products and housekeeping always gave me extra the hotel is within walking distance of almost everything you want to see in boston the staff is amazingly friendly and called me by my name everytime they saw me the manager dan even sent up a bottle of wine for me to consume after a long day walking the city as others posters indicate the hotel is not inexpensive but i snagged a pretty good rate online offseason of course the only little criticism not really cause i like the hotel so much is that there is no coffeetea pot in the room however they sent up a pot of water for me at no charge if you visit boston i would definitely go see the boston symphony performance or open rehearsal and spend time on newbury and hanover streets as well as all of the historical stuff boston has to offer i enjoyed every minute of my time in boston and every second of my time at the lenox they treat you as a valued guest and they want your business  they will always have mine,5.0
new years at the ritz,"after the 1st night our room was changed because of outside mechanical noise and flushing issues room was smaller but quieter many of the rooms are small and the carpet should be refurbished we were with a group so we saw several rooms the housekeepers could not have been more pleasant however they dont know what clean is and need more training one thing i expect from the ritz is impeccable cleanliness management was very responsive but not sure they get it either in defense of the ritz it was new years weekend and they were overwhelmed by crowds
the lobby is an old bank and is beautiful i must say that although carpet should be replaced in many areas the paint and wallpaper were impeccable 
we would give them another shot at a quieter time however we miss their old location 
mummers parade was wonderful and viewing perfect
we have gotten better quality bath products at the holiday inn is the ritz is changing",3.0
hands down our favorite hotel in houston,the perks complimentary happy hour cookie buffet  hot breakfast are unmatched my mom and i stayed for a night and enjoyed a glass of wine while getting ready for the ballet we hopped into the complimentary car service who whisked us off to the theater in no time when we returned to the hotel we were greeted by warm cookies  milk before falling asleep in our comfy clean room the breakfast is hot  plentiful overall a wonderful staywonderful experience we are definitely repeat customers,5.0
the staff here deserves recognition,"i stayed at the luxe this last weekend i now realize all the previous reviews on here about how nice the staff there is is very accurate
so true the minute you walk in here you are treated so well the staff here is great from anyone who you deal with by phone or anyone you simply pass down the hallway we were always treated well
our room was huge i didnt expect such a large space the parkiing situation is unfortunate having to pay but i have nothing negative to say about the service here the location is nice right off the 405 and with a nice little view of the getty we used the spa services and i felt they were a bit over priced but other than that it was all a great experiencethe rooms are decorated in a neat and modern way i would stay here again",4.0
the best experience possible finest downtown hotel,"thank you conrad new york for making mine and my new fiances 4 nights there as memorable as possible 
from allison at the front desk to andy in concierge who both stand out for making stay as memorable as possible
room was amazing  riverview suite is highly recommended no matter which floor your on the cleaning staff did a grand job too on a daily basis
hotel is opposite the new freedom tower and 911 memorial and is in a great quiet location with 2 subway stops within 5 minutes walk
we will definately stay here again",5.0
extremely nice hotel,"my wife and i stayed here for two nights nov 1214 and just loved it we stayed in a 26th floor concierge suite which was immaculate and had a beautiful view of downtown dallas the concierge lounge was closed for the weekend so i dont know what it was like the restaurant was clean and efficient the food was very good but somewhat pricey as is the case with all hotels wireless internet is free for all gold and platinum members 
downtown dallas is less than a 5 minute drive and dfw airport is about a 1520 minute drive with no traffic while in town we dined at the dakota steakhouse located at 600 north akard street i had one of the best bone in filets i have ever had definitely go there if youre looking for a great steak",5.0
great staff and location,"the hotel palomar chicago is located in a great area if you are interested in shopping eating and taking in the sights of chicago more importantly the staff is wonderful on the second evening the room attendant gabriela had some soda delivered to the room after she noticed we liked a certain brand when my flight was cancelled i called the hotel in hopes of getting a room for the night and gan took care of my reservation with a great rate it was so nice to come back to the hotel and gans helpfulness after a notsogreat day at ohare the room service was quick and yummy too
i spent two nights in the queenqueen deluxe and one night in a king room both rooms were clean with comfortable beds and great views the rooms are well designed with a spacious closet 
i will be choosing to stay at this hotel when i return to chicago",5.0
cool and trendy but still with a friendly staff yes please,"dream downtown is cool clean trendy and comfortable my deluxe king was spacious by nyc standards the view of the empire state building was gorgeous and the bed made me never want to get up the room offered easy connection of my iphone or any device to pipe my music through the inroom speaker system rooftop bar complete with the mandatory 20 cocktails great location in meatpacking short walk to chelsea market and transportation pretty easy cabs going uptown or down
perhaps the best part is that dream has not fallen into the nyc trap of thinking an aloof and disconnected staff is an integral part of a trendy feel im looking at you empire their staff was attentive without being suffocating friendly engaging and enjoyable i highly recommend the dream downtown for all types of trips ps  ive stayed at the other dream too    lets just say to stick with the dream downtown",5.0
opera time getaways,this hotel has made our frequent trips to the sf opera possible it is not a trendy new or luxurious acomodation but this location cost ability to park our car and walk to the opera and dining allows us to enjoy our excursion to sf worry free we know we will have a clean spacious room every time with great service,4.0
lovely room with great view,we were a little hesitant about this hotel due to someof the reviews we read but were very happy we made the choice the location is wonderful we were on the 10th floor with a view of the river and the bridge which was amazing there was some noise from the train bridge especially around rush hour when they ran more frequently but it was not that bad the rooms were newly updated bathrooms really modern and although the lobby was a little dated we really had no complaints about the appearance of the hotel they have a parking lot attached to the motel which is 23 a day but the room rates were so reasonable for the location that we really couldnt object you can take your car in and out all day for no charge but there is really no need as the hotel has a shuttle that will take you anywhere in the historic area and pick you up when you call for it the shuttle was prompt and the drivers were very helpful and polite the desk staff was always busy but made every effort to help us promptly the hatcold breakfast in the morning was fine we would stay there again,4.0
good hotel in great location with a few issues and a big price tag,"its difficult to not have high expectations for this hotel when you see hilton suites and chicago magnificent mile overall our six night stay was very good top kudos go to its location right off michigan ave with all the designer stores and across the way from the hancock tower with its great rainbow room and views 
as for the suites id warn you not to expect a sprawling layout the standard suite is as large as a regular hotel room broken up into two with a wall in the middle the king size bed in the bedroom left just enough room all the way around to walk and thats about it there are two plasma tvs a microwave and a fridge to give you some options other than the exhorbitently priced restaurants 
my complaints the maid forgot to clean our room the first morning after getting back after a long day and complaining at the front desk it still took another two hours before it was done just our bad luck next on the list is the valet only parking at 50 a night with no local public garages running much cheaper than that i hated to cough up a lung to pay for something we hardly used while there at checkin the bellhop misplaced one of our bags which caused a frantic search and wasted another hour more bad luck 
it was all still quite upscale and considering we offset part of the stay with reward points the price was manageable",4.0
nice businesshotel,nice businesshotel well situated and very good staff specially at the bar lounge also serviced nicely although breakfast buffet at the lounge could be better  definitely too few choices support from concierge a bit slow and room was made after 1600 the first day which is very late,3.0
pretty hotel central location poor service not recommended for meetings,"came for a conference at the hotel although i did not travel outside the hotel much it was a short ride from the airport and seemed very centrally located with lots of stuff to do around the hotel appears to be a renovated old building and the facilities are very nice charming and spacious lobby i had a corner room with a king bed that was much larger than i expected compared to standard hotel rooms very clean and a nice bathroom free internet was a big plus
service was poor and below expectations during the conference the wireless internet connectivity was poor specifically the section of the room where the presenters stood had no signal  this significantly affected the quality of presentations air conditioning was not working in the conference room
the front desk informed me that room service is closed for lunch and would open at 430p however when i called around 445p the room service voicemail stated we are closed now and will open at 5 about 510 they were still not open so i called the front desk heres how that conversation went
me i was trying to place a room service order but they are closed can you help me
tanisha sir room service opened at 430p
me yes i was told that but i just called and it plays a prerecorded message saying they are closed
tanisha sir they are open
me ummm i just called they are not
tanisha yes sir they are i will call them now please hold
i am placed on hold for 1 min then disconnected thankfully when i call room service they are now open

great hotel great location,"my fiance and i decided to get away for the weekend and picked dc the hotel was great from the start as they were able to check us in early noon they only had 2 double beds when we had asked for a king but we didnt mind due to the fact that we were checking in early there may not have been a king available the man at the front desk was very nice and friendly the location of the hotel was the best part it was right neat everything we wanted to see the concierge was also so great at night they helped us find a hip spot for dinner and the next morning they helped us find a breakfast place we didnt really want to pay 20 for the buffet at the hotel
i would most def go back to this hotel",5.0
all we could have wished for,"this was our first visit to new york to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and what a memorable trip it was our studio suite was upgraded at no extra cost to a one bedroom suite on the 27th floor and wine and chocolates were sent up to us the bedroom and sitting room were very large and the bed was very comfortable the generous four sets of towels were more than adequate and changed every day two bathrobes were also supplied
all the staff without exception were extremely kind polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble 
the hotel and indeed new york exceeded all our expectations 
we breakfasted in niles and also opposite in bagel maven cafe to get a real taste of new york there is the whole food market a few blocks away on the opposite side of the road which was also excellent
its true new york never sleeps but you dont go to new york for peace and tranquility and the noise and buzz are all part of the scene
all in all a lovely experience and definitely to be repeated",4.0
we will return,great customer service at front desk and throughout the hotel elizabeth h went above and beyond providing information on their killer lights loved our oceanfront room and oysters at the bar we will be returning next year and look forward to it,5.0
this is a great hotel for business travelers,"as a business traveler i found this hotel to be one of the most outstanding values in the denver area because of the job that i do im required to stay in denver on a weekly monthly basis and this property has consistently provided me with a well above average room for the price a well mannered and knowledgeable front desk staff that is cheerful and easy to work with  even during peak periods they have never walked me to another property because of lack of available rooms and that has helped to keep me returning here time after time
the reservations department and hotel management staff are well within reach should a problem arise and have gone out of their way on numerous occasions to correct any problems i have had during my stays they are never without a friendly smile and are again easy to get along with and most helpful
the restaurant and bar are on par with most equally priced hotels in the area and room service is always on time even during peak periods the food is good and menu is decent as far has hotel fare goes
the pool and spa are accessible until 10 pm  which is a little early for weekend and holidays and even thought the pool itself is a outdoor pool it is heated during the winter for year round use
the best views are on the west side facing the mountains near the upper floors there are plenty of restaurants available nearby as a walmart and 24 hours walgreens within walking distancealthough this property does have its ups and downs as any place will its where i stay",5.0
location  location lication  thats about it,"if your just interested in location than it is ok but everything else about this lousy hotel bad its old and needs an facelift they lie to you and say new renovated but is badly renovated i paid a fortune for this and your not getting your money worth

not insulated for sound needs upgrades,i give this one a 2 star since it was at least clean and it is located in a great spot it has nothing else going for it as one of the reviews mentioned this location is not what i consider to be raddison quality it is an old motor inn dont expect anything more you can hear everything going on outside your room in the hallway and in the rooms next to you the plumbing makes a substantial amount of noise the card key access points at the various doors work inconsistently and sometimes take a few minutes to accept the card andor open the door i personally dont like sleep number beds and that is what we got i woke up with my neck sounding like popcorn inflammed i was cranky after two nights of sleep and when we left with our car we were locked out even though we had paid for two full days 48 hours of parking at check in they reactivated our card so we could leave and said that it was good until 1 pm even though we had checked in at 4 pm two days before how nice of them i think we still got swindled since 1 pm is only a full 45 hours in my mind anyhow expect to leave cranky and ready not to recommend this place to anyone i am sticking to best westerns and hyatts pay more and stay in the financial district even the sheraton next door looked more appealing,2.0
noisy room attitude not welcoming,front desk at checkin clearly did not appreciate being asked questions or making conversation checkout with different clerk was pleasant room was very noisy even though a quiet room had been requested and they were practically empty have to wind around to get to property but follow the signs and you will be okay breakfast was typical for this chain  limited choices but can make a decent meal of it pool area was satisfactory comfortable bed and pillows,2.0
remarkable customer service,from the moment i pulled up to the hotel carlton i was impressed the clerk immediately greeted us took our bags and quickly checked us in although this is an older property the room was stylish and very comfortable even though we arrived later in the evening 1000 after checking in we walked next door and enjoyed a delicious dinner and drinks at fly upon returning we found the hotel to be very quiet and we slept well in the incredibly comfortable bed in the morning we ate a delicious breakfast downstairs and then strolled around the city even though we were checking out that morning they clerk graciously stored our bags and kept our car until we were ready to depart much later that afternoon our stay was so wonderful that i will make sure to stay at the hotel carlton for all future trips to my favorite city,5.0
compact ok location but are there any better,"we stayed at the new yorker hotel for four nights arriving on 17th july the location of the hotel is ok but in a slightly seedy part of 8th ave the rooms are typical nyc compact with the bare essentials i expected a room safe and there was none and same for a fridge which would have been useful during the heatwave of the east coast the bed was comfortable and filled a lot of the room the wardrobe was not as deep as a clothes hanger but there were enough drawers i would suggest bringing your own wash products as theirs are not very nice
breakfast is good at the tick tock diner tip shake shack on 8th ave and 43rd st is a good place to eat englishsized meals and delicious yoghurt ices 
we did top of the rock instead of the empire state down side was that there werent signs to show what many of the buildings were tip virgils on w44th nr times sq serves great southern ribs and burgers and plataforma churrascheria on w49th st nr 8th ave was the best meal we had in 2 weeks if you are a carnivore  dont fill up on the starters though

loved the smyth,my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the smyth i admit i can be kind of anal about hotel cleanliness and our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable it was also very spacious for new york city and it was beautifully decorated the hotel staff was also particularly courteous and helpful we arrived very early in the morning 2am and were greeted with bright warm smilesit stayed that way throughout our time at the hotel the location is great  just a 10 min walk to all the shopping in soho and a 10 min cab ride to midtown its also very close to several great restaurants i will definitely be back,5.0
perfect location,this hotel is in the perfect location for sightseeing it is a short 10 min walk from the train from the airport the plash an inexpensive way to get to all attractions is right outside their door overall the hotel is great i felt safe there the hotel passkey was needed to ride the elevator  i thought that was good the suite was great nice bed linens  kitchen it was only a 10 minute walk to the theaters on broad street we really loved everything about the place all people at the desk were friendly and knowledgeable even though this is across the street from city hall and right in the center of the city it was quiet inside the area around is ok philadelphia is a dirty city and there were lots of homeless around the bus and subway stations on market street around the corner we still used the subway and it was fine,4.0
good location and value,i went for a conference at the javits conference center and this hotel was great for this purpose it was only three blocks away from the conference center it is also vey closed to the marina  circle line and world yatch cruises and to time square the hotel was clean  and the staff were vey helpful it also has free parking and a deli next door there is a police station just in front of it so i felt very safe,3.0
nice place to stay,we stayed here for a couple of days back in march this hotel is very nice on the inside it used to be an old bank building so the lobby  atrium architecture is pretty cool no problem with the rooms nice gym  pool staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy and being treated well no complaints nice location downtown right off the main circle,5.0
upgrade made this one of my top starwood stays,"i chose this hotel as it was close to my la office and im a starwood platinum member it was the weekend of the oscars so the hotel was sold out and when i arrived at approximately 11pm they told me that had upgraded me once but had to upgrade me again since they were completely sold out
worked for me i got to stay in an amazing mega suite a bit unnecessary for my 8 hours in the hotel only spent sleeping but the 8room suite was incredible very nicely done and very spacious there was a huge entryway with wet bar area which lead to a bathroom on the right and one bedroom a table area straight ahead and a large couch area with tv etc off of that there was a room with a couch and a desk another bedroom and another bathroom with a huge soaking tub
i really cant say i experienced much of the hotel since i was there only to sleep but the little service i had was pretty good the hotel is missing some of the touches ive experienced at other ws personal notes or message on the phone welcoming me and even when i was being checked in the man seemed a bit like he was doing me a favor giving me the upgrade trust me i appreciate it but its also their choice  its a much better experience when they say with excitement we have a great room for you without making you feel like you owe them something more
i think the location is great you can walk to westwood shops and restaurants so in the morning it was easy to pick something up at the coffee bean i was even able to find street parking overnight
the hotel was chaotic on a thu night very trendy but i didnt have any issue with the noise once i was in my room i agree with the one comment about the lighting though  there are lights everywhere but not a lot of light switches so youre attempting to find the switch on each light in the dark which is a bit of a pain
i will consider this hotel again if i get a deal and it actually looks like i need to go back to my la office next month so i will check at this hotel first",5.0
modern business hotel,modern room good large bed nice view of the hirise city from 14th floor sliding glass doors to small balcony allowed fresh air in odd layout with bathroom having only bath shower and wc no mirror or basin the washbasin and mirrors are in the bedroom it felt strange shaving brushing teeth etc in the bedroom and having no mirror in the bathroom the double room had only one officestyle chair although there was room for more wifi was charged only 2 free terminals in the business centre off the lobby one was out of order good location with several excellent restaurants nearby,3.0

reception
very quick check in and at all times staff were friendly polite and helpful
room
there were two of us and we were in a standard room well supposed to be  but it was huge and great we had 2 double beds tv 2 chairs writing desk and chair walk in wardrobe with safe and ironiron board sink with coffee maker beside it fridge and microwave the bathroom had shower bath toilet sink the usuals did not see any of the chambermaids as we were up and out early most mornings with loads to do in such short time but our bathroom was cleaned with fresh towels every day and our bed made up
breakfast
the 3 breakfast is excellent value with coffee tea 3 typed of juice and milk to drink there were also muffins croisants bread which could be toasted doughnuts danish pastries large and small bagels different typed and pain au chocolat also hard boiled eggs all of which was eat as much as you want for the small amount all the plates cups etc were disposable so when you were finished you just dropped in the bin no chore for such a delightful breakfast and charming staff although some guests did find this difficult we were told our breakfast was included in our package but would still have paid the 3 every morning had it not been

great location,this hotel is massive though it has a great location with a updated interior my room was in the tower across the street accessed by a tunnel under the street room was clean spacious and being in the tower was very quiet tv had lots of channels starbucks coffee in room good wireless reception and good amenities somewhat insipid show would be my only complaint all my wake up calls came on time which is rare the fitness center is outstanding open 24 hours a day with lots of great equipment pub attached to the tower has good food soup shop attached to tower has good food i would definitely stay here again,3.0
great location,"we checked in and they said they gave us an upgrade it was a large room with an area separate that had a closet and then bathroom the bath room was small but with the little room between it was a great barrier when one used the bath room during the night the breakfast was continental good coffee and great service the room was a little warm and got crowded at times but it was great to wake up to in the morning and you could get coffee water cups from a container and cookies and fruit during the day 
the hotel is in a great location just a couple of blocks from central park and walking distance from most everything in the mid region
we were there celebrating our anniversary and they brought up some sparkling wine it was a very nice gesture we had to leave a day early due to hurricane sandy but we cut our losses since we didnt want to get stuck in nyc glad we left we drove down 48th  7th street monday morning at 900 am and they werent a car in sight real weird feeling",4.0
loved the hampton in soho,"this was our first trip to new york and we were so lucky to stay at such a lovely hotel the staff were friendly and helpfulspecial thanks to tiana and jay the location of the hotel with amazing restaurants right around the corner close to the subway on canal street within walking distance of lower manhattan
it was a but pricey but well worth the money our room was small but very clean and tidy
i left my heart in new york and wouldnt stay anywhere else loved the room loved the breakfasts great staff serving breakfast too loved the location loved the city
have already recommended this great little hotel to friends",5.0
great location and rooms but a little noisy and pillows are uncomfortable,"the hotel is a few blocks from 6th and congress two blocks from the congress street bridge and the river front and only one block from a big convention center nice location all around 
when you check in your car immediately goes to valet parking and youre charged 14day plus tip thats kind of annoying but the valet folks are prompt and friendly 
the hotel lobby is beautiful and has a small storepantry with toiletries snacks and even frozen dinners theres a bank of 3 elevators all very fast to take you to one of 16 floors breakfast is on the 2nd floor we stayed on a weekend and it was crowded on saturday less so on sunday but still managable food was pretty good didnt try the coffee the fourth floor has a gym and a small rooftop pool  depth ranges from 34 feet maybe 4 12 feet at most 
the rooms are nicer than your typical hampton inn room  clean spacious no funny smells lots of storage nice furniture nice blinds a fridge and free high speed internet with a cable included just bring your laptop the cable on tv was pretty limited no comedy central also the pillows were very hard
the bathroom was a good size with those nice roomy shower curtains and great water pressure in the shower very clean one major downside to the room  you can hear everything from your neighbors rooms voices television the sound of the curtains being pulled back 
overall probably the nicest hampton inn ive ever stayed in and i would definitely stay here again
nearby food 
 check out the mongolian grill across the street its delicious and only comes to about 10 for dinner
 for coffee walk two blocks down to the radisson at the corner of cesar chavez and congress theres a starbucks in their lobby also a seattles best at 4th and congress and another starbucks at 5th and congress 
 a cvs pharmacy is also near 5th and congress and there is a whole foods at 6th and lamar i think  about a mile from the hotel
 you are about two or three blocks from the colorado river aka town lake and its parks and paths you can get to it by walking past the radisson and then just behind it where there are tgifridays tables set up or continue on cesar chavez across congress street and hit the path there",4.0
nice hotelonce they let you in,"so its not entirely the hotels fault that our nyc trip was sunkbut it all started with the fact that they wouldnt let us into our room when we arrived at 130pm after a four hour drive or when we came back at 330pm because they told us a room would be ready then or when we came back at 4pm because how on earth could a room not be ready by then so with my exhausted 3yearold we basically napped on the sofa in the lobby until 430pm when they finally let us in having now 30 mintues to get ready before we had to leave so if your trip hinges on the importance of getting a kids afternoon nap in think twice 
the room was nice kind of small but not for nyc good water pressure in the shower turns out it was useful having a 24hour pharmacy across the street because at 3am my son was sick having been outside all afternoon and missing a nap then there were the drunk guys screaming in the hall an hour laterfollowed by the cops 
so overall its a perfectly nice hotel but i absolutely guarantee i wont go near it again again the hotel cant be blamed for the sick kid the drunk guys etcbut not having guest rooms ready until 430pm is unacceptable in my book",3.0
view and location perfect,we had a balcony room on the second floor overlooking the famous salina bridge over the river sitting on that balcony in the mornings and evenings watching the world walk  and float  by was the highlight of my trip the close proximity to many wonderful eateries the alamo the rivercenter mall etc was a big plus the atmosphere the service the tiny pool the restaurant best huevos rancheros ever were all exemplary the room could be kept amazingly cool for such a hot city my only complaint were i forced to find one is that the bed was a little soft and the pillows rather flat so i didnt sleep quite as well as i do in my own bed i had toyed with the idea of changing my reservation to the westin when it offered a big sale right before i left but im so glad i did not a highrise cook cutter hotel would not have come close to the scenic historical experience we enjoyed at la mansion,5.0
good if the price is right,a group of six of us stayed here for six nights from aug 31 to sept 6 this was my second time to stay here and we got a spectacular rate of 88 plus tax per night for a good deal the park central is good value the location is brilliant the beds are comfy the rooms are a decent size however there are a few issues which could be improved upon our room did smell a bit musty not enough to request a move but noticeable the room was always well cleaned a few bucks to the maid always helps with this the elevator system can be a pain but once you use the allocated lift isnt that big a deal the public areas are decent enough we were allowed to check in early on request which was nice the front desk staff were pleasant on arrival one of our group had the same issue of no towels in the room the only thing that really annoyed me was when it came to check out it transpired that the hotel had put a 100 per day hold on our card in addition to the cost of the room as we were continuing our holiday afterwards this was very inconvenient at no time were we informed that they would put this hold in place and as it was a holiday weekend it took a few days to clear the lady i dealt with on checkout was very rude and unhelpful on this matter all other staff we encountered were very pleasant i was there the night the fire alarm went off and i was very satisfied with the system they have in place to keep guests informed its a shame they only make their announcements in english as i had to explain what was being said to some people who didnt speak english overall an ok stay though i would probably return if i got the same deal in the future,3.0
too big  but a great room,this hotel is massive it feels very impersonal so if you are looking for personal service id go somewhere else however great room and breakfast was good sleep quality fine overall nothing negative about this hotel apart from being too big and nothing overly positive an average stay for my business trip to boston,3.0
warm luxurious urbane friendly hip base for our family wedding,3 generations the brides and the grooms family  from the ny region  filled a score of rooms and everybody sang the praises of the dana staff they are relaxed focused ready to help however within 24 hours key staff were using my name very helpful consierges excellent restaurant aja excellent details beds linens towels showers ipod stereo chicago know how to play host and dana is at the top of the list,5.0
good location comfortable and clean,"have stayed in lots of ny hotels this was a very nice stay the rooms are as described we had a high room with two queens it was roomy for new york bath was small but new fixtures and more then functional nice big tv well placed the location is very nice but be warned on a hot summer day or night a walk to the theatre district or central park is to hard but just far enough to think twice about a cab we walked but it was warm park was fifteen minutes theatres a little further very safe
staff at hotel was great note the lobby was always crowdd free internet and for food plan on going elsewhere which well it is ny you should explore
would happily stay again",4.0
loved the tomo,i dont usually take the time to write hotel reviews but i wanted to share my recent experience at the hotel tomo my wife myself and our 2 year old daughter stayed at the tomo for 2 nights in august and we thought the service was very thoughtful and that our entire hotel experience was extremely fun and different from other hotels the staff went out of their way to make us feel like welcome including giving us a variety of helpful restaurant recommendations also the rooms were cool funky and fun i would recommend this hotel highly,5.0
we loved the convenience of loews lenfant hotel,we loved the hotel because of its convenient access to the subway and its many shops and eating places below we had two rooms and one was a suite which was fabulous and the suite was less expensive than our regular room both our views were incredible overlooking the smithsonian institution museums the suite consisted of a living area dining room and bar large bathroom and closets the service was great and the people were friendly and very accomodating we will definitely choose lenfant plaza again the next time we are in washington dc the walking distance to the various locations is great i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,5.0

great stay,my family stayed at this hotel back in june 2012 for 4 days and had a wonderful time the hotel is very close to the white house smithsonian and metro stations our room was spacious with 2 comfortable double beds and the staff were friendly and efficient we had no problems with the hotel valet parking all in all it was a great stay will definintely return,5.0
great hotel,we had a room with 2 queen size beds the room was large by any standardnot just ny and very clean staff was friendly nice polite and helpful it was a little noisy for me at night but did not seem to bother my daughterinlaw as for the location i prefer the upper east side but i would never find a roomhotel this nice in that part of town for the price,5.0
absolutely disgusting do not stay here call the board of health,the musty smell everyone mentions is actually dead rats in the air vents i saw them with my own eyes unfortunately i stayed here 3 nights and when i got home my clothes still smelled of the disgusting odor that emitted from my room the place is a filthy dirty mess the rugs stink and the bathroom stunk the staff are rude and obnoxious  even when asking for a simple wake up call and guess what  i didnt complain while i was there  but yet they all had major bad attitudes they watched me struggle with the doors getting my luggage thru and no one 5 five away doing nothing even bothered to reach out and hold the damn door so i could get in easier it was the worst experience in my life do not stay here,1.0
very pleased with this hotel recommended,"stayed for 2 weeks in january and i cant speak more highly of this hotel
i was very happy with the room which was a deluxe room
room was spotlessly clean with plenty of space
breakfast was more than i expected and the staff were always friendly
close to 2 subway lines so getting around was easy
i would definitely stay with them again the hotel was quiet and i very much enjoyed my stay",5.0
excellent small hotel in great location,hotel giraffe is a excellent small hotel good location near union square and flatiron district very friendly and helpful staff excellent free continental breakfast our one bedroom suite was very comfortable and quiet i would definitely stay here again,5.0
great location even better service,this hotel couldn have a better location for visiting boston across from fanuel hall in the north end right on the water near the aquariumjust perfect and the service is even better i was there for a conference and the staff was so accomodating this is a great place to stay on a visiteven a better place to plan an event and it has had a recent facelift so the decor is very pleasant,5.0
great location in the heart of the city,we stayed here for a quick weekend getaway and found the location and staff to be exceptional the hotel is currently undergoing construction so there was a little noise exactly as expected would stay here again the next time were austin,4.0
great hotel,stayed at embassy suites in denver this past weekend with the fiancee and another couple great location we were able to walk to coors field for a rockies game and down to 16th street for a night out on the town hotel is very reasonably priced for its great location rooms are very spacious clean and comfortable breakfast buffet was ridiculously busy but the food was good and worth the lines 29 a night for valet parking in denver is unfortunately a standard so just know that ahead of time will definitely stay again and recommend this hotel for others,5.0
great price and great location huge rooms,"i got a really good rate through traveltickercom at this hotel its located across the street from carnegie hall near two subway lines staff is friendly at the desk used to be apartments for the church next door 
microwave sink and refrigerator in the room nice amenities lots of closets large bathroom and large room flat screen tv request a high floor  window air conditioner so the windows arent total soundproof heating is via a radiator and only control is to turn it off still too hot and we had to open the window 
beds were very very hard no free internet or free wireless internet price was great for the location",4.0
most rundown deceiving hotel ever,horrible place awful service they acted like they didnt care the hotel is run down the hot water barely works every floor has a different foul odor and had a different nasty motif there were rooms that you could see inside because the door knobs had been removed and you could see insideripped up wallpaperlooked like a crime scene the hot tub was so thick with dirt and grime you couldnt see the bottom the restaurant closes at 2pm you have to become a member of the bar in order for them to serve you the sink in the mens bathroom wasnt even attached i turned it on and it started spraying water all over me some rooms wouldnt lock and others your keys would just stop working there was no shuttle to the dfw airport one of the elevators wasnt working i could go on and on,1.0
great location but not as nice as embassy suites,"stayed in the north tower fairly low floor for six nights other than the partying conventioneers below our room two nights it was quiet which was a huge improvement over our last stay in the south tower we still love the breakfast buffet although 18 is on the expensive side and the location cant be beat thats all the positive stuff i can think of the experience wasnt terrible by any means but there was a constant trickle of annoyances from a broken shower handle that cut my hand and was apparently the source of the bloody shower curtain that was there when we arrived to the thowupthecoversandcallitmade approach to bedmaking our housekeeper employed the refrigerator didnt work and smelled of mildew the bathtub didnt get cleaned well once while we were there we didnt get the foam pillows we requested in advance and our inability to get two extra bath towels every day for the duration of our stay requested in writing via the marriott website and confirmed in advance reached the point of absurdity by the end of the week i did a commando raid on a housekeeping cart to get the towels we got six bottles of conditioner and only two of shampoo over the course of the week the pool area which looks lovely still was festooned with little dabs of duck poop from the three families of ducks that live there worse it stayed in the same spots from day to day ew the pipedin muzak at the pool was incredibly loud and the bass was turned way up so you got hours of constant reggae beat fullblast wed go ask at the pool shack for them to turn it down they would and then twenty minutes later some other shack employee would blast it again 
for the money the embassy suites where we stayed earlier this year delivers a much nicer facility and better service did i mention the surly sarcastic bellboy who said that no they do not have a shuttle and that perhaps the best thing to do if i wanted inexpensive airport transportation would be to take a cab did i mention the housekeeper who barged into our room at 7 am when she obviously thought we were at breakfast looking for her tip",2.0
intergenerational hotel location location location,i just returned home from a week and a half stay at the wellington about three blocks to your right the southern end of central park about 34 blocks to your left times square nearby the best burger and malt ever at the brooklyn diner the russian tea room just around the corner on 7th ave out the side door of the hotel the 57th7th ave subway stop the service 5 star the staff friendlytheir to serve you and make your stay as enjoyable as possible the room just the right size for someone more out than in the room and bathroom clean comfortable room 111 with king size bed internet free get the details when you checkin arrangements made for transportation to the airport the bed comfortable but its time is near for a replacement mattress being on the 11th floor and facing a side street very quiet for city noise factors i would definitely book this home away from home hotel again,5.0
its alright,its a great location especially on blues fest weekend the lake view king room is a must as the others have little space and no views i had left behind something in the room and after some prodding and a shift change security finally located it and had it retured to me rooms are clean,3.0
great location,attending a concert at the ogden theater ramada only one block away so we left are car at the ramada and walk they have bars across the streetresturants very conviniente i would reccomend this place to family and friends staying in denver,5.0
below expectationsi will avoid coming back,"first impression loads of people hanging round fron door smoking no concierge lobby was dark and dingy it only has a tiny seating area that resembles a waiting room a checkin desk and some drinks  snacks on sale the staff were polite but did not offer any advice on the facilities or lack of facilities
on the plus side the hotel has free wifi free buffet breakfast and is centrally located
however the wifi signal drops frequently the buffet breakfast was mainly plastic plates and cutlery with very little appealing food i had toast note  although the location is central  as a lone female on business in the area i was not comfortable alone in the evenings around the hotel as there are so many bums around there is no doorman like other hotels around so you do worry about security in the hotel too
my room was spacious though the bathroom area was too cramped and lacked quality overall the room was clean though the decor was dated and shabby and the room was overdue a deep clean there was a lot of dust in not so easy to reach places and around carpet edges staining on curtains next to wash basin etc the fridge in the kitchen area was noisy and disturbed sleep at times 
note  there is no restaurant in this hotel not aware of this on my first night with jet lag i ordered room service it was delivered by a bloke in jeanstshirtcap no hotel uniform and it was in a brown carrier bag along with instructions on how to heat in the microwave
i just wanted a decent snacknot diy
noise insulation is not great  noisy traffic outside disturbs sleep
this was my first time staying in a residence inn  booked by my works travel team as usual hotel was full i have stayed in many marriotts and knew that residence was a downmarket version but had not expected it to be so lacking in basic hotel amenities such as a restaurant or a safe in the bedroom 
it is not as cheap as youd expect for such basic accommodation
this place is fine if you want a place with your own inroom kitchen centrally located and nothing more
i will be avoiding in future",2.0
great place and good customer service,the chelsea dth is a clean and relaxing great place to stay with views of 1 world trade center from your window and courteous staff when we come back we will stay here again pretty much central to everything without the touristy feel and little off the beaten path to make a great place,4.0
best kept secret in chicago,i stayed here with a reunion group recently aside from the rooms being a little on the small side there is nothing not to like about this hotel the hotel staff was very accommodating and kind the docorum was amazing expecially the lobby with lots of couches chairs and hidden nooks to steal away from the crowdshould there be a crowd i absolutely loved this hotel and everything it had to offer the complimentary coffee and daily wine sip adds an awesome touch of class my group couldnt stop thanking everyone at the hotel for a fantastic stay a definite new favorite spot on the chicago hotel scene most definitely two thumbs up for the hotel allegro and its staff calvinj,5.0
great experience at the intercontinental dallas,"during my stay i found out that a portion of the hotel has been completely renovated and a portion has been partially renovated the brand new rooms are a vast improvement and are well worth the extra amount they are charging luxurious and definitely intercontinental standard larger sized rooms than many of the other intercontinental hotels mayfair london chicago mark hopkins san fran
the hotel is in a great area of town that is much more upscale than my downtown dallas experiences and has much to do within a relatively small area i would certainly stay here again next time",4.0
awesome hotelwould recommend over any property downtown,"the is a 5 star embassy suites in my book the hotel is very clean with spacious rooms and a wonderful poolfitness area the beds were very comfortable the staff very friendly and the breakfast very tasty i will always stay at this hotel whenever i am in denver
the only small negative i have to report is the valet parking is pretty much mandatory and its 28 per day otherwise i loved this hotel",5.0
nice hotel great staff,had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend for a friends bachelor party the staff was great the drinks were amazing room was on point with downtown feel will come back again rock on guys,5.0
if possible i would always stay at a doubletree suite,"we found this hotel through priceline and paid 89 per night unbelievablel deal
we arrived on the late side but there were still warm cookies waiting for us something i didnt realize was part of their welcome very quick check in we were also given directions to get to the airport and rental car checkin since wed be leaving early and might be in a rush
our rooms  well it was just fantastic to have two separate rooms two separate televisions a small fridge a microwave small sink and cupboards to use the couch was comfy the beds even comfier closets with plenty of space the one downside was that because our bathroom was handicap accessible there was no lip to the bath so the water tended to make a bit of a mess on the floor
we used the pool and hot tub both were well kept and towels were available even at night
in the morning breakfast is offered but since we were leaving early we didnt get the hot breakfastbut muffins and coffee and some fruit were available checkout was quick and painless
i wish we had more doubletrees were i live in nhbut whenever i travel i will certainly look for this hotel before others one of the reasons we chose the hotel was because of its proximity to the airportso its not exactly close to all things downtownbut there was little to no trafficairport noise and the grounds and surroundings were well kept and attractive",5.0
great hotel and really pleasant staff,myself and 2 colleagues were delayed in san francisco as a result of the ash cloud and picked up a great deal on hotwire at the last minute we were delighted with the hotel  great accomodation great spa and really friendly staff,5.0
great service but dont give them your credit card,i loved the service the rooms were clean and very nice i had to give them my credit card at check in and they put a 60 hold on my card which then took all my money that i had to spend on food for the work week next time i will refuse to give a card there is no reason for it i do not use the phone or the 1300 movie channels,4.0
great accomodations at a great price,slept four comfortably two queen sized beds had a small fridge in the room bathroom was large the staff were helpful and friendly we checked our bags before checking out our bags almost got loaded onto the wrong car that was heading to the airportdisaster was averted and it all got straightened out the locaton was great one block south of central park conveniently located near subway stations,5.0

great stay,this marriott was a great hotel the front desk staff was very helpful they even made us a reservation at a restaurant and we did not have to wait to be seated they also gave us suggestions about where to go out to eat bars and shopping the room was very spacious and clean i would recommend this hotel to anyone,5.0
too close to times square crowds,the moment you leave the front door your in the middle of pushy crowds stay one or two blocks out,3.0
small but comfortable,my boyfriend and i loved so much this hotel the hotel is close to the subway and time square the room is extremly small but the bed was comfortable and the room was very cleanthe design is really nice the staff is extremely helpful and the food of the restaurant is deliciuous,4.0
what else were the other reviewers expecting,for me i travel a lot a lot i appreciate the unique rooms the minimalist style and the simple and comfortable beds and lighting the staff has always been great to me and i have never had problems with snobbery that others have been complaining about do not expect an ordinary hotel and if you dont like the style you shouldnt knock it this hotel was just not designed for you and definity not the place for the family this hotel is not for everyone but what were some of these people thinking when they made their reservation the pictures on the website will clearly tell you what the hotel is all about i will continue to stay here while in la because you cannot beat the rates location comfort for me and the great food in the lobby again reasonably priced great for a sales guy like me that enjoys the little things,4.0
not a 3 star hotel,good beds but rooms need updating slow internet connection and lacking overall cleanliness,3.0
great price and location,"we stayed at this hotel in april and as there was three of us this was best value hotel we could find its in a great location litterally walk to the end of the road and your on 5th turn right towards the empire state and turn left towards central park abercrombie nike town trump towers etc 
its not the nicest hotel ive stayed in but for the price its very good value clean and comfortable afterall we were in new york so it as just a base for showering and sleeping",4.0
hilton san diego resort still good but starting to show its age,"overall its a nice hotel in a beautiful setting its loaded with families and kids so it was good for us as a family we were in the main hotel facing the freeway 
the good
 gorgeous setting on mission bay 
 its only a few minutes from seaworld 
 lots to do on the sight 
 nice pool area 
 employees were all very friendly
 plenty of parking spaces by the main hotel
 larger than average rooms with big balcony
 nice bath soapsshampoos
 bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows
the bad
 parking 22night way too much for the area downtown youd expect this in the area it is in the parking should be free or at least no more than 10night
 while we didnt notice outside noise we could here everything going on inside the hotel every step that was taken in the room above us every time a door would openclose in the hallway every time someone would open their sliding closet door or even flush their toilet we could hear it loud and clear
 while the hotel is maintained well it could use some updating especially in the rooms the tile and most of the fixtures in the bath area appear to be many decades old and there was a bad patch job done above the shower head like the room above must have leaked onto our ceiling and rotted it at one point
 the tv was old and the picture slightly distorted most 4 and even quite a few 3 hotels have already upgraded to large flatpanel tvs at this level of property i would kindof expect them to keep up
 took housekeeping 3 calls and 5 hours to bring us a rollaway bed albeit the front desk was very friendly and apologetic
conclusion
if they would update and soundproof the rooms and cut the parking fees id give this place the top 5 out of 5 rating it is certainly capable of we had just a few too many problems to rank it much higher than we did i would have given it a 35 out of 5 if that were an option its still a great place for a family getaway especially if seaworld is in your plans",3.0
awesome accommodation,i stayed at the mark hopkins hotel for 7 days last july and i had a wonderful time the service was excellent room service was great and the food was so good my mom always say you get what you pay for thats exactly what youll get at mark hopkins you pay a higher price for an excellent hotel stay you will not be disappointed in fact i have made another reservation to stay at this hotel while i am in san francisco for business i dont think i can ever stay elsewhere i highly recommend this hotel,5.0
homewood suites chicago  affordable comfortable great location,this hotel in downtown chicago one block from michigan ave was perfect for our 2 night stay king bed suite the location was excellent for navy pier and surrounding attractions we managed to get a 30 discount when booking so that helped with the 38day charge for parking the staff were all friendly the complimentary breakfast continental  hot was great and we really appreciated the to go boxes to take food back to the room instead of waiting for tables in the dining area the k bed was comfortable in the main bedroom and our children slept well on the sofa in the lounge area both with tvs also had a full kitchen nice to have if you want to cook incl full fridge microwave dishwasher cutlery and crockery the bathroom was basic but clean would definitely recommend for families or anyone wanting a great location clean rooms and services,4.0
great location and value,i stayed at the doubletree on a saturday night in august traveling with 4 teens it was a real challenge to find a hotel near times square where i could be guaranteed that all 5 of us could stay in one room the doubletree offers a suite with two double beds in one room and a pull out coach in the other which worked out perfectly and even with the larger rooms the price was about the same as the other hotels in the area the location in the heart of times square was ideal for our planned agenda the staff was helpful holding our bags both when we arrived before checkin and after we checked out and of course everyone received a fresh cookie at checkin which was a hit,4.0
awful closets called rooms,"this place is overpriced and has the smallest rooms i have ever seen we booked our room on hotwire for two people when we arrived we got a room that was literally the size of a walkin closet laying on the bed sideways my hands touched one wall and my feet touched the other this room was barely large enough for one person how do i know it was a single occupancy room there was but one robe
look elsewherethere are better options in nyc",1.0
fabulous hotel close to 5th avenue,this was a really wonderful hotel located very close to fifth avenue it is located between fifth avenue and park avenue not only was it in a great location it was also a wonderful hotel upon walking in to the hotel the staff were all very friendly and accommodating our room did not become available to us until an hour after the normal check in period and the front desk apologized profusely as well as provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in addition the room was very clean and nice there was a little mini bar refrigerator and microwave in the room in addition there was a wonderful breakfast everyone morning and little snacks provided in the afternoon it was a really great hotel and we would definitely stay there again in addition there was a fabulous little italian restaurant right across the street from the hotel definitely try it out one night and definitely stay at this hotel ,5.0

best location in san fran,"i have stayed in a few hotels in san fran and this by far was the best 
great location right in union square and heaps of shopping and restaurants close by tram stop just across the road only 30min from airport 17 by shuttle 
pay for the upgrade i paid a little extra 20 or so a night and got the large king suite with access to breakfast desserts and more well worth the extra this suite was huge
would highly recommend this property
there are the odd homeless person around neighbouring buildings but where isnt there in san fran unlike other areas i have stayed i felt safe here",5.0
what a gem,"my husband and i recently returned from a fantastic stay in nyc although the weather was absolutely perfect  except for one rainy night  what made the our stay was our hotel we read many reviews of the milburn on trip advisor  most great a couple not so great we contacted the hotel and decided to book directly with them
the room was a studio with kitchenette and king size bed cost 199 us for what we got it was incredible the room was clean  no bugs no vermin whatsoever the hotel staff were friendly and the hotel was quiet the neighbourhood upper west side very residential  lots of local eateries and markets the hotel is located between central park and the hudson river both are very close and within easy walking distance the hotel has a small gym and also does room service access to downtown is available at two nearby subway stations  one at 72ndbroadway and another at 79thbroadway
we have no problem recommending this hotel to others  but with one caveat if you want the rat race of times square and all the touristy shops and party atmosphere dont stay at the milburn this is a hotel for those who want easy access to 42nd stbroadway theatres note that lincoln centre is within walking distance but prefer to live like new yorkers  sample the local eateries and spend your days touring the city
we will most definitely return",4.0
good location and helpful staff yuppie nightlife,nice hotel with nice rooms room lighting is a little complicated and water conservation in the shower is a little overdone helpful and courteous staff and a nice location close to restaurants and shopping a bit of a walk to the business loop though can be a business or leisure place to stay works well for both,4.0
best red roof inn,i have been staying at this hotel everytime i come in town from college to visit my parents which is at least once every two weeks and i must say the staff is amazing the receptionis that i seem to always run into would be ivan juarez and he is not just a regular receptionist he seems to have great conversations to keep me there just hanging out as a customer service store manager i belive thats what keeps me coming back great service equals great stay from receptionist to the cleaning ladies its a good enviroment to be surrounded by for a short stayi recommended alot not to mention check out is at 12 instead of other hotels they have 11  more sleep happier me,5.0

i took my flights from lax to sfo on september 9 2010 i book my flight from expedia and it was a nice deal i had from them i had to look for the hotels as well that i actually did not find good on expedia so i google and found hotels2staynet and i got the best hotel rates for san francisco and i quickly book my hotel room as it was discount going on on 3rd night it was a free night if i stay for 2 nights i get the 3rd night free of cost so it was really good and i got my flight and hotel done thanks to expedia and hotels2staynet for the best flight and hotel deal
when i reached my hotel in san francisco hotel monaco san francisco  a kimpton hotel i realized that i have lost my hotel booking print out at my desk in los angeles it was embarrassing moment for me but fortunately i had my notebook with me where i had just login to my email account and took another print out of the hotel booking confirmation that i had received from hotels2stay and everything was again on track i had been transferred to my deluxe king room with everything in the room fabulous hotel room it was my room was nicely decorated and comfortable bedding was there walls were well painted and covering with wall paper i did enjoy complimentary wine at 5 o clock nightly in the lounge downstairs 
it was my 2 business meeting back to back 2 days so i get up early and next day my meeting has been fixed with client on the phone i left early to my meeting and came back in 3 to 4 hours now i had time to enjoy the hotel luxury i was really excited with the kind of facilities they have in the room i enjoy minibar and video game a lot as love these 2 things i enjoy free surfing of the internet free of cost at it is available in the entire hotel and there is no charge for this in the night i had my dinner in grand café and went to sleep around 11pm next 2 days just vanished with the client meeting and i did not get much time to be there in the hotel but the 1st and 2nd day i really enjoy being there

very pleasant stay,"my wife and i just stayed here for 2 nites over a weekend overall a very pleasant stay completely free of the attitude weve occasionally encountered when staying at other w properties
we had room 2106 on the top floor a mega room the bed was great as always and the bathroom was very spacious with a standalone shower and the water pressure was very strong perhaps too strong in fact the room wasnt brand spanking new but the wear was minimal and yes the hallways are indeed very dark too dark in fact i struggled to find the keyhole in the door almost every time
we didnt eat or drink in the hotel so no comment on that front the lobby was very busy in the evenings with the typical w crowd with drinks aplenty
the desk personnel and doormen were great very friendly and helpful
the location is excellent the best of all of the ny ws by far",4.0
beautiful historic hotel,the brexton is a very nice remodeled historic hotel in downtown baltimore the rooms are very unique and clean they offer everything you would want such as internet and a nice flat screen tv i stayed here while taking the bar exam and it was really quiet and the staff was accommodating it was also nice to have a coffee maker with free coffee in the room would recommend to anyone,5.0

great hotel great location,"we booked our hotel through hotwire and got an excellent rate we enjoyed our stay very much as they had very comfortable beds and a wonderful bath our view was wonderful there was no jacuzzi however which would have been pleasant on a june night the prices for meals are very expensive so beware there are also some bottles of water in each room and they are 500 a bottle and parking across the street at 1500 a day was an excellent alternative to the valet parking at 2500 a day
all and all i enjoyed this hotel very much and would definatley return",4.0
at least theyre working on it,"this was a travelocity secret hotel where we got a screaming deal on one of their old rooms that hadnt been renovated yet consequently we had no free wifi or breakfast but we did save a bunch of money
the place has a lot going for it it is a large complex with meeting rooms ballrooms restaraunt pool fitness room etc the fact they are renovating is proof they care to improve the brand bring in more business and flourish as an important part of downtown san jose location is good with light rail right in front of the hotel and the airport just 35 minutes drive between the restaraunt located inside called san fresco the three sushi choices across the street a morrocan restaraunt and a dennys a block away there is plenty to eat nearby
even though we had an older room my bed was very comfortable i slept like a baby the shower was nice and hot too i do hope part of their renovation is to add insulation between rooms and walls i could hear much more than i wanted to of what was going on next door and outside my door
we didnt see a renovated room and i dont know what their normal rate is but for the amount we paid through travelocitys secret hotel program we feel like we got a decent room where we slept great in a good location i would probably stay here again
oh one more thing i heard a bellman using foul language while shooting the breeze with a coworker thats all fine for the bar after hours or breakroom on his own time but not on the floor by the front door even when you think no one is listening you can still be heard by guests",3.0
excellent hotel near the airport,"this hotel is almost brand new rooms are big the hot breakfast is good coffee and tea are always available in the lobby no complaints i highly recommend the moonlight diner next door
as one of the other reviewers noted this is a hotel near the airport and is good for your first or last day when you exit pena blvd you will feel like you are in the middle of nowhere if youre visiting denver for a few days i suggest staying closer to downtown for most of your trip we only stayed here for one night and flew out the next morning
i would stay here again",4.0

poor customer service  no room service,the hotel was nice but two bad things stood out the customer service was lousey and for a 5 star hotel they failed to have room service which put us in a rotten mood bc the hotel is so far away from the city of charlotte as for the customer service they failed to explain that there will be a 50 hold showing on your credit card and when we tried to call to inquire the staff was very rude and didnt allow us to explain our concern if you go be sure to bring your own food bc they will charge you 2 for a stale muffin for breakfastdont forget they dont have room service,2.0
sls spectacular lovely service,"i always check trip advisor before and after i book a trip i have learned to take many comments on this excellent website with a grain of salt i understand that people are more apt to share the negative then the positive however i wonder what the people who had negative comments were looking for this hotel is fun gorgeous and redefines expectations when you pull up to the red carpet you realize it will be different we traveled with our daughter aged 7 and 10 they were catered to and blown away 
the public spaces are remarkable and our room a signature suite was up there with the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in every inch of the room is well thought out and there are suprises everywhere the bathroom is worth the trip alone the little touches were so interesting and the service from the valets to the concierge were really special
the spa was beautiful and serene with excellent services they make you feel special with personalization like having your name card waiting for you in the locker when you go change it would be an amazing romantic getaway or as we found a great family vacation as well
the bazaar was unique as was the vast amount of celebrities just hanging out there
thanks sls  great trip",5.0
handlery helped us have a great honeymoon,"after our unfortunate incident with the nob hill hotel the handlery hotel was perfect we stayed with them for five nights in sf we booked the rooftop garden suite which was gorgeous we had a sitting area outside a queen size bed small interior sitting area and a small kitchenette fridge microwave sink
the location is great tons of shops and restaurants within just a couple blocks we ate at the restaurant downstairs and its very good the staff was incredibly helpful especially the concierge who helped us get dinner reservations and tell us how to get places
everything was very clean and well kept we didnt use the swimming pool but it looked very pretty and cleam a big thank you to jon handlery and his staff for the complimentary flowers snacks and champagne you guys really made our honeymoon great",5.0
a warm welcome,"my husband and i had not planned on staying in nyc but our flight from africa was late putting us in the middle of a blizzard at jfk we missed our connection and spent a good hour on the icy floor of jfks terminal trying to find a decent hotel that was vacant over halloween weekend 
finally i reached the smyth hotel and they were such a blessing they sent a limo to pick us up which was a very nice touch the line for cabs was around the terminal and not promisingplus the snow made the air just bitter cold coming from 100 plus degree weather into it was a nasty surprise
we arrived at the smyth around 1030 pm and were warmly welcomed our room was on the smaller side but modern which i like also very clean room service was very good the staff was friendly and helpful we were on a higher floor and i do not recall a lot of noise from the street we slept very well for 6 hours until we had to be back at jfk
i will always keep them on backup for when i am stranded in nyc thanks smyth team",4.0
the lenox hotel  simply wonderful,"we visited the lenox hotel this february for a 5 night trip to boston booked through expedia
from the first moment that we arrived at the hotel we were absolutely thrilled with both the premises and the service
the first encounter with lenox staff is the doormen who are polite helpful and friendly they really do help create a fabulous first impression of this hotel and the strong boston accent is a real welcome when you are new to the city
the hotel lobby is immaculate and greets you with a really warm and inviting atmosphere  especially during the cold month of february the roaring fire tasteful décor and mood lighting all help to set the tone for the hotel  welcoming with a sense of luxury and charm 
before check in you are greeted by the concierge staff and asked if you would like your bags taken to your room obviously being in america a tip is expected but as you are politely asked if you would like this service you feel under no pressure we did take up this service and felt that it was well worth the tip
upon check in we were informed that we would be staying in a junior suite and within minutes were presented with our key cards  check in at the lenox is quick and easy the front desk staff are more than polite they did all they could to not only welcome us when we arrived but also made us feel welcome throughout our whole stay each morning asking how we were and if they could do anything to help and each evening asking how our day had been 
the corridors and communal areas do not let the hotel down décor is fresh and tasteful corridors clean and quiet and there are also services such as lifts ice and water machines etc we did not use the fitness centre so cannot comment on this but from what we saw of it it look as though it was well equipped with all you would need for a work out
our room was absolutely beautiful the furniture and décor fits in with the old feel of the hotel yet it offers luxury and comfort having emailed the hotel prior to our trip to inform them that it was one of our party members 30th birthday requesting a good view of the city from our room i was overwhelmed to find that not only had the staff met the request of giving us a room with a lovely view of the city but they had also left us a welcome note and basket filled with american goodies  hersheys chocolate bags of pretzels boston souvenirs etc we really were touched by this and it just shows how the staff at the lenox do go that extra mile
i slept superbly each of the 5 nights of my stay  in the room are two double beds  they are comfortable and you are offered plenty of spare pillows and blankets for the cold winter nights although these were not needed as there was a very effective heatingair con system which allowed you to fully control the temperature of the room 
in the spacious room we also had a large walk in wardrobe with plenty of hanging space this wardrobe also housed a very user friendly safe there was plenty more storage space in the form of a chest of draws there was also a very large flatscreen tv which offered loads of entertainment channels the fridge had complimentary bottled water which was restocked everyday and the ice machine was conveniently right outside our room
the room offered many other comforts such as an ipod docking station desk and business chair sofa and coffee table and a beautiful fireplace not working  just for effect oh and the nightly turndown service with chocolates on your pillow is a lovely extra touch
the bathroom was cleaned thoroughly everyday and every detail was thought of  hairdryer phone in the bathroom plenty of clean towels if needed although the lenox are an environmentally friendly hotel and do encourage reuse extractor fan dressing gowns complimentary toiletries and even ornate goldeffect taps it really was lovely
when we holiday in america we do like to get out and try the local food so we did not eat breakfast in the hotel although each morning there are complimentary tea and coffee facilities set up in the lobby nor did we eat dinner at the city table  but we have read excellent reviews about this restaurant we did visit the hotels irish bar on a couple of occasions  the solas  and this was a lovely atmosphere with tv screens for sports fans we ate here on one evening and i can thoroughly recommend this place to eat  especially considering that food is served til late  1am if i remember correctly  great after a long day of sightseeing on this note it is also worth mentioning that although we did not use room service the menu was very reasonably priced 
i have stayed in 5 star hotels in the caribbean been on 45 cruise liners and i can honestly say that this is possibly the nicest hotel i have stayed in the staff work so hard to make your stay special and it felt so great to return home to the lenox after a day of walking through the city
practical info on the hotel  nearest t station is copley green line and this is about a 2 minute walk you are located right by the prudential centre tower and shopping mall and copley square with trinity church and the john hancock tower just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel a taxi from logan cost us around 30 including tip you must also try whiskeys bar just down the street
would i recommend this hotel most definitely i genuinely hope i will return one day soon",5.0
millennium was great,"we got a great online deal and loved millennium 
the art deco theme was very tastefully donethe lounge area was nice and the hotel and room had cleansleek lines
we had a great nonsmoking spacious room and the bathroom had ample space as well the bed was also comfortable
the staff at checkin wasnt the best but the checkout staff was fun and helpful
definitely worth the price",4.0
worst case of paperthin walls ever experienced,the hotel is overall really nice looking great location but soon enough we found out the walls were paperthin dont even consider getting any sleep in this hotel  any little noise from the neighbors you will hear as if it was in your room tv people walking people talking dogs scratching it is petfriendly toilets showers peoples conversations are not even muffled by the walls you can understand every word you will not sleep i promise,1.0
great hotel ,"my husband and i stayed here from 23 to 28 may and had a wonderful time
i cant fault anything about the hotel checkin was smooth i made a note in the reservation saying that the trip was for a birthday they wished me happy birthday on arrival a gave me a small box of chocolates which i thought was a nice touch 
we booked a cityview room and got one on the 26th floor no issues with the elvators as mentioned in some posts before the rooms are very clean and the size is absolutely fine it didnt feel cramped or anything the bath room is a nice size as well with a walk in shower toiletries and towels are replaced daily 
we didnt have breakfast in the hotel but got a free cup of coffee every morning before setting out to find a place to have breakfast
you can make use of the business centre at no cost it has 4 pcs and a printer i never waited more than a couple of minutes to get a pc 
the hotel is situated just next to a subway which was great it took us 1015 minutes to get to wall street and harlem
we walked to most of the other sites macys is a 2 minute walk from the hotel as is the empire state building times square  10 min
i would defnitely recommend this hotel and if one day we go back wouldnt hesitate to stay here again",4.0
great location and comfortable roomsbut no hot water,"we stayed at the mayflower renaissance on the evening of june 6 we absolutely loved the location and found it quite easy as we walked to the hotel from the national mall upon check in we were greeted warmly by a wonderful receptionist named sophia howard when my boyfriend and i ask for a kingsize bed for us to share most hotel employees give us a strange oh boy theyre a gay couple kind of look not sophiashe was pleasant and quite accommodating and when we asked for a quiet room we were given a comfortable corner room on the 10th floor  room 1081
although it was right near a secondary elevator the room was indeed quiet not much of a view partial courtyard but the bed was comfortable and we loved the amenities in the room the only concern was that there was hardly any hot water we had to wait five minutes with the water running to take a shower in the afternoonand a whole ten minutes the following morning what a waste of water other than the frustration this caused staying at the mayflower was an awesome experience",4.0
great place to stay,had a conference here hotel staff was very friendly and helpful room was clean and had the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in would highly recommend this hotel to anyone,5.0
you will feel like a celebrity,my cousin and i were going to the jay z concert at the garden so we decided to splurge on a nice hotel to spend the night it was raining as we pulled up our car to the curb and immediately were warmly greeted by the doorman who didnt hesitate to cover us with umbrellas as he escorted us inside we were then greeted by a very friendly concierge and asked if we were in need of a complimentary towncar any time during our stay we said yes and asked where we were heading we told them a concert and a car would be waiting for us when we were ready we headed up to the room and our bags soon followed upon entering you feel as though you are in a posh manhattan apartment and not a hotel room the decor is fabulous and immediately we felt pampered waiting for us was a plate of cheese crackers and chocolate covered strawberries which was very fresh along with a fully stocked fridge and snack draw with everything imaginable that you could want as we were getting ready for the night my cousin realized she forgot her heels in the car and went down to the lobby to retrieve her car to get them the conceirge told us that there was no need and he would send someone to get the heels for her out of the car ten minutes later he showed up at our door with the shoes we headed downstairs to take the towncar to the concert the driver opened the door for us and said that he had jay z playing in the car for us exceptional service,5.0
short but telling stay,just a quick overnight stay long enough however for any glaring deficiencies to stand out and not be overcome by other more favorable attributes frankly there was absolutely no deficiencies to overcome this hotel is was excellent top to bottom check in was supremely efficient as if they had been waiting for me to show up for some time the room is the standard layout which is not a criticism just a comment to provide some bearings the room a queen bed was a comfortable size it was beautifully appointed and supremely clean proof that luxury can be done right without the need to garish opulence staff members were excellent obviously omnis training of their staff is top notch and their expectations of service are nothing but first class other guests in the party were greeted by name and they also had stayed only one nightamazing this is one of the few hotels that i was truly disappointed to leave without the opportunity to experience morea rarity even in some of my favorite hotels omni should be commended for its operations and very proud of their staff i highly recommend this hotel to anyone desiring to stay in the central san francisco,5.0
we had a great experience,i booked online with no problems finding the hotel we easy the staff was very friendly and even provided a nice amenity for our anniversary the decor was topnotch and the room was fabulous with a great view of mt rainier i would recommend this to any one desiring to stay in the uw district restaurant choices in the area not the greatest but its a u district what do you want thanks for a great time,5.0
big room with two double beds in safe neigbourhood but with noisy pipes,"the royal park hotel is on new yorks upper west side we found the location safe and very convenient being only five minutes walk to the subway with a direct link to time square empire state building etc
there are a few good restaurants nearby and a brilliant diner serving excellent breakfasts on the main road near the subway station
central park is within walking distance as is the riverside park
the room was the largest i have stayed in in new york with two double beds which was very nice the beds had clean sheets matresses were comfortable and so no complaints there
our room had a private bathroom which was basic and very small and i could say a bit grubby the towels were clean and changed daly and the shower had good heat and pressure
the main annoyance with the room was the plumbing the pipes were exposed and made an horrendous pinging sound every 20 minutes or so all of the time which did disrupt our sleep at first but we got use to it bring ear plugs if staying here
if you come to this hotel do not expect the ritz but if you want somewhere a bit out of midtown manhattan which is good value by new york standards i would recommend staying here
staying at this hotel gives you a feeling of living as a new yorker more than you would get from hotels in more touristy areas",2.0
cruise ship pit stop,we stayed at the doubletree artic club for one night prior to boarding an ncl cruise to alaska the location was great  we actually took the light rail from the airport and it was very convenient walking distance to pikes market downtown etc staff was very friendly room was a little small  our bed took up almost the entire room however bathroom was great did miss having a bath tub but was not a big deal for one night only real downside was breakfast in the restaurant on sunday morning the room was definitely under staffed and it took forever to be served pricey for breakfast although food was decent,4.0
loved our stay,we spent our 25th anniversary celebration in nyc and stayed at the london and loved everything about it we received stellar service from front desk concierge bellpersons housekeeping and the maze the hotel is in the perfect location it is classy but not pretentious and the rooms were spacious with great views we did alot of hotel shopping and took a chance on the london not having been to ny in some 30 years and we loved our choice,5.0
highly recommended,we stayed 4 nights in this hotel in february 2012 everything about this hotel is excellent location just off hollywood boulevard comfortable rooms fullly equiped kitchen and the staff go out of their way to help you nothing is too much trouble they arranged our studio tour visits gave us traveltaxi advice always remembered our names and even gave us a lovely cake for my husbands birthday its the thought that counts and this hotel and its staff certainly made our stay in la the best we have ever had we will most certainly stay here again on our next la trip,5.0
new year in new york,"we went out to new york to see in the new year in times square its a once in a lifetime experience we wanted to do as we both love new york the hotel was great only two blocks from times square so perfect location for us
it is also in a fantastic location for all the sights and shopping being very central there is a subway station at the end of the street but nothing is too far if you dont mind a walk that way you also get to see the city there are lots of restaurants and diners in the area for all budgets and tastes
the room was a good size clean nice big comfy bed with lots of big squishy pillows a nice flat screen tv with loads of channels large bathroom with a great shower even the complimentary soap was nice we were however put in a disabled room which may have been all they had as it was a very busy period unfortunately there was no view from the room we were facing other buildings and on a low floor
the staff were very helpful reminding us to get out passes so we could get back into the hotel on new years eve and also telling us when we should get down there to get a good view which we did they arranged a car back to the airport for us which was at a very early hour of the morning there is someone on receiption 24hrs so they gave us a reminder call 10 mins before our pick up and we could check out at 4am there is free coffee in the lobby and they have juicy apples in reception in the mornings
the reason i booked this hotel was on the recommendation of other trip advisor members thanks everyone great choice",4.0
would stay again,stayed here for one night in july 2010 great location wonderful bed we stayed in room 1144 very small room and no view but it was very quiet i did not hear one taxi whistle or ambulance walking distance to many shops and restaurants a quick girls getaway and this was a great choice the parking is 50 a night so we used the union square garage and it was 32 per 24 hours,4.0
great hotel,this hotel is great we stayed here for three months on a business trip and it a great experience the staff here was very friendly tend to all our needs great breakfast buffet close to shopping and restaurants we will stay here again when we come back to the area,5.0
i was expecting more,i cant agree with the previous comment that the newly renovated hilton is awesome the lobby and meeting areas were nice and the staff was professional however much of the renovation money was obviously spent on the common areas not the room the bed is new as is the clock radio and the room appears to have received a fresh coat of paint but the furniture appears to be a holdover and the bathroom fixtures are vintage 1980s self parking in the attached garage is 8 per day but be prepared to walk a little via an underground corridor given all of the discussion of the major renovations of this facility maybe i was expecting too much but the newandimproved hilton is nothing special worth a stay if you get a good rate but dont seek it out,3.0
wonderful time,"my wife and i just got back from the jw marriott in scottsdale and were completely impressed the staff was super friendly the food was wonderful roys was our favorite because we ate there in hawaii the pool food was even really good not to mention the golf courses which were impeccable and directly adjacent to the hotel the pool area is unbelievable with numerous pools jacuzzis and even a lazy river with a slide dont forget the complimentary citrus infusion water drink at the pooli would recommend this to anyone we will be back soon 
hopefully it will not rain next time",5.0
good location but hotel needs tlc,"i picked this hotel purely for location  i had to be near nyu for a meeting and this seems to be the only hotel in this area that would be easy walking distance to my location after reading the reviews here i was a little worried about the quality of the hotel but it ended up being fine for my needs as it took me 5 minutes to walk to where i needed to go
that said this hotel does have problems everything in the room needs to be cleaned up there are scuffs all over the walls why did they paint it a dark salmon color that already looks drab and dirty i do not know the shades are dirty the bathroom looked worn one of the sheets was visibly stained ew this place needs a big clean up especially for the prices they are charging which im assuming they can get away with because of the nice location 
i had an interior room  i didnt mind the lack of view i actually saw more sky than i thought i would and it was definitely quiet no street noise  only the hum of my ac box unit could be heard 100 degrees and humidity when i was there the rooms are definitely small i know people say that nyc hotel rooms are all small but this was small ive stayed in a number of hotels in the city even in more touristy areas that are significantly bigger and cleaner for less money but this time i was traveling alone so the small size did not bother me the hallways are very narrow  my luggage actually got stuck and i had to turn it sideways to get it through 
free breakfast was a nice touch  bagels muffins croissants coffee etc nothing fabulous but enough to get your day started right 
the area around the hotel is really nice and peaceful  definitely a lot more calming than the times square area lots of restaurants shops etc within easy walking distance walked easily to greenwich village and soho by myself at night and felt safe there is a subway stop a block away that will get you uptown 
overall pick this place if you want to be in the washington square park area otherwise id go elsewhere",3.0
the affinia dumont was integral part of our positive nyc experience,just got back form the big apple and thought the affinia dumont deserved special recognition we had a wonderful stay here the staff went out of there way to make our stay enjoyable the room was surprisingly large and comfortable and the murray hill location was excellent i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to nyc,4.0
beds and pillows are a joke,first off the marriott staff was very nice almost always are been a marriott rewards member since 1995 lobby is very nicely updated staff was very helpful and appreciative for us staying but that does not hide the fact that the bed was very uncomfortable my wife thought she may develop curvature of the spine after one night we seriously contemplated leaving after one night and driving home which was 455 miles away pillows take a pillowcase and throw in a couple of towels and that is what if felt like two of the four lamps in my room 143 were so lopsided i felt we were in the titanic when it was sinking i never drink hotel room coffee and i challenge anyone to want to drink a cup brewed with the coffee maker in this room and the parking was confusing and never working correctly on the weekend,3.0
wont stay there again,after driving for 9 hours we were definitley ready to check into our room the first thing i noticed was a hair in the bathroom towel not the hair from your headyuck my husband and i were getting ready for bed i pulled down the comforter and found a big bloody stain i realize they change the sheets i hope and not the comforters but come on now i am in no way a hotel expert we dont stay in them very often so i guess i kind of figured it would be cleaner than it was suffice to say i wont be going there again i did leave the comforter stain side up when we left in the hopes someone would notice it,1.0

 if you have to stay close to the airport i would recommend the sheraton the price is similar and the hotel is so much nicer with so much to offer if you stay at sheraton i would recommend the west tower which is cleaner with nicer room",1.0
amazing hotel should be 5,stayed at andaz late may 2011 for our 1st trip to new york  was amazing easy check in very classy  layed back atmosphere  staff very friendly room was great 32 tv on wall huge bed big bathroom with walk in shower free mini bar  snacks dont think theres many places that would beat this hotel in new york should definitely be a 5,5.0
stuff like this happens only in movies great great experience,"in a few words i loved staying at this hotel heres why 1 i asked the receptionist for a room with some sort of view i mentioned i was tired of seeing a wall or some ugly building from my room he pulled out a hotel plan and explained what my 3 options were and what the view might be 
i chose a room on the11th floor on the corner i had no idea what was in store for me i opened the door and here it wasthe corner of the room was made up of two huge toptobottom windows and what did i see right in front of my shocked eyes the capitol i have never been so wowed in my life 
this room was actually more like an appartment it had a fully
equipped kitchen very clean and new it had a couch an armchair in front of the glass cornerso i sat there eating lunch admiring the roofs of dc and the magnificent sunbathed capitol the room also had a desk a very confy bed state of the art tv huge bathroom all very clean and proper
let me say that the third window in this room was positioned left of the bed i was resting in bed and i could see the us capitol from there can you imagine something more movie like rooms like this reminded me of highrise offices of the very wealthy
2 now the hotel itself the staff was friendly and obviously took my request into account they were nice to give me maps and let me know how to find my way around town i could store my luggage securely for a few hours after checking out
and i only payed 75 for the room through pricelinebut i guess it gets more expensive in the summer
3 breakfast was included in the price full breakfast that is scrambled eggs potatoes yogurt oatmeal grapefruit oj french toast waffles pastries coffeevery friendly staff
the reason i gave it 4 stars is because the heating was noisy and at times frighteningif i put the thermostat on 74it seemed very loud so i felt like turning it off a bit of a problembut totally compensated by the amazing view of the us capitol both by day and especially by night

no need for anywhere else,"just returned from a long weekend in san antonio where we stayed at the drury plaza based on previous tripadvisor reviews these people werent kidding the drury plaza is an absolute gem we stayed in the new tower building in a huge riverview suite the room had a huge balcony that overlooked the riverwalk and downtown it was very spacious with 2 chairs the hotel is located at the beginning of the riverwalk but its location is excellent because it is quiet at night but it has quick and easy access to all that the riverwalk has to offer
everything about this hotel is excellent from the moment we checked in the service was great the people were so friendly and ready to help everyone that you walk by says hello and asks how your stay is going the cleaning staff are very friendly and accomodating and always smiling the true bonus here is the incredible amount of food that the hotel offers at no extra charge they have a huge buffet breakfast with hot items like eggs sausage and biscuits and gravy yum they also have a 530 kickback cocktail hour which is amazing each person gets three free alcoholic drinks and tons of yummy bar food snacks like nachos and chicken fingers if you stay on the weekends though get there early the lines for fooddrinks were very loooong but worth it you could absolutely stay at this hotel and never have to buy any foodalthough that would be a shame because san antonio has some of the best 
the hotel also has a very cool rooftop pool and a few terraces were you can hang out and overlook the city the pool was clean and refreshing with a great backdrop plus it is open until 10pm they also have a nice indoor pool as well if the weather is not cooperating that day 
the room was super nice very large with a sitting are and a nice big bedroom there were two large flat screen tvs  a big plus they also have nice large clean bathrooms the room feels so clean i had no issues walking on the carpets with my bare feet they also have free wifi which is yet another great plus it also has managed to keep some of the historic feel to it while still being quite modern 
i know some people wrote about this hotel and said that there are bums around the hotel well yes there are bums because this is a city some bums do hang out under the overpass that you walk through to get tofrom the hotel to riverwalk however this has nothing to do with the hotel and it not something that they can fix the bums are nowhere near the hotel plus the hotel is only accessable with your hotel card so there is no chance that random people can just wander in its a city the bums are there ignore them and they ignore you plus you can walk on the street side to get to the hotel as well if that makes you more comfortable 
seriously this hotel is the best we loved loved loved every aspect of the hotel and our stay in san antonio the staff is great the beds are comfy and the food is plentiful there should be no other choice when staying in sa the drury is a great great hotel and i wish they had more locations i would return in a heartbeat",5.0
fabulous choice for the family,we spent a week at the ocean park inn and could not be happier with our experience we will definitely return the hotel is perfectly situated with a beautiful view of the ocean and everything you could need within walking distance the staff is fantastic and the rooms pool breakfast and amenities are just right safe clean fun friendly convenient simple and relaxing perfect beach hotel,5.0
what a great place,i stay in top hotels all over the country and have to say this is one of the best the hotel simply has something for everyone and is in a great location i was there with my family at the end of may 2006 and everyone loved it this hotel has to be one of the best hotels ive stayed in i stayed in two other hyatts on my trip and neither compared to this one thanks guys,5.0
great location and excellent little find,"we found such good reviews on tripadvisor that we decided to give the charlesmark hotel a go it is in the heart of boston right across from the t and is priced very well it is recently renovated the breakfast was good and the staff is extremely friendly a nice touch was the xm radaio in the rooms and the complimentary bottled water each morning
it is in walking distance to the new apple store the shops on newbury trinity church boston commons you name it overall excellent stay and we would stay again",5.0
loved the old town inn,it was my first visit to california i had no idea of hotels or anything in the area i needed i found the old town inn online but called them to make the reservation they gave me great rates while the area isnt the greatest for sight seeing i was very glad i chose to book with them very clean and i had everything i might possilby need included breakfast a nice pool and the over all look of the outsideplant life and hotel was very attractive and relaxing for me they even made arrangements for a taxi service for me to get around the staff was so helpful and so friendly if i ever get back to the area i would be sure to rebook with them or suggest to friends ,5.0
our new fave hotel in seattle,"we always rent a car so the locations fabulous for us  youre so close to i5 and 45th street that getting anywhere in town is simple and fast and free parking in a secure garage cant be beat if youre doing the usual tourist stuff theyll drop you off downtown in their shuttle
the design is modern but not too wild the beds are comfy and the views gorgeous the bathroom layout is great for two people the toilet and shower are in a private room and theres a large vanity in the dressing area separated from the sleeping area by a freestanding closet that opens from both sides
free breakfast is soso but you get what you pay for
the people who work here were very helpful and polite housekeeping stayed out of our hair when we wanted to sleep in and yet managed to clean the room every day
we paid 145 a night for a room that would have cost close to twice that amount downtown",4.0
probably wouldnt go back,"the shuttle was pretty bad the driver refused to help with the bags stating it wasnt his job 
we arrived at the hotel and the check in line was 45 minutes we arrived at our nonsmoking room with a view the view happened to be the building next door and the room had clearly been smoked in for an extended period of time  the smell was covered with a febreeze like product making it worse we tried for a new room but were told we were out of luck as there was conference booked so we were out of luck 
we had rented a car which was delivered to the hotel enterprise car rental wonderful service and parked behind the hotel i think it was 10us for the day with in and out privledges parking staff were great 
room service took 90 minutes for 1 salad 2 burgers fries and 3 sodas the food was warm the fries soggy the room service attendant was super nice though and came back about an hour later to collect our plates and give us some more towels that we had requested 
two of us were traveling and one flight out was at 9pm at night due to the mix up with the smoking room management they gave us a free late check out",3.0
home away from home,clean rooms breakfast and dinner no stale muffin continental breakfasts here easy access everywhere i have found few hotels to match homewood suites for total value and have never been disappointed by this hotel in particular or the brand in general,5.0
great people  great property,our family of 4 spent several nights and could not have been happier with the people and the property cedric and nikita at the front desk were wonderful representatives for the hilton  they made us feel so welcome and really knew their stuff valet staff and housekeeping were super as well was a bit concerned about the nightclub problem but i can honestly say it did not bother any of us in the least and our room overlooked the nightclub dont let that stop you from staying at this wonderful hotel the property is brand new and the rooms are very clean and comfortable and believe me  im impossible to please the neighborhood is up and coming  some beautiful new buildings are being built and i suspect that in the next few years our family would be priced out of it this hotel and area metro access is too good to be true and the harris teeter market i know its a funny name is on par with bristol farms for those of you on the west coast it is absolutely beautiful and a great place to grab something for breakfast or lunch many prepared items great sandwiches on your way to the metro highly recommend this hotel and thanks to everyone there for making it a perfect stay,5.0
loved it,i stayed here for 4 days in jan and it was the best hotel i have ever stayed in the room was so big bigger than i taught it would be the bed was so comfortable and soft location is great staff are really friendly and helpful i would never stay any where else and rates are great i booked through their own website defo going back here again would not look anywhere else and i have been recommending it to all my friends,5.0
nice hotel great location,the hotel is very nice the rooms were recently updated the only comment i have is i hate when a hotel renovates their rooms but doesnt redo the bathroom floor or the shower just seems like such a waste location was awesome right in the middle of the action and steps away from the outdoor mall we had breakfast at sams 3 best breakfast ive had in my life you have to order the green chili go on a weekday not the weekend or youll end up waiting for at least an hour second best breakfast i ever had was right next door at le grande bistro and oyster bar on 1th and curtis had great burgers at earls on 16th street and the atmosphere was very nice too i would definately stay here again,4.0
charm from another time,"my experience was similiar to most of those i read before staying here the hotel was built in a different era 1909 to be exact it has the charm and ambiance of an old historic hotel i greatly enjoyed my stay there though the water pressure in the shower was some of the worst ive ever experienced but i got cleanlol and my room had a door to room on either side and one night i could clearly hear people in the next room over so i could see if you had the wrong set of neighbors noise could be an issue
its only about a 1015 min walk to the convention center which you can do via the riverwalk which is a very nice walk",4.0
great location accommodating staff lovely room,we spent 3 nights at the muse towards the end of february and the experience was great the staff was very friendly for the duration of our stay the location is outstanding as well there was plenty of shopping dining and tourist attractions just a short walk away the hotel offered outstanding amenities from the complimentary wine reception well equipped fitness facility and knowledgable conceierge services i was very pleased when we called the front desk late one evening to inquire about food delivery services in the area and we were promptly brought a packet of area restaurants that offered 24 hours delivery services the staff at this hotel goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is exceptional i would definitely recommend the muse hotel you will not be disappointed with your choice,5.0
perfect place to stay for a sporting event,this hotel is located within walking distance of invesco field  mile high and the pepsi center coors field is a little farther but only a short shuttlecab ride away i stay at this hotel almost every time i travel to denver for a sporting event and i am always satisfied with what i get for the value spacious rooms great environment good breakfastwhat more can a person want,5.0
unusual and very good experience,"i stayed at hotel max for 9 days during a conference in early june and it was an extremely good value the reason i chose this hotel was primarily price and location within easy walking distance of the convention center for the price i dont think there is a better hotel in downtown seattle
the hotel had fun modern decor and the staff were very friendly intelligent helpful and uniformly young nearly all under 40 years the rooms are quite small although not all the same size for doubles and the room was clean the beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms surprisingly quiet the bathroom was clean and so modern that at first i could not figure out how to drain the sink i thought it was malfunctioning but a quick visit from maintenance showed i just wasnt hip enough to figure it out one bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew
some helpful and free amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center and a small well equipped gym on the second floor the business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests internet service in rooms requires an extra fee the gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights
the staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways i was sharing a double room with two other people
my only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason and the maintenance man was unable to fix it it eventually started working again also for no obvious reason so i never figured out what was wrong
we ate in the attached bar red fin and the food and wine were very tasty the hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center space needle waterfront and pike place market dont miss the nearby palace kitchen restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th avenue both are yummy",5.0

fantastic hotel in a great location,perfect boutique hotel offering personal service and great accommodation located close to the subway and lots of great places to eat we had our three children with us and the two bedroom room was ideal for our family,5.0
outstanding hotel service yet some unexpected flaws,"the liaison hotel advertises itself has a highend boutique hotel colleagues that recommended i stay at this place told me that i was in for quite a treat while the hotel personnel was more than accommodating i found my stay there less than what i would expect from a high end boutique hotel
the tv remote in my room was not working and the floor lamp was broken not a burnt out bulb but the socket and bulb had been pulled out and wires were exposed this could be fairly dangerous so i called guest services to let them know she answered the phone cheerfully but after i told her about my remote and the floor lamp she said well take care of it less than cordially and hung up the phone i didnt know if they were going to take care of it right now some time today tomorrowi assumed that someone would come by but few details were given to my relief a maintenance guy came by about 30 minutes after my call
later i went to lock my hotel door before i went to bed and discovered that the deadbolt and the door latch were both broken i should have notified guest services but was too tired and didnt want to wait for the maintenance guy to show up
i was awakened at 1130 pm my second night there with the phone ringing when i answered no one was on the other end ten minutes later the phone rang again the caller identified himself as the front desk and wanted to know if my television and phone were working because they had a water main break in the basement i turned on the tv and told him yes and he asked me to please check if both phones were working i tried the other phone and told him yes they were both working he then said he was sorry to bother me and hoped i would enjoy my stay at this affinia property i was more than unnerved by this late night phone call especially since my hotel door and latch were not working
overall the hotel exceeded in important areas the room was very quiet the beds were incredibly comfortable and the location is ideal but the hotel is in definite need of staff to perform quality assurance visits to the rooms too many little details were wrongthe moldy smell of the shower curtaindirt feathers and grime in the bed frame between the beds and wooden framea torn curtain in the room
after my stay the hotel sent me the usual survey and followed up with a phone call to address my concerns i really appreciated their attention to my feedback and the hotel sent me a certificate for a free stay i cant say that i will ever be in dc again but it was a really nice gesture however my sincere hope is that the hotel pay more attention to fixing the small defects in their rooms the hotel has the staff and potential to become one of the best in dc",4.0
terribly disappointed,after reading good reviews on this site we were shocked at the bad experience we had everything went wrong from the desk clerk who refused to acknowledge our existence to being provided with a smaller room than we had paid for to being told to park in an underground garage that was too small to fit our regular suv we were told a day later that there was a small garage to the rear of the hotel that would have made parking easier to top off everything the room we were given was directly on top of a very loud band that was to play until 11pm the rooms condition was poor and the shower was falling apart one of the managers attempted to make things better but it was too little too late we moved to the jw marriot right down the street and felt like we had moved from a third world country back to the us,1.0
dont stay because," if all of you who read this will book at the time the price will go up and i can not afford it anymore 
it is a great experience comparing to ordinary hotels like the boring crowne plaza next door it is purely a designer hotel with good value for money when you see the ny rates best location off time square only 2 min walk to subway
the doormen and beel boys look more like secret service agents and are connected via head phones some female receptionists have their own way of communication ny slang but if you see it as part of the whole concept it is fine and can get used to it
the loungebar is next to the reception and busy with outside guests on weekend great atmosphere they dont have a menue for drinks so order what you like
personally i didnt like the breakfast style it is more something for busy travelers very small choice on the buffet but eggs etc to be ordered and paid extra but thats the only thing what is better at crowne plaza
room
either in red yellow or blue fabrics flat tv with great sound and bose radio are in the room molton brown bath amenities and modern post cards as well as bathrobe but no slippers
make sure to get the electric do not disturb sign explained it was on since the previous guest but not recognized when the maid rings the bell it remains silent and she did not clean the room had to call in the evening to get it done also the outside line was not working but could be fixed after 1 day
overall i can recommend it to get a new experience in a great  modern atmosphere  but nobody is perfect",5.0
luxurious and lovely but overpriced,"lovely four seasons and certainly lives up to the name literally a couple of blocks from central park perhaps getting a little old compared to some of the newer hotels but it works service is second to none and an example to other hotels
only issue is the price a little higher than one might expect but the superb service softens the blow",4.0
great historic hotel that is the best in austin,"my son and i stayed for several days as i was intown for a business matter wonderful historic hotel with class and especially great if you are into western decor walking distance to good dining and entertainment really nice rooms with great comfort just an all around nice experience
my son loved as much as i did",5.0
excellent location heart of time square easy access to everything,found great deal on travelzoo got an superior king nice rooms probably a 35 stars but in nyc this is considered very good especially  200night across from marriott marquis steps away from heart of time square i recommed this hotel because of its location make sure to get the recently renovatedupgraded rooms not all rooms are upgraded yet if you want ease of access to metro to get to anywhere in manhatten this is it,4.0
wow  super deal updating is marvelous and staff was so nice to our kids,my husband and i used to stay here before we had kids and always liked it for its reasonable cost proximity to the galleria beautiful grounds and the black swan bar  now we came back with our kids and the hotel looks a hundred times better  very comfy but swanky i love the art in the lobby and the unconventional decor and foliage just very cool and we got a rate of 100 a night on the omni website the rooms were nicely updated the beds comfortable and room service great the staff was really nice to our kids which always gets high points in my book not stuffy at all and i love the fact that you can selfpark and save a bundle on parking really great location tucked away amongst an unlikely business park setting all you saints fans the carpeting in the roomlevel hallways reminds me of the black and gold,5.0
needs a few updates,overall not a bad place to stay it was quiet and spacious and clean the only complaint that i have is that the bathrooms are in need of major updates the water pressure sucked maybe because i was all the way up on the 30th floor the lighting was poor and the exhaust fan and countertops were nonexistent on the flip side the room service was quick and tasty and the bed had big king sized pillows not the renaissance but a hell of a lot better than the brookshire,3.0
great service,the elysee provided excellent service from the front desk as well as the morningevening drinks staff everyone was helpful with a bright smile each day we will return and will recommend to friends,5.0
staff is wonderful here great customer service,"i was stranded in charlotte when my flight was cancelled for 2 days die to snow and ice
 i spoke with sherri who made resevation she was very nice and accomedating
when i arrived at the hotel every bit of twenty people were waitting to check in
this wad when i met sherri she was just as nice in person as she was over the phone she has excellant customer service and took care of everyone and got them in rooms in a timely manner
when i got to my room i was pleased with the way the room looked it was great other than soap and towels missing the room was good i called sherri at the front desk to get towels and soap and she had housekeeping here within 5 minutes the next day shannon was my housekeeper who brought me towels the previous dayshe was my housekeeper for my stay and she did an excellant job she was fast and the room looked just as it did when i checked in
i also notice when i arrived that there is security on site 24 hours a day he makes you feel safe especially when you see him walking the hotel checking on cars doors and employees
just want to say thanks to sherri and shannon for being so nice to me while i was there i will dafinetly be back",5.0
great hotel  amazing cooked to order breakfast,my wife and i spent 4 nights at this embassy suites in phoenix we loved it and would stay there again if circumstances permitted our room was clean and very quiet the breakfasts were superb i had made to order omelets every morning they were as good as any i have ever had happy hour was nothing special the drinks were fine but the appetizers were pretty lousy our second night we just ordered room service and went to the bar to get our happy hour drinks and back to our room to enjoy them we did notice the hotel is upgrading all their rooms with new carpeting so this might explain some of the negative complaints from others about the condition of the rooms our room did not have the new carpeting yet but that did not affect our stay we enjoyed our time there the pool and the hot tub were also great,4.0
new york in spring,"perfect location close to times square and number of metro stations
many attractions nearby reachable by foot
good breakfast buffet with full range of cold and hot buffet",4.0
poor customer service small room,"this place was the worst place we stayed after travelling down from san francisco the breakfast was poor and consisted of small muffins there was no wifi at all and the nearest place was in a library in san diego the room was small and stuffy unfortunately there was a power cut across san diego when we stayed there which lasted from 4pm through until 4am the owner didnt even have any candles or tourch lights he could hand round to his guests  in fact he simply had an attitude of couldnt care less about him
the only good thing about this place was its location near the sea front i would even say it was over priced there are so many places to stay in san diego  i just dont know how they get away with such poor quality and service",2.0
great location,you cant beat this location for manhattan this hotel is walking distance to almost anyplace for the adventurous touristfrom central park to battery park sure itll take you some time to walk to either of those two places but the journey is part of the experience plus its within about 4 blocks of 6 different subway entrys so thats a big plus the rooms are appointed quite nicely with very modern touches but my room was amazingly small and cramped even for manhattan standards this was small it was hard to close the bathroom door behind me without having to turn and step aside other than that though this hotel is a super choice for anyone visiting manhattan oh yes and the bar in the hotel has a great vibe if youre in the mood for a nightcap,4.0
excellent location in the heart of manhattan,wow we arrived into new york city along with hurricane irene our hotel was well equipped and the staff fantastic particularly front desk we had a great time again in new york and the location of staybridge is outstanding would recommend even to the most hard to please great place breakfast a welcome start in the sunny atrium room well done,5.0

hotel carlton has become my home away from home when in san francisco,a colleague recommended hotel carlton for my stay when i was traveling to sf for business and i was treated so well that it has now become my home away from home while on business i have recommended colleagues to the hotel and have sent staff as well as i have recommended hotel carlton to friends going on holidays make sure to enjoy the wine reception in the lobby and take advantage of the location to access different areas of the city from reservations welcome by front staff to cleaning staff you will be taken care of in a professional but also personalized way i signed up for a joy of life club and recommend repeat clients do the same it is also important to me knowing that hotel carlton is a green business in sf as i would much rather support a business that is operating with environmental initiatives then not enjoy your stay at a great hotel in a great city,5.0
good airport stay,needed a one night room for staying when flying out of phoenix after touring arizona this hotel was close to the airport but not so close that we could hear planes flying around us lots of resort style plants and courtyard settings inside the hotel didnt get to hotel till late so didnt do much except check in watch some tv use the wifi internet and then go to sleep beds were comfortable rooms were clean and most importantly showers were nice and hot in the morning overall nice place to stay at also the breakfast was nice before the flight,4.0
most expensive place to stayand the worst,what has happened to hilton it used to always be a really nice experience to stay at one however for my last 2 visits in two differend citites were both bad i ended up fighting with them for 2 months after my last stay just to get them to do what they said they would do i had to follow up with them several times in order to get them to keep their promises that is really sad when you cant even expect them to keep their word i wont go into any more details of that stay because its already in here somewhere this time however we are againnot happy at all the only thing this place has to offer is the location you will find that they are experts at finding ways to get tip money from you by hijacking your luggage etc you will find that the drinks they make you in the bar will be terrible and cost 1500 each they dont even have a blender and cannot make frozen type drinks why not cant hilton afford a blender you will find that the wireless internet service will not stay connected the signal will go in and out and have to keep trying to reconnect we had 2 different laptops with us and they both had the same problem we ended up going accross the street to the star bucks to use the internet from there we also ended up using the applebees located inside the hilton for drinks there is no pool or and no spa the gym is very small and poorly equipped we also expected polioterespectfulprofessional staff and sadly this proved to not be true as well they were less than helpful with us on several occassions and were downright rude as well we understood that this would be expensive after all its times square but we also expected things to work and that the food and drinks would be good for those prices and we are sad to report that we cannot give the hilton a good report and that this is the second time in a row once in phoenix and once here in times squarenew york city we have been traveling now for over 2 weeks we went to england france germany etc and all of our accomadations at the other places where we stayed were great none of them were hilton so we have stayed in different hotels every night for the last couple of weeks and everyone did a better job than hilton we are hilton honours members and have just about decided to give it all up and tell hilton goodbye were also marriot rewards members marriotthere we come,1.0
hyatt hill country service has stepped up,"i just finished another great spring break with the family at the hyatt hill country we have visited the hyatt hill country 4 times and this visit had better than the normal really good service not one time did a doorman or bellman miss opening the main door greating us and asking how we were or if we needed anything i was looking for the ice machine and a lady approached me and asked if i neede help and politely directed me stayed with and chatted for a while i forget her name but she must be easy to id she told me she has been there 13 years one afternoon i was walking in the lobby and stoppped at the restaurant book stand jj came up and asked if he could help he made 2 dinner reservations for me within 5 mins and both were great the lil rhine on the river for steak and wildfish for seafood
the next day i was walking through the lobby with my daughters i was wearing a hat and glasses out of nowhere jj approached us address me by my last name and asked how the first night dinner was i have to tell you thats great service the entire stay was filled with great moments with the family and great service from all encountered staff thanks hyatt for yet another great stay",4.0
a wonderful stay,"i spent a night in boston with three friends we wanted to be near fenway for the paul mccartney concert 
i had stayed at the back bay hilton a number of years ago and found my experience there unpleasant so i researched the hotels in the area by price and rating a stay at the eliot turned out to cost 9 more than a stay at the hilton which would have given us a small room with two double beds and a cot at the eliot we had a suite with two queen sized beds and another queen in a pull out couch the rooms were spacious clean and lovely there was turndown service at night a friendly welcoming staff and included in our package was free parking and bakers breakfast for two
we plan to return to the eliot soon and enjoy more of boston",5.0
extremely poor and rude customer service,"first of all the pool wasnt working and they act as if thats okay not for the price you pay
the customer service is horrible they have a shuttle service that take you within 5 miles of the hotel so we wanted to go to the mall which is within range so when i call to ask they told me that they cant take me to the mall because the mall service runs every 3 hours and the next one is in 2 hours so i asked the guy you take guests within 5 miles of the hotel right and he answered yes but just not the mall so i tell him if i find something close to the mall will you take me there he was like yes so i said can you just take me to the mall then and he was like sorry we cant do that mall shuttles run every 3 hours
are you serious so i ended up looking up a restaurant half a mile away from the mall and going down to the shuttle desk the guy i had just spoken to was there i ask them to take the to the restaurant he asked me if it was near the mall i said yes but you wont take me to the mall so
then he started being dumb was like well if you have asked me for a favor i would have said yes are you kidding me you are a 4 star hotel you should have been taught customer service and offered me a ride there when i asked over the phone
never staying here again",1.0
was scared  but wasnt too bad,"the reviews on trip advisor had me freaked out however i was traveling in a group and most of them were med students who couldnt afford the 400 hotel rooms may is a busy month in bean town with graduations etc and everything was booked up months ago so we decided on copley house as they were the only ones with reasonable rates we paid about 245 one bedroom which had ample room for 5 people per apartment
we were a group of 15 people celebrating a 30th birthday we got three apartments 2 one bedrooms and one studio each had its own charm a fire place copious mirors large kitchen etc etc
 i will admit that the carpets were dusty and the blinds let light through but the kitchen was adequate enough to make some scrambled eggs and toast the couch pulls out in all rooms and is just as comfy as the bed in the room  not the comfiest but isnt that bad the pillows are on the thin side make no mistake these are no westin beds 
i took my own towels and toiletries but they had supplied towels and basic toiletries the maids clean the room once a day but they dont do a good job one of the bathrooms had hair and lint that looked like it had been there for a week
the check in is smooth and the staff are very friendly perfect location right next to the copley plaza and the prudential centre you are next to three t subway stops prudential copley and back bay 
free wifi was great they have limited parking spots at 10night but they gave it to us for free 
we were a group with different levels of income and we all agreed that this place was good for what we needed for the weekend we came prepared and expecting the worst  so admittedly our expectations were low the management is in the process of repainting and repairing things so they clearly do read these message boards as for those complaining about flights of stairs  welcome to boston thats how most apartments are",3.0
everything the reviews had said  and more,"my wife and i had a wonderful 5 night stay at the library hotel  accomodation and service were excellent the only reason our expectations werent exceeded was that we had read so many great reviews before we visited that we were not surprised by the high standards this hotel has set the bar very high for itself but unlike many establishments it seems consistently able to maintain those high standards
we were in a suite on the 3rd floor facing onto madison ave  well worth the extra money for the views and the larger room 
i endorse all the great reviews that have gone before on this hotel  no point in going over it all again accomodation  service and staff all top class and i wouldnt hesitiate to recommend this hotel and will stay here again when back in nyc
2 minor negative points  there is a fair amount of traffic noise to be heard on the lower floors  but not a major problem and as other reviewers have said the rooftop terrace bar is very busy most evenings  but then thats down to the quality of the place isnt it",5.0
beware of the sir charges,apart from the location great but it stops there upon checkin i was informed i would have a queen bed i asked for a king size bed and i was told there would be a charge for going up to a king give me a break a surcharge for going from a queen to a king when i got up to the room it was like a oven i could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service everything in the room had a charge associated to it even down to the coffee 100 now whats up with that i was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom very small i have stayed there twice and with so many other options i feel this will be my last,2.0
very pleased with accommodations and service,we booked this room through a third party but were treated like we were a frequent guest the room was spacious clean with a nice view everyone we interfaced with provided friendly service we would definitely stay there again,4.0
nice hotel  really busy,the hotel is very nice it has an old world feel to it  very high end looking the room was comfortable and clean the bed a little hard the service was great i really dont have any complaints i just didnt prefer the busyness of it all it is a rather large hotel that hosts lots of events it is noisy in the common areas and with what seemed to be several weddingsparties going on it was a bit overwhelming location is great,4.0
nice hotel in a great location,i recently stayed here for a business trip the room is well appointed and the beds are quite comfortable there is a restaurant onsite and the food is pretty good the hotel is located in the heart of downtown so practically everything is within walking distance,4.0
superb romantic weekend getaway,we recently spent a very romantic weekend at thia fabulous historic spanish colonial hotel the river view rooms are worth the extra charge the restaurant las canarias was so good we went back for lunch and dinner everything from the venison to the very fresh halibut was great service is friendly and very good they seemed to anticipate my every need,5.0
business trip,i was pleasantly surprised by this hotel especially after i had read a kind of negative review the hotel was clean the staff was excellent and extremely helpful this was my first time traveling alone and i never felt safer the room was more than i could have imagined and it was hard to leave it felt like home away from home i look forward to my next trip to washington dc and especially my next stay at the aka white house the only negative would be is that they dont clean your tub every day if you are not staying longer than 7 days,5.0
one and done with this or any starwood property,we arrived christmas eve and stayed through new years day  rooms were deluxe which only means higher floor  not deluxe in any other way shape or form location is the only thing going for this property rude staff ridiculous charges escalators always broken not enough outlets hair dryer didnt work housekeeping was half way done etc etc etc we had 2 rooms one king for my husband and myself and one double for our 3 children 16 18 22 what is with the door in the bathroom zero privacy and it doesnt even work properly double rooms are not big enough to move around in downright claustrophobic the fiasco that was new years eve is a whole different story too  hotel said we could only use entrance on 43rd to get back in after midnight yet the police had 43rd entrance blocked so we walked to 42nd where we were crushed and waited another 40 minutes in the cold only to find out the doors on 42nd were locked unbelievable the people who rated this place high or recommended it obviously have low expectations,2.0
very very nice hotel first rate all the way,the rooms are amazingly beautiful cozy elaborately decorated and tastefully appointed in a contemporarymodern design i am not easily impressed but this was as nice as any hotel ive been to in recent memory and i was indeed impressed the bathroom was elegant spacious and very well lit the room had many options for lighting from business bright to mood casual my room was exceptionally clean and in like new condition the bed was very comfortable with real downfeather pillows which i prefer overall i just can not say enough good things about this hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful as well i stayed for business so i can not actually recall what it cost because i just expensed it but i dont think it was extraordinarily expensive if i recall correctly two thumbs up big for this hotel go there you wont be disappointed,5.0
great service  fair property,excellent front desk service clean but  a little scary best rate i could find near the galleria but i was not comfortable with the location and did not feel 100 safe i would not recommend to a friend so i cant reccomend to you pay a little more and stay at another proprty nearby,3.0
cant go wrong here if you just need a place to crash,"i have frequently visited austin every few months for the last decade i will typically stay a friday or saturday night so i am not in my hotel room often i have stayed at just about every hotel in austin and believe it or not this is my favorite one 
if you are familiar with austin and know all the roads like the back of your hand this location is easily accessible if this is your first time you may feel out of the way
the room was clean comfortable and had modern amenities that i never expected a budget motel to have i liked the nice personal touches they added you could rent free dvds in the lobby they put out dailynightly snacks in the lobby the pillow menu and the basket of goodies they have waiting in your room for you upon arrival it reminded me of the holiday inn express with more of a boutique feel
the staff was over the top wonderful i wish i could remember the name of the young lady that was working the lobby during my stay she was fantastic very sweet girl
i felt safe and comfortable during my stay and would highly recommend this hotel to others if you are looking for a cheap place to crash for a night",5.0
charming and annoying,its tne second time ive stayed here i like the funkiness of the person operated elevatorsand the friendly professional staff but this time am so annoyed over the nonworking wired connection and the fake promises to address my complaints about a lesser room when ive brought colleagues and booked several rooms here for several nights no ice machine they bring you ice no wireless you call an 800 number for technical assistance on a wired connection and are very polite about their limits on addressing that sorry maam the pool is closed for the season all with a very friendly charming face but not meeting my needs for comfort and amenities,3.0
memorable sf honeymoon,my new husband and i went to sf on our honeymoon and hotel carlton was the icing on our cake from the moment we arrived it felt like home the staff is really cool the whole ambiance was welcoming and relaxing the wifi was down for our entire stay is our only complaintbut hey it was our honeymoon we didnt care theres a cute little place next door with really yummy sangria the location was super central and we saved a lot of money,4.0
use the valet at your own risk,our 1 night stay at the hotel was fine however the valet parked our rental car on the street and the car was ticketed by the dc police the hotel manager was quite apologetic and offered to pay the ticket and waive the valet services well it seems he forgot to waive the valet services as we were still charged them to make matters worse it seems there was another ticket on the rental car  we found out about this ticket 2 months after our stay after our rental car company slapped us with a hefty bill i am trying to get this all refunded but getting in touch w the billing dept or any staff in an easy timely manner is difficult disappointed frustrated our one night at this hotel has left us with a headache,2.0
pretty good after a long flight,"we called the hotel from the airport and the shuttle arrived in a matter of minutes the driver was very helpful and insisted on taking the cases on and off the bus
he had us at the hotel a few minutes later where check in was quick and easy our one bedroomed suite was spacious with all the things you needed ie fridge water microwave etc my only comment was the fact that it was beginning to look a bit well used
the hotel was running a special promotion that mean all hilton honours cardholders received free wireless which was great albeit it was a bit flaky and sometimes dropped out or refused o connect for no good reason
we ate in the restaurant downstairs which is a bit soulless as it is in the huge atrium area but the service was good and the food was fine breakfast is also here in the morning and the range and choice was excellent with even a mad to order omelette station
staff were all friendly and helpful and the shuttle the next morning was morethan happy to drop us at the alamo lot to collect our hire car the location of the hotel is a little offputting in that its amongst all the car hire depots and in a pretty seedy area but it could hardly be closer to the airport and the shuttles take you to anywhere you require the ac unit can be noisy but turning the fan to low both kept the noise down to an acceptable level and kept the room cool a little noise is always handy anyway to phase out external noise from the corridors although we found the hotel to be very quiet and peaceful even though there were quite a few guests judging by the number who came down at breakfast time
wed certainly stay here again",4.0
excellent staff clean  always a yummy cookie,"i recently stayed at this doubletree for a workshop and i was very pleased with the overall attentiveness of the staff my experience was that they worked as a team it was refreshing to checkin to this hotel after midnight and be treated like family was welcoming me home
aside from the staff the accommodations were sufficient and comfortable my room was always very clean and toiletries were supplied abundantly 
the drawbacks for me were that the food in the restaurant was okay for the price and the walls were a little thin
however with the endless supply of warm yummy cookies i could almost overlook those things lol ",4.0
modern hotel concept good parking rates comfy stay,"we knew it was going to be a different experience when we pulled up to the curb by a building that looked like an apartment building the hotel seems brand new with what i would describe as a stark modern and minimal interior we were planning on parking on a nearby overnight lot for the weekend but changed our minds when we found out that underground parking with unlimited in and out priviledges is only 15night 
the rooms are oddly numbered with evens on one side and odds on the other our room ending in 20 did not follow the posted signs and we found out by walking the entire floor it was an end unit room very spacious with two queen beds corner sofa sink area and very small bathroom the bathroom was so small that opening the door was impossible if you were standing in front of the toilet 
everything was quite clean and it was a very pleasant stay",4.0
average hotel nothing had but nothing extraordinary,location was mediocre pool was decent as was spa nice fitness room rooms were average sized was stuck with two double beds as no kings were available probably expect more from a hilton overall,3.0
very clean small cozy family run and friendly,we didnt actually stay here but the sign said come in and see a room so we did alan the owner showed us around a couple of room they are small but extremely clean and functional and have sitting areas outside the room there is also a breakfast area with free breakfast tables chairs and umbrellas the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming even though it wouldnt fit our needs due to our grandchildrens need for a pool which they dont have but for a place to lay your head gaze at the harbor walk to restaurants with public transportation very close this is a great place we value personality and service and this exceeds the big boys,4.0
a great beach getaway,my husbands family first introduced me to the beach cottages about 20 years ago when i first started dating him they always booked an entire month we usually stayed with them for a week we stayed in a cottage 3 back from the beach the cottage is was large enough to sleep 4 people very comfortably and it is just steps from the beach the cottages are decorated very nicely and the staff are very accomodating we slept with the windows wide open so that we could hear the ocean waves very relaxing there are plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance and there are plenty of little shops for those who are like me and need a souvenir from every place that i stay another perk is that the crystal pier is right down the boardwalk the cottages have kitchenettes with a small set of dinnerware and silverware so you can bring food and prepare it there there are also barbeques as well it is a family friendly place with ping pong tables for the kids if you want to be close to the beach with all the comforts of home the beach cottages is the place to be,5.0
good location but many flaws for the price,stayed here 3days for meeting with wife excellent location next to grand central station and short walk to theatre district but so many little flaws that just shouldnt be in such a prestigious hotel name big city and for 300night here they are kingbed room too small for 2 people no coffee pot in room no stands to place luggage uncomfortable room temp and thermostat really didnt work tv channels only analog no wifi only 1 sink in bathroom basin small and not enough space for 2 people to keep their toiletries shelf over sink where you could hit your head if you bend over to wash your face alarm clock woke us at 2am we didnt set it i would only stay here again if i could get a larger room for a much lower price,3.0
river inn a great value for a suite,i took my family on a last minute trip to dc in january and we got a great deal at the river inn we spent 9900 online and got a very nice room with private changing area and full kitchen if youre looking to spend your money on a nicer room then the comfort inn type this was great for a weekend i think a week long visit would need a bigger room then the jr suite the doorman gave us great directions and tips on where to go with kids and without this was by far one of the least expensive trips weve taken in a long time thank you river inn,4.0
do you want to be treated like royalty,"from the doorman to the management you will be addressed by name and your preferences remembered the staff is professional and friendly all request are granted with a smile and in the blink of an eye i asked for an ottoman at the desk and upon our arrival in the room it was in place anything you need is available 247 i had to place an urgent call at 400am no problem room service appeared within ten minutes
the location is fabulous the financial district is not infested with tourists as is union square and oh so much safer its an ideal central location to begin and end your daily adventures and falling asleep to the cable cars below is heavenly
bobs steak  chop house is a treat sit near a window and watch the world go by
look for deals on the net you dont have to pay top dollar for this exquisite hotel but it is worth it
you will always remember your stay at the omni san francisco with great fondness",5.0
great service,got a great conference rate arrived four hours early and checked straight into my room clean and spacious only issue from my perspective being poor door soundproofing with huge gaps around it allowing corridoor noise to enter the room late checkout was easily arranged and the bellhop arranged for limo transfer to bwi for a good rate the limo arrived on time and made for a more pleasant experience then a cab,4.0
great hotel great location,just returned from a trip to ny stayed at the jolly after reading reviews before we went i was a bit worried about what we were letting ourselves in for but was a great hotel very friendly staff fantastic location i would recommend this hotel to anybody only one thing to be careful ofcheck your bill as they tried to charge for using the mini bar in the room but after speaking to reception and stating we had not used anything they apoligised and credited our account but overall the hotel was great and the staff more than helpful would i go again yes,5.0
typical swanky w hotel loved the vibe but zero att service not good,"this hotel offers everything a w would offer but probably wont find a hotel with such an electric atmosphere and vibe probably one of the best locations in all of nyc the living room lobby is happening w locals celebrities and chic tourists the place is see and be seen the staff is all good looking young and nice
one major drawback no cell service with atts iphone at all had to connect with friends in city it cost me 85 to leave 5 voicemails thru w phone i definitely complained there excuse is everyone in nyc has the iphone therefor clogging the airways the front desk lady was nice and reduced bill by 50 as a platinum member i thought more should have been taken off
the hotel lobby drinks  great
blue fin was soso food was just ok i had a better tuna burger in dc 
rooms great overall definitely recommend thid hotel for location and vibe but if you have an iphone good luck",4.0
wonderful place to host a business meeting,to all the event planners and conference planners out therethis property is as close to perfect as you can get but be sure to negotiate free water in the rooms  free internet in sleeping rooms and meeting spaces the food is wonderful the staff is top notch and property is convenient to get to and beautiful,5.0
rip off and dont stay there,i booked this thru living social vacations and what a mistake the folks were very unhelpful and they hide additional charges till after the fact the service was rotten the people unfriendly and way to many solicitations for purchases of time share when you are having a rotten time the rooms are barely adequate based on the descriptions and they didnt let us check in before 4pm though the no view room we stayed in had message lights from 2 days before somehow i think they just didnt want to be bothered you are much better off with a hotel than this place,1.0
saved the trip,want to mention that this hotel saved our trip we originally were staying at a hotel on geary street and were very turned off about the place we prepaid for 4 nights and it was so bad we went to priceline and were able to secure the tuscan for the other 3 days the tuscan is centrally located at the wharf and its a great placethe beds are great several good pillows and the rooms are superthe lobby is nicerestaurants and shops are close by as wellit saved our trip,5.0
kind of scary,this hotel is exactly what it is billed to be  a two star hotel i dont stay in two star hotels but the great reviews here led me to try it plus the close proximity to columbia not quite sure why there are all these great reviews for a little more  one can stay in a much nicer hotel in a safer area i stayed for one night for a quick visit to columbia with my teenage sons and would not return we had two rooms one was billed as a suite really tiny the hotel is very old the decor is really old the rooms are small and dark the air conditioner which is attached to the window and old made so much noise it was difficult to sleep the view out of the windows is into a dark alley and an ugly buidling next door i will say that the rooms are clean and the staff was nice the bathrooms have been updated however i felt uncomfortable and unsafe during my stay it has a very seedy feel to it i saw one of the staff very thoroughly check out my as yet undeveloped 13 year old daughter if you have young girls in your party beware yuk,1.0
not sure about this one,"i use tripadvisor for every trip i go on and theres certain things i look at
1 location right in the center of it all a great location
2 parking 25 a night
3 pros i disagree with people about the service the people at the front desk were very nice and helpful the only thing is the cons below
4 cons we got there and the room was freezingwe were awoken our first night to doors banging open and closed and had to tell the housekeeper to please not slam the doors they were very sweet though and didnt realize how loud it was so the noise stopped then the second night apparently there were two friends staying to the right and left of us and kept visiting each other all night up until 300 am until finally we couldnt take it and had to have our room changed they were very accomodating
i thought the people who worked there were very nice but the huge problem is the walls are paper thin and just a very loud and un peaceful stay
there is a great italian place on the same side about a block down thats worth going to",1.0
central well appointed good value,"seven minute walk from powell bartmuni station
nice rooms with uptodate furniture
comfortable bed
friendly but not all together efficient staff we waited a day and a half for a wire to connect our ipod to the stereo and one morning we woke up with no coffee
close to lots of excellent shopping and restaurants",4.0
great westin,spent a weekend at the book cadilac for the detroit marathon great location new hotel in old restored building great value and service westin did a great job witt this one definetly the hotel to stay at when in downtown detroit,5.0
missing the little extras,"we stayed here for three nights up until christmas the hotel is nice and the room was a reasonable size especially given the great rate that we got and better than their own web site
the reason that this only gets three stars is the feeling that recouping money is their number one aim rather than pleasing the customer the room is advertised with a coffee maker but they neglect to tell you that the only coffee is from that minibar and you can guess the prices there were no bath robes and there is a charge for high speed internet which hasnt been the case in a lot of other hotels
the most frustrating thing was checkout we had been moved rooms after the first night and i was told that the hotel wasnt terribly full 
however later on when i asked for a late checkout as we were moving to a different hotel on christmas day i was told that the checkout was 1200 and the absolute latest we could go was 1230 without incurring an extra half day charge happy holidays to you too 
all in all the experience was ok but could have been so much better if you felt that they werent trying to make an extra dollar at every turn",3.0
is this a 312star hotel feels like a 4star,"i was in a time crunch having to find a good manhattan hotel my father and myself only 3 days in advance prices started at just below 200night and some hotels in this price range were 2star enter wyndham fashion 26 rated by hotwire to be 312 stars  the best rating within the price range
the stay did not disappoint located in the heart of manhattan garment district to be precise the hotel is sparkling clean with welldesigned lobby and restaurant it offers amenities id seen before only in 4star hotels such as bathrobes and heavenly beds i mean it literally not as a trademark the staff is cheerful and upbeat the room was wellappointed if a bit on the smaller side the price to pay for my 4star experience just over 200night we stayed 4 nights and the price i mentioned includes all taxes
i was told at the reception that the hotel was brand new grand opening 3 weeks ago excellent value and i hope the management keeps it up",5.0
location vs service,"location was fantastic within walking distance to many downtown attractions the hotel was very clean and comfortable  as i have found most westins to be the only issue was the service there was usually only one person on duty at the front desk that obviously was equipped for 34 this meant that there was always a line to ask a question or request something also the room cleaning service never replaced fresh towels or soaps when we asked the nice lady in the hallway about more towels she said she was out strange
also really hated that you had to use your hotel room key to use the elevator it may have been an extra layer of security but proved to be annoying",3.0
an experience in itself,for those who are looking to visit new york city for a day or two this hotel cannot be beat there are many things that make the marriott marquis the greatest hotel in times square but the 1 by far is the location it is located directly in the dead center of times square making basically everything in short walking distance the hotel features an incredibly convenient and smart elevator system which makes getting to your room in a hotel with an incredible number of rooms an easy process on the main floor area there is a very lovely sushi restaurant and a complete bar area with a wide range of exotic drinks and a glasswall intimatetableseating area that directly overlooks times square giving you a view of the nightlife while chatting with friends all rooms also overlook times square so a great view is never too far away from you for those of you who are musical theater enthusiasts the hotel offers a ticket booth where you can inquire about showtimes locations even buy tickets right there at the hotel though with a rather high service charge also the marquis plays host to the drowsy chaperone itself service was excellent we requested a rollaway bed for our room which was promptly delivered and the staff was always ready to answer any questions we had parking was valet and convenient in every way the hotel also offers a huge exercise facility but we didnt get the opportunity to use it i should mention that this hotel is a great idea for a shortterm trip since the rooms are quite expensive for a longer stay in new york i imagine there are more affordable locations but for a shortterm amazing experience the marquis isnt just a place to stay it will become a memorable part of your experience altogether i recently visited nyc again and even though i didnt stay at the marquis i still went there just for the bar and restaurant,5.0
wish i couldve stayed longer,stayed here during a onenight business trip and i was quite happy i arrived at noon and was able to check in which was nice my room was clean and nicely decorated with a king bed and a small couch the bathroom was clean and of a decent size with a curved shower curtain rod and citrusylavender toiletries take note of the sign saying theyll only restock toiletries and towels on request my room was fairly quiet though as with most hotels i heard some hallway noise room service was expensive 1218 plus tipdelivery feetax for most breakfast entrees  to be expected for a big city hotel every hotel employee i encountered was very friendly although the woman who checked me in was super fast which some people might not like,5.0
food and service quality provided tremendous value,"my stay at the brookhollow sheraton was unintentional but ive been extremely impressed with the food and service quality especially at such an affordable price ive run the gamut of hotels and while the rooms could have used very minor touchups i didnt care because the staff and food quality more than made up for it 
special thanks to the cimarron staff for making my time here without my family with whom im never separated easier and even pleasurable
thanks again

a haven in the city,"this hotel is absolutely perfect in its own class its got great service friendly staff clean rooms and both my wife and i are difficult to please and the rooms look nice at that
the extras like the complementary bottled water and breakfast are great add ons to help you start your day in the city
i was worried by the noise at first but being up on the 15th floor at street side this has not been a problem as of yet and we have had great full nights of sleep the long days and the great bed might have helped 
the bed by the way is the kind you wish you could take home on a plane bit big for carry on though
whether its business or pleasure this hotel is one i would definitely recommend to everyone",5.0
great location for visiting colleges in boston,i got a great price that included valet parking with the drive in to boston and save promotion i was bringing 3 teenage girls to visit colleges in boston and booked a deluxe room the mbta green line is almost right outside the hotel entrance and will quickly bring you to most of the colleges in boston the room was a good size and comfortable for the four of us the bonus was that there were two bathrooms which was key to getting the girls out of the room in a reasonable amount of time the beds two doubles were very comfortable and we were happy with the room the water pressure in the shower could have been better and wifi cost over 12 per device per day which i thought was a bit excessive so we chose not to use it the staff were very accommodating and immediately resolved the minor problems we had we ate dinner at the melting pot located in the hotel while it was pricey we had a lot of fun and really enjoyed it i totally recommend this hotel as a great central location for college visits in the city of boston,4.0
great location,weve stayed here for only two days on our californian vacation we booked petit room but got upgraded to bigger one room was fine thou bed was quite small and we are not big people room was clean but it smelled a bit weird and that was only down side to it staff was very friendly and location was great our room was facing other rooms but we didnt care and it was quiet which was the benefit,3.0
nothing works,i normally wouldnt write a review about a hotel i spent such little time in but this is outrageous the check in was fast and easy but thats the only good thing the tv doesnt allow you to watch movies or tv the phone has the bottons to allow you to connect to room service ect but none of the bottons work the tv and thermostat are both from 15 years ago and most of the people i called to fix these issues either didnt give a crap or were totally clueless as what to do the hotel is so cheap the rooms dont have mini bars i highly recommend you never stay at this hotel,2.0
great stay at georgetown suites,my daughter and i spent two nights at the georgetown suites during a college visit august 1113 we had a studio suite 125 a night the hotel was very nice and the location was very central just off of busy m street nw on 30th despite its proximity to the shopping district the hotel was very quiet georgetown u was a short cab ride away and we walked to george washington u the suite was complete with a full kitchenbig refrigerator microwave sink stovetop cabinets i cant remember if there was an oven the bed and pillow were very comfortablei did not even have to use the pillow i travel with there were many closets and a dresser and desk the hotel features bath and bodyworks shampoo etcalways a plus for me breakfast included cereal fruit yogurt cereal bars poptarts toast good bagels pastries muffins coffee tea etc i was very happy with the rate although i will warn that there is a parking fee of 18 per day you do have unlimited inout privileges also note that the ceilings were lowi am not sure an suv could fit in there check with the hotel we stayed at the 30th street location having read on tripadvisor that it was preferred it has a nice courtyard off of 30th street that was pretty with landscaping recommendation for dinner is bangkok joes asian cuisine very tasty and upscale but not too pricey great location at 3000 k street nw walking distance from the hotel and in the fun washington harbor area shops dining people watching harbor walk m street has lots of shops and restaurants too all in all a great hotel in a great location,5.0
when i came true the doorand i met the guy at the front desk his attitude was badhe did explain anything to me  he ask for my,when i got up to the room 1902they advertised it as nonsmokingand open the door i could smell that someone was smoking in the roomand this is very important there is a small refrigerator in the room pack with all sorts of drink and snacks in the draws  do not eat or drink unless you are will to pay 900 bucks for a beer and 600 for chipsthe menu was in the drew covered with snacks so becarefuland there is no internet in the room if you want internet guess what yep you have to pay 1200 a daylocation was awesome,1.0
best inexpensive hotel in nyc,i stayed at the ramada eastside inn for 2 weekend nights when i was in nyc to visit some friends for the price its hard to find a better place i travel to nyc several times a year and have stayed a many different hotels i booked through priceline and paid 125 a night the hotel is clean modern and the staff was friendly yes the rooms are small but this is nyc   space is at a premium the rooms had flat screen tvs comfortable beds private baths etc i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice inexpensive hotel option in nyc,4.0
great stay,spent a week in memphis for a convention and stayed at the peabody overall this is a very regal hotel i wouldnt however classify it as 5star pros customer service is exceptional from the guys at valet parking concierge front desk  all terrific and very quick to handle any problem the rooms are old classic in decor but bright airy and very clean and comfortable unlike other historic hotels the peabody doesnt have that spooky or haunted atmosphere the lobby gives you the impression of old school hollywood where the powerbrokers met to drink bourbon and make deals the bathrooms are of nice size and also very classicaly decorated  walk in closet is a huge plus the beds are among the most comfortable ive ever slept in i didnt use room service but if the number of plates left outside doors are an indicator its probably very good the ducks are a treat crowds gather about 3040 minutes from showtime and get ready for momentary blindness given all the flash bulbs going off during their trek down the red carpet the restaurants are very good in service taste and presentation i did not use the pool fitness center or business center cons valet parking at 21 per day is insane there are other parking garages several blocks away but can be a bear if you have tons of luggage ive also heard others complain about not having a coffee maker in each room  they have a coffee setup in the main lobby that allows you to see those with hangovers hobble to get their java starbucks is across the main entrance into an adjacent shopping center i was surprised to hear the live music coming from a few blocks away  at 10pm overall i thouroughly enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay again,4.0
disappointed that this hotel failed to live up to brand expectations,beautiful lobby bellmen never held doors or offered luggage assistance wireless internet doesnt work unless close to the elevator pool listed as an amenity is offsite so very inconvenient and additional charge despite premium nightly ratesroom quality varied greatly in size layout and view large by ny standards but small for any other city ive visited paid a premium for quality that wasnt delivered not all rooms have fabulous views onsite menu options extremely limited for longer stays although exceptional quality some staff exceptionally accommodating while others were rudelate checkout request accommodated and location walking distance to millenium park was a nice benefit,3.0
visit was too short,"i accompanied my husband who was attending a 2day conference while he was occupied i had a little time to explore the lazy river pool system was fantastic clean and pleasantly landscaped i wandered around until i found a private spot and vegged i also took the nature trail twice it includes a handicap friendly circuit training course also visited the exercise room rows of wellmaintained equipment 
the general store has a large selection of food and sundries and is a great alternative if you want to skip dining their chicken salad is made from scratch and was delicious the bar decor made you feel like you were in texas the bar itself was wellstocked the conferences closing dinner was held outdoors under the stars full course meal was expertlyserved
the resort is clean and spacious the staff was gracious my only complaints were that the maps could have been more explanatory as the resort is big and it was easy to get lost and that the pool areas needed a few spray cans of off around for the skeeters that occasionally attacked",5.0
go to the hilton,"no hotel deserves a good rating where the staff doesnt care about the guest when we made the reservation on their web site they have a space for you to make additional comments about any preferences you have while you stay there we specifically stated that it was our sons 13th birthday and all we wanted was a nice view of the city we got a roof top it was laughable at least a response stating that they didnt have such a room would have been an indication that they cared about you
staff was also very rude dont tell me that its too difficult to be nice we knew right away this hotel was not friendly so we canceled our second night and stayed at the 10 times better hilton went down to the bar in the lobby the next morning to grab some quick breakfast and had to remind them 3 times about the hot chocolate i ordered and paid for i even had to stir the powdered drink myself because they were too interested in the next patron couldnt sit down to eat because every table had garbage on it from the last person that sat there nobody cared at all about the cleanliness of the hotel or the service which was almost non existent maybe its because i was an american all staff were foreigners and so were most of the guests too bad if you dont like that comment but thats the way it was not the first experience with that dont support any place that treats you like this place did they will never change otherwise went to the hilton times square and let me tell you it was magnificent we all had a good experience there they couldnt help you enough get with it roosevelt with a beautiful lobby like that it should represent how you treat your guests",1.0
good value for short stay,my wife and i stayed at the holday inn lax for a 6hour lay over in july its always hard to choose a hotel for a short layover because even though wed be asleep most of the time wed rather not stay in a shorttime hotel the holiday inn airport pickup bus sometimes also picks up for the nearby westin hotel or la quinta inn so you have to look long and hard at the words spelled out by lights on the sign on the front of the bus they may change in a moment to say holiday inn checkin was adequate rooms are clean and the service was ok but not energetic for example i asked the man at the reception desk standing in front of a sign saying shuttle buses to the airport leave every 15 minutes on the hour and quarter hour or just whenever the bus arrivesfound out later its the latter were leaving on a southwest airlines domestic flight departing at 7 am whats a good time to leave the hotel answer with tone of finality a bus leaves every 15 minutes we bought food at the ampm in the arco station next door the free wireless is provided by a company that serves more than one hotel and it was so slow at 1 am that we had to use dialup to get our days messages but considering the high price of rooms near the airport we would stay at holiday inn lax again,4.0
comfortable good choice for business,being there on business attending an exec education program comfortable room and meeting facilities breakfast is kinda togo i was expecting something better overall food and beverages are standard below from my expectations but acceptable service is ok front desk team is more attentive than the rest location is good however downtown houston has little to offer,4.0

great place to stay with a car,i stayed 1 night with my 12 yo daughter while stopping over in nyc on our way upstate to visit relatives i was able to park my car onsite for free and get it when needed this hotel is close enough to times square to walk to yet off the beaten track of noise and traffic the uss intrepid museum is just around the corner along with bicycle rentals for central park we were too busy to try out the swimming pool but it sure looked inviting and is a definite plus the staff was very friendly and helpful the travel inn will be the 1st place i check the next time i come to the big apple i wish i couldve stayed longer,5.0
would love to experience the hotel again loved the beds,hope i have the opportunity to enjoy this great hotel again,5.0
clean rooms and friendly staff,i have always been impressed with the quality of customer service and cleanliness of hampton inn this was my first time staying at this location and it was a great first impression the staff was very warm welcoming and helpful the beds were heavenly i look forward to staying there again,5.0
reliable marriott standardsalways,nice hotel great staff very friendly and welcoming rooms nice and clean marriott beds are the bestalways comfortable complimentary  fresh coffee during the day was nice ice water in the lobby kept fresh all day very nice since it was very hot the recent weekend we stayed would stay here again ez access and close to downtown,4.0
not so cheap but it was a hassle free stay,booked three nights all hotels this weekend were very expensive booked this as a last resort good location discrete service and comfortable no issues to speak of its less chintzy than most american hotels but not quite boutique it was a relaxing stay,4.0
great hotel renovated perfect spot on venice beach,"we stayed there for 4 nights in may 2008 after escaping a too expensive and snobby beverly hills inhotel  although the renovation was still going on we were able to stay in a beautiful newly renovated room on the top floor with a spectacular ocean view also you were able to step up to the roof where we had great views to santa monica and la
we also loved the surroundings which was by our feeling not at all dangerous but very colorful and interesting it is close to bars good restaurants and caffees maybe it is not the right hotel for familys but if you want to have a good time and dive into the spirit of venice beache go for it we my girlfriend and me loved it and will definetly return",4.0
good location nice rooms,i stayed at this place when i was taking the bar examination clean and comfortable room it is a great location down by the watertower and right across from the drake it has a pretty good value for being right in the middle of the summer time the place was quiet at night the room service was excellent overall it is a pretty good value for putting you right in the middle of michigan ave,4.0
definitely would return,"it was my first trip to ny and i wanted to stay somewhere in the middle of the action this hotel is perfect for that everything is just a short jaunt away the room was very clean and the hotel staff made aboveaverage effort to accomodate a rollaway cot and gave about 15 towels 3 women the room which were very very appreciated the hotel was very secure the little drawbacks were that the internet is available only mondayfriday during business hours if you needed to do business which i did but didnt want to drag my laptopand the hotel restuaurant for breakfast was less than fabulous however foleys the major restaurant was very very nice for supper and excellent seafood
i would definitely stay again for sure",4.0
pleasantly surprised but would stay here again,upon my arrival monica greeted me very pleasantly and offered to upgrade my room at no additional charge im not sure that i actually got an upgrade from what i had requested to begin with but i must say the room was very nice hard wood floors in the sleeping room marble floors and tile in bathroom cedar lined closet area although i wouldnt say it is actually a closet cedar lined drawers in desk free in room safe which is nice to have i locked my netbook up when i wasnt in the room room was clean and free of any bad smells the whole property is nonsmoking unique pictures on walls of life magazine front pictures from as early as 1913 in my room there isnt much in the way of eating establishments close to the hotel however just over one or two streets are is a wide variety this hotel is convenient if you want to go to macys and the empire state building it also very close to the herald square mta subway stop however for the parade route head way north there is no real good access to see the parade at the macys store youll get a better view of the parade from around central park west its crowded but less crowded than at macys or in other parts of the downtown manhattan area my only minor complaint about my room was that the bathtub drained slowly other than that i would definately consider staying at this hotel again,4.0
great locationgreat staffgreat value,this is a very clean friendly welllocated hotel latasha was extremely patient and kind through many emails as i wanted know all i possibly could about the hotel and the area we used the valet parking at 22 a day with inout privileges its a bargain here or any other big city and we were treated wonderfully which made for an excellent first impression checkin was quick and easy and the desk and bell staff were friendly and professional our room was a twoqueen business class with a microwave refrigerator big closet and very clean and inviting we usually do not have housekeeping done when we stay for an extended period of time except for fresh towels but this days inn insists on cleaning the room after three days which we thought was an indication of its dedication to cleanliness the free continental breakfast was fine no eggs or meat just pastries bagels juice and coffee and the breakfast area was pleasant most of all we really appreciated the location and the helpfulness of the staff we normally stay at marriott properties and have been unimpressed with other days inns but we recommend the days inn chicago it is in a lovely building in a great neighborhood with a wonderful staff we did get what we thought was a good deal by booking in advance,5.0
great location and service but be prepared to see pompous or pretentious guests,overall the hotel was wonderful with great service however if you walked in with jeans and a t shirt be prepared to feel completely out of place due to other guests the room was great and the bathroom included a separate over head shower and jacuzzi tub it is only a 5 minute walk from 16th street mall and 10 min walk to lodo and coors stadium also be prepared for a 29 valet parking fee public parking overnight in the area is just as much,4.0
historical hotel not a cookie cutter chain,"my husband and i spent this past weekend at the menger to celebrate a special anniversary the tone was set when i made my reservation with the lovely correspondence from rose gonzalez who went above and beyond to insure that our stay was indeed special in this day and age of impersonal computer generated replies when booking roomshow refreshing that someone actually wanted to do everything possible to make sure we had a wonderful visit 
this personal treatment continued throughout our stay from the front desk to the valet parking staff everyone we encountered seemed to take personal pride in the history and charm of the famous menger hotel every staff member was more than willing to share stories of the history of the menger with us and their pride in the hotel was obvious and well deserved
the hotel itself is like taking a step back in time you are literally in spitting distance of the alamo every opportunity we had was spent wandering the hotel  the lobby the landscaped courtyard poolside the various nooks and cranniesand everywhere had reminders of the wonderful history of this hotel there are old photos cases with memorabilia and antiques throughout the first floor so its almost a museum in itself to stroll where oscar wilde once sipped margaritas and to sit in the bar teddy roosevelt slammed a few whiskeys and recruited his rough riders was a real treat we were just close enough to the river walk to enjoy all of its amenities without all of the noise and late night revelry a nice bonus was that the trolley stop in front of the alamo made it a breeze to get around the main sights of the city 
 our room was charming and in keeping with the style of the hotel we were right next to the beautiful wrought iron balcony with the stain glass skylight over the victorian lobby the room style was in keeping with the age of the hotel over 100 yrs furnished with victorian furniture our bed could not have been more comfortable it was in every way exactly what i hoped for before we departed we enjoyed sunday brunch in the hotels colonial dining room with its beautiful buffet and a complimentary mimosa
if you are looking for a shiny sparkly lobby flat screen tvs granite bathrooms with sleek furnishings fast elevators and stairs that dont squeak try any of the many chain hotels in the area but if you want to be reminded of the history of san antonio at every turn and a time when life was a bit more gracious and moved at a slower pace and if you are able to embrace the quirks of a gracious old hotel then stay at the menger 
even if you don t stay here come by after your visit to the alamo for some of the famous mango ice cream and to take pictures of a beautiful hotel that time forgot",5.0
location but not much else,"i stayed at the hotel in july 2005 agree with previous posters about quality of the hotel 
the lobby is nice but the rooms need a facelift nothing particularly wrong  its just that everything looks tired and dated beds arent particularly comfortable the vanity area was in the bedroom my shower only had one temperature  extremely hot the bathroom is too small for more than one person at a time the air conditioner works well but is consistently noisy 
when i arrived i was given a room directly opposite the ice maker when i complained amazingly they had other rooms available i dont understand why youd put someone in such a room when others were available
room service was prompt and food was tasty didnt try any of the restaurants 
they have hispeed internet accessunlimited us long distance calls for 10 per day 
i heard numerous complaints about parking expensive and no inout privileges on the plus side the hotel is directly adjacent the medical complex and the light rail so you should be able to walkride to many activities
bottom line  its fine for one night if you plan to stay awhile id look elsewhere",2.0
nice city hotel,we went into philadelphia and we tried the sofitel since i have stayed at the sofitel in chicago before and had a good experience the rate was reasonable and the location was nice there was some work being done in the lobby which made checkin inconvenient room was very nice,4.0
really cool luxurious and awesome staff,"my fiance and i stayed here for the weekend last month while visiting family we got a rate that was very reasonable for their basic room and it did not dissapoint 
the room was plenty big very well appointed had a nice view of charles river the minibar is awesome granted we couldnt afford to eat anything in it but the quality of items were a reflection of how well they do things at the liberty
the bed was really comfy the bathroom was huge and has a shower and bathtub overall the quality of the room was 5 star 
we used the gym everyday nothing special a few treadmills free weights and an allinone machine but got the job done
what really sets this hotel apart is the staff they were all extremely welcoming helpful and courteous and you can tell they have been very well trained from the door and bell staff the desk agents to our housekeeper everyone was always making sure we were enjoying our stay and wanted to make it better if they could 
we also used the free bikes they have available a really cool option to ride along the river
this will be our goto place when we visit boston",5.0
great location for firsttime visit,really enjoyed our stay here walking distance to major attractions and easy to get onoff the subway rooms are immaculate and generously sized though decor is a little dated only caution is no wifi and its expensive to buy access would absolutely stay here again,4.0
great for a stop over,"the radisson is probably best if you are just stopping over in la for a night or two its about a 5 min walk to the public bus which can take you anywhere the trolley bus that takes you to manhattan beach for usd5 is well worth the trip
rooms are comfy and staff are very quick to rectify any problems",4.0
unparalleled boston location comfortable and not a chain,the copley square hotel is a lovely mediumsized hotel in an unparalleled location and you are paying in part for the locationits not inexpensive its comfortable bordering on luxurious i stayed in the smallest room which wasnt actually all that small and which  although it was supposed to have an interior view  in fact looked out over the street friendly service appealing lobby and hallways flatscreen tv with betterthanusual selection of cable channels nice bath no tub in my room which was fine and free wifi throughout from here you can walk up and down newbury street and get the subway anywhere its a nice place to come home to after a full day of work or play,5.0
great location,"the room was nicely appointed but i would have liked to see a small refirigerator and an ipod docking station the room was very clean which is the most important thing to me when i travel however the room was very stuffy as if the thermostat wasnt working we had a very noisy neighbor but as soon as we called the front desk security was dispatched and the neighbors behaved 
overall i reccomend this hotel even above others that i have stayed at in the vicinity the staff were great the room was clean and they allwed us to bring our dog the location couldnt be better right next door to the convention center and a block or so away from the paramount theatre and malls",4.0
good location,my husband and i just returned today from a four day vacation in washington what a great city stayed at the residence inn i must say i was pleasantly surprised by this hotel it was clean and the staff were friendly and reasonably helpful the room was large we had a studio suite which had a full kitchen and sitting room we didnt really use the kitchen as we were out so much but it was nice to have the refrigeratoretc the bed was comfy with lots of pillows the bathroom was ok and with no shortage of towels the ac  heating system was noisy and we had to turn the fan off in order to sleep it was a definite plus having the complimentary breakfast each morning it was quite good and with more variety than i expected the staff in the am were fantastic the complimentary dinnersocial was ok served montueswed again more food and variety than i expectednot gourmet for sure but ok and great for families the hotel was close to the metro which was great but had no restaurants or pubs nearby which was a definite negative it would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel able to walk to most attractions hot tub was nicedidnt use the pool we had an issue with the fee at the hotel i booked online at the washingtonorg website i thought that i was booking directly thru the marroitt however apparently it was thru a third party i was given a price when i booked and then another price from the hotel the price from the hotel was lower i called the hotel twice from canada and was told both times that the lower price was what i would pay not the case i called the 3rd party and was told by them that they would call the hotel to talk with the manager to straightened the price out when we arrived at the hotel i tried to explain the situation to the manager but felt that he totally dismissed us with very little conversation at all he barely listened to us and walked away while i was talking to him not a very nice welcome to the hotel when i mentioned marriott rewards he waved his hand and mumbled something about no marriott rewards with this type of booking not sure what that was all about despite the unpleasant experience that we had with the manager we enjoyed the hotel however im not sure that i would stay there again because of that,4.0
for the money you cant beat this,i booked a room at this hotel over a month a go 2 weeks before the trip i noticed a special price on their website i requested a change on my reservation to reflect the now lower price it was done in less then 24 hours at that price i even added a second night to my tripso glad i did asked for a high floorquiet roomgot floor 6  out of 8  and a room with an other room on only one side  very quiet  so far everything looked good got in the room  boutique queen  small but not too small deco reflected the boutique theme very nice my girlfriend loved everything about it clean smelled fresh window opens  love to hear the beat of the city  is it a 5 starno but everything about it was great  check in  2 minutes check out  1 minutes  staff was pleasant i will go back to boston at this particular hotel you are 15 minutes walk to prudential center  shopping mall  to chinatown you are 20 minutes walk to boston common and theater district you are 25 minutes walk to fenway park loved everything about it cant wait to go back  only complaint even on the 6th floor we could hear the street noise and people talking lound on street level from the window  it did close well but you could hear the outside easily ,4.0
great value for the money,we stayed 2 adults and 2 children at hotel milburn for 3 nights the location was perfect  near central park natural museum of history and only a few blocks from the subway  red line  leading us to all kind of interesting places downtown the continental breakfast was very fine and the hotel in general was really good we give hotel milburn our best recommendations and we would love to come back and stay at this hotel again,4.0
my new hotel in new york city and yours as well,"it has been a long time since 1965 when on every trip to new york i have stayed at the new york hilton on avenue of the americas last year when staying there i was reminded that the hotel opened in the mid 1960s  a few months ago i tried to get into the hotel and found that rates were nearly 500 per night thanks to the hilton club concept which seems to have cut the available rooms to ordinary folk to about half of the total resulting in twice the price
i took a chance and decided to stay in soho where a pal of mine owns a great jewelry store and found the above sheraton when i checked in the desk staff acted as if i was a long time lost person who had come home for good in a flash i was in my room all new and nice with internet that worked like a charm  i seem to remember a german phrase  mit raazender geschwindekuit or something like that with great speed and a very very nice room for a very very good price best of all elevators that got you to your room on floor 14 with even more speed than ever in a hotel in new york no waiting
once i checked in i found the staff eager to help me get around the city and where to walk to all kinds of flower shops my pals store and every imaginable kind of cool stores are available plus something you will never see in mid town nice little bakeries pizza places and restaurants of every type 
the rooms like many at any four points sheraton are modern design and not the traditional heavy woodsand massive chairs but very very comfortable and well appointed there was even a power strip for those of us who think we are to be in touch with 2 phones two laptops and of course an ipod so for the first time in years my own power strip was deployed to remain in the suitcase 
in walking around i was able to visit my pals store in soho visit art galleries and frankly enjoy myself despite having heavy duty finance meetings ever day over 4 days my worst fear not being able to get a cab or being forced to use the subway a lot were never realised despite it being a small hotel at least by gotham city standards there was always a cab waiting out front also the cab fare to laguardia was about 10 bucks less than the trip to midtown 
now it turns out that soho is considered a new emerging area for tech companies lofts and young people if you want to enjoy the city of new york consider staying here its my new home",5.0
could have been better,"the suites at the wharf is on a good location especially for moving around the town it is just up the hill from the trolley that takes you to union square so the location cant be beat
i had a one bedroom suite on the second floor that overlooked the neighbors home that was being painted so there was a strong odor of something when i complained to the front desk about the odor they suggested they could spray aerosol spray to cover the smell having asthma i didnt take this option the manager came up to the room and try to explain hotels had a tendency to have odors that were unpleasant we went out and figured we would air the room out however the home next to the suites was being painted because of the odor i landed up have some issues the hotel doctor is very nice he is expensive but nice
i asked for a room change but was told the hotel was full but i can call back at midnight and talk to the night manager i called to request a room change and was given the option of a room directly next to the one i was in or one across the hall i took the room across the hall because it didnt have an odor my niece and i went out for the day and came back in midafternoon and the same odor was in the room again when i called down to the desk the only thing they could say is that this is the odor of the hotel 
all in the staff hotel was not very helpful with the odor on my last day there i found out that the hotel was painting rooms on the 3rd floor so the odor may not be there all the time
the other issue is that the hotel does not have a concierge there all the time to assist with your plans or day trips they have strange hours for days 9am11am and nights 6pm8pm the kicker was that they called my hotel room 3 days after i checked in asking me if i wanted my welcome kit welcome kit is nothing special it was the materials that i picked up at visitors center
dont use the room service the food isnt worth it you can find great restaurants down on the wharf or surrounding areas also plan to eat early and go to the grocery store and get snacks or drinks there are no vending machines in the hotel san francisco seems to close down earlier in the winter than in the spring and summer 
dont take the suggestion for the nail salon in the book there is a nicer and cheaper one on beach st the one they suggest is in the point center stripe mall it is the size of walk in closet and shabby 
highly recommend the trip to alcatraz at night the tours are more organized and interactive than the day trip and there are less people on the island so you can explore it a little more 
highly recommend the muni pass its 5 one way on the trolley and 150 for the bus one way the pass is well worth the cost also dont get on the bus in the am before students arrive at school or workers go to work hard to get on and off where you need same goes for after school",2.0
a surprise  will stay again,"located very close to the airport and a big shopping mall we drove there so i am not sure about public transportation around the lodge it is abit off the main road 
the lobby looked really nice and so did the room very secured every time you want to enter a certain building you would need to scan you room key the room wasnt big but good enough i have to mention the lobby in each building they have complimentary dvd for you to watch free chocolates yogurts water cheese sticks fruits chips and haagendaz icecream different flavours they also have a huge fridge and a microwave which we managed to use we had leftovers from dinner gym was wellequipped and very clean 
i have to say i wasnt very happy with the breakfast we did have a late checkout but i woke up just for the breakfast and have wished i didnt 
but overall a very good place to stay",4.0
would return in a second,we stayed at the nob hill motor inn for 8 days and were very pleased with the accommodation and services and the location we were in room 224 on the top floor  the northeast corner  and found it comfortable spacious and quiet we didnt encounter any of the mould issues reported in other reviews nor were we troubled by noise from the street or elsewhere in the property the bed was comfortable the daily cleaning thoroughly adequate if not stellar there were cobwebs in a couple corners of the room but the bathroom was spotless every day and the fridge and microwave were very convenient one of the huge strengths of this property note that the signage reads nob hill motel is its location its extremely convenient to van ness avenue and boutitquey polk street and to the california street cable car terminus its situated in a primarily residential area  we felt as though we were living in a neighbourhood rather than hotel row or a business district which was a huge plus and gave us a much better feel for the city we found plenty of nearby places to eat cheaply check out nicks crispy tacos polk  broadway and the crepe house polk  washington no question wed stay here again,5.0
just back loved this hotel will stay here again,we chose this hotel form the tripadisor reviews and it was ideal for us good locationclean nice size roomfridge was a nice bonusfree use of business centernext time were in ny we are going to stay herebig thanks to everyone at this hotel,5.0
overall great experience,aside from the bathroom wall not really being a wall it was a large piece of seethrough canvas which made it a problem for 4 adults sharing the room and the odd setup of the lights turn the brightest ones on in the outside part to turn only the bathroom and the glare the brightest made on the tv the w was exactly what we needed on our trip great service standard amazing quality and a hotel bar that turns into a pretty hot spot to start the night off would definitely stay there again most likely only in a room with just my boyfriend,4.0
beware rigid 48hour cancellation policy enforced without exception,we had to cancel our reservation due to sudden illness less than 48 hours in advance of checkin and were charged a full nights rate plus taxes  no exceptions no rain check unless the future booking is made at the time of cancellation book with care,3.0
ended up being a great place to stay,"we booked this hotel as we needed a suite to sleep five for the car showour daughter and her husband and our adult son and us 
we also booked this hotel to be walking distance to the car show and because of the parking
we also told them we would be a very late arrival on friday and needed two queens and a sofa sleeper
when we arrived the valet took our car but there was no bell hop available nor a cart no big deal we grabbed our stuff and went on in
checkin went fine and off we went ot our room only find one king and the sofa sleeper when we called down to the desk we were told the hotel was completely sold out for the night and they could move us the next day they did not seem to care much about our concerns
but how were five adults going to sleep in one king and a sofa sleeper
they said we can send up a roll away ok we were tired and just wanted to sleep so we said ok
we were checking out the room to find there was only one sheet and one pillow for the sofa sleeper and only two towels in a room designed for 4 or more
a few minutes later the security guard g arrived with the roll away apologizing for the problem and told us house keeping was gone for the night when i mentioned the towels sheets and pillows he said hang on i will go find some for you
a few minutes later he arrived with many towels extra sheets pillows and some blankets and again apologizing very nice young man made us feel better about picking this hotel
after a rather rough night sleeping my son in law is 65 and didnt fit on the sofa sleeper very well and our son on the rollaway which is about 5 feet long and he is about 6 feet tall and the room temperature was very hot we could never seem to cool down the room
my husband went down to the front desk and complained and they moved us to a different suite the one we wanted in the first place they also gave him 50 off the cost of the first night seeing as we did not get the room we wanted very nice
so we moved our stuff remembering to grab the extra towels sheets and pillows because this room had only two towels also
this suite had the sink outside the tub and toilet area which was very nice bigger area with the sofa and tv and better heat control
we headed down to breakfast in the lobby a little confusing no one to seat us the omlette station was right next to the hostess center so we asked the omlette chef if we seat ourselves and he said yes so as we go to sit the waitress comes over to ask us if we needed help we asked if we could sit there and yes we could
she then asked for our coupons which we did not have i guess with certain levels of hilton membership you get free meals we did not
they had two choices of buffett fruit and oatmeal or full buffett with made to order omlettes
it took a while to get our coffee and juices but she was working hard and friendly
the buffett was good and the omlettes very good but a busy place the kitchen noticed the backup and came and took some orders to the kitchen to prepare very impressive
our second night was much more comfortable for all
checkout was quick and very prompt with the car
the coffee shop in the lobby was very affordable but was surprised to find it closed at 5 pm saturday evening when the hotel was booked solid
rooms were very clean friendly staff did find that the ice maker on our floor was broken and all the vending machines seemed to be sold out of water
the rooms were very quiet never heard the neighbors
it would have been nice to have a list of places near us to eat or delivery food
all in all it was a good stay yes it was a very busy weekend and they could have been better prepared for the number of guests staying there
if in town agin we will stay here again",4.0
very beautiful hotel and comfortable room,"my wife and i have just returned from a weekend in new york city i managed to get a decent rate on the internet for a queen room at the hilton the hotel is very big and nice it is in avenue of the americas several blocks above times square and the area is much more quiet than 7th ave or broadway our prior experience in a times square hotel had been worse as the soundproofing was very bad and we could hear traffic noise all night long
check in was very smooth and our room was ready when we arrived 1215 am the room was on the small side but it was clean and had a very comfortable bed and a huge plasma tv the bathroom was also very clean and very well appointed even though we were close to the elevators and only in the 12th floor soundproofing was great and we had a very good nights sleep 
check out was fast as it usually is in hilton properties but we had to pay for each item left in locker room having to pay for items in the locker room reminded me of the days when i stayed in hostels and i do not think it is a necessary practice for an upscale hotel all in all we will chose the hilton again next time in town",4.0
a great stay,"we dont normally stay at such upmarket hotels but this was a very good price at the time
the lobby was very posh and so to were the lifts  elevators 
we had an excellent stay in particular i found the staff in the lobby to be very curtious we were always greeted on entry the hotels location is an excellent position within walking distance of all the attractions such as pier 39 alcatraz tour  sightseeing tour buses
the city  alcatraz tour bus picks up from the hotel
some things were expensive such as items from the mini bar and bottled water but we didnt use any of these
we did have breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was very good for the price the chef in there was quite a character
parking is also very expensive as it is in all of fishermans wharf i think it was 38 per day  tips for valet only parking
parking did not worry us however as we parked our car in a multi story near budget hire on beach road it was expensive at 20 a day with no in out privalages but half the price of the hotel
the car park was about 10 mins walk away
i would certainly stay here again",5.0
great reception perfect location reasonable value,this hotel lived up to the expectations tripadvisor reviews had raised we have no hesitation in recommending it,4.0
it grew on mea little,we went there for the nike marathon upon checkin the ditzy desk chick wouldnt get past the fact that i was okay with her charging a ton of money on my debit card really its okayim not broke so get past my vans and hoodie and just give us our key our room was smallishpaint peeling view sucked and no cool kimpton robes im an intouch member but was told those were in some mysterious tower room only oh and the ac was busted and the windows didnt open i called for maintenance and the guy said the engineer would be right up 30 minutes later i called again to be told that the engineer had gone homebut would i like a fan after speaking with the manager the following morning we changed to a different better room at least the ac worked and i got a decent nights sleep before the marathon the manager also comped the night that we sweated rather than slept beyond that the hotel is in a stellar location in downtown sf the staff mostly was totally coolespecially keith and leban the doorman the hotel is old the beds are comfy and the housekeeping staff keeps it clean but it is an old buildingjust dont expect perfection no flat panel tvs no coffee makers in the rooms honor bar is decently priced room service is available in summary it is satisfactory but im not convinced its worth the money when we go back well probably give another hotel a shot,3.0
amazing service and position,we could not have been happier with our visit to the inn at the market the staff were outstanding the position absolutely perfect and we were lucky enough to get an upgraded room the hotel also has the most amazing rooftop deck for guest use brilliant hotel,5.0
great location for subways times sq etc,"we stayed during a heatwave in october and had five brilliant nights our room and bed were huge room 510 nice and clean no view but that was found on the rooftop bar we only ordered from the bar once as it was expensive 20 for a beer and wine but we took our complimentary coffee us there there was a separate area for smokers and they did not bother us
i would not use the hotel shuttlebus service back to jfk cost was 25 each could have booked a taxi for same and we made 4 hotel pick ups and 4 drop offs to different terminals took nearly 2 hours same journey by cab 45 mins unfortunately we were dropped at wrong terminal and had to get the airtrain it was a good job we had left plenty of time to check in",4.0
beautiful hotel  perfectly located,we spent 4 days at this hotel and we couldnt have been more satisfied this hotel is perfectly located the biltmore fashion park with many upscale stores and a number of restaurants is right across the street the suites are large very clean and well furnished the bed which is always a big deal for us was extremely comfortable we really appreciated both the complimentary breakfasts and the evening cocktail hour the breakfast was served in a beautiful setting with made to order eggs omelets pancakes etc the atrium lobby with its fountain and coy pond were impressive and a great setting for a drink or a meal any time of the day we had a room service dinner the first night and the hamburgers from the omaha steakhouse restaurant downstairs were outstanding best of all is the hotel staff everyone went out of their way to make this a memorable stay for us this hotel is a great choice for anyone visiting the phoenix area,5.0
comfortable and convenient,chose the coast gateway for a day layover in seattle on my way to costa rica the room was a bit small but sufficient for just myself may be a little cramped for a couple the room had a large window a comfortable bed and was very clean the hotel is extremely close to the airport 5min shuttle ride so it is extremely convenient for layovers the wifi access is great and the desk in the room was perfect for me to buckle down and get some work done the restaurant next to hotel has decent food and is open late so far this is my favorite hotel to stay at when traveling through seattle on my way to other destinations definitely recommended,4.0
yuck overpriced  not very nice,being out of towners on a business trip we accidentally chose a hotel on the wrong side of the tracks so we went in search of another and found the wwith its very cool lobby well the lobby was the only good part about this hotel after arriving in our room we couldnt believe how small it was you could almost stand in the bathtub and still reach the sink to brush your teeth it looked like a very old run down building that had a lot of knickknacks and trendy furniture added to it to try to justify the high price this was literally the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in and we have traveled considerably in the states and abroad besides the 8 bottle of water in the fridge you could find an intimacy kit complete with condoms and lubricating jelly and some waxed lips in your room gross yes the l is outside your window and is pretty loud but it is the least of your worries dont leave your window shades up as there are perverts in the office buildings next door that like the watch the guests this hotel isnt really next to anything except the l and the sears tower do yourself a favor and stay down by lake michigan there were many nicer hotels in that area of town there was constant thumping loud music coming from the dj spinning records in the lobby and the hallways were so dark you could barely see your way around they were also having some model shoot in the lobby as well which was weird their king sized bed room was not a king it was a double they had a fleece throw on top of the bedspread that had little hairs all over it i will never stay there again i am glad i can say i experienced the w hotels though so i know never to make the same mistake stay in a westin they are much nicer and not as expensive or trendy the only reason one would stay here is to rent a room by the hour the w chicago says trashy not classy,1.0
great location,great location in midtown friendly staff who will try to help clean small nice rooms nice touch to have a fridge and microwave in the room small efficient business center that always had space and no kids playing on the computers plenty of healthy and otherwise food for breakfast happy pleasant cook for hot breakfast options 3 small elevators were very quick and always available a big plus in mahattan hotels,4.0
great hotel with a good location,"we stayed at the elan for one night on the 29th august and although we had read the reviews which were positive for some reason we didnt no what to expect and a bit unsure
how wrong you can be
firstly i can confirm the staff are very friendly and helpfull we asked for directions advice on the area local restaurants and they did all they could to help 
room was nice clean and the bed was a nice large one
they had wine and cheese in the early evening which was a nice touch  you can help yourself to as much as you want
breakfast was continental style in the main reception area which was well laid out and had plenty of choices
as a tourist it was well located near the beverly centre and a short drive to hollywood blvd chinese theatre park in the new shopping mall and get a discounted ticket and a short drive to rodeo drive
wish we had stayed a bit longer but will definatley use this hotel if we stay around the area in future",5.0
large highclass hotel by the airport,"great modern hotel wasnt surprised after all its a hilton spacious beautiful lobby nice quiet room with modern appointments and a comfortable bed many choices for dining but the prices for food and drink were exorbitantly high but hey this is california after all
cant say i had much to complain about however the controlledaccess parking system was a bummer the automated ticket machine was malfunctioning twice during my stay and wouldnt accept my pass to further complicate things buzzing the concierge from the gate doesnt work if said concierge isnt at his station one morning i literally had to back up by car from the gate much to the annoyance of the people behind me repark and sprint to the front desk to let them know that i couldnt get out almost made me late for my conference 
i will say one thing about the reservation process  dealing with hilton general reservations has gotten to be a trying experience four phone calls over a twohour period and each time i was given different availability and rate information for this hotel even after i booked my stay my emailed receipt showed incorrect pricing information but thankfully the front desk clerk at the hotel helped me out by fixing the problem immediately and efficiently she rocked 
with the traffic in san jose its nice to stay so close to the airport however the location was also somewhat isolated and there was nothing else within walking distance",4.0
just an ok place to stay spend the extra money and go to an embassy suites,"arrived very late in the pm and was suppose to have a room reserved from a business block they had no such block but were very accomodating in getting me a room i found out later that they had lost our block of rooms request plus i did not get the corporate rate agreed upon from the block but that shouldnt reflect on the hotel itself as thats probably all arranged through someone else
as i mentioned before the staff was very helpful and a plus i received a room on the 6th floor which i guess was suppose to be something special the furniture especially the living room was really old the refrigerator looked ancient and was very loud although it was a larger fridge then youd find in some other suites hotels the bed and bedding however were very comfortable
the nightly welcome home reception was not that great keg beer and cheap wine plus the food didnt look very appetizing although i did have a salad the morning breakfast was better although i love breakfast food with scrambled eggs sausage links oatmeal plus cold cereal pastries and fruit
parking is limited so i ended up paying 15 to park in the garage each night 
the location depending on what you want to do can be a plus or minus there is a little grocery store next door if you want to stock the fridge and buckleys pub is just up the hill but for sightseeing or business you will definately need a car
i spent 179night not including taxes or parking i would probably recommend it at 129149 otherwise spend the extra 50 and go to an embassy suites",3.0
absolutely gorgeous hotel,"this was a really wonderful hotel to stay in we spent a week here and had a brilliant time the hotel staff were really lovely and nothing was too much trouble raymond and the other staff were so helpful giving recommendations for transport and restaurants most evenings we enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese reception which was a lovely way to relax after sightseeing and before going out for a show or meal it was also a nice way to get to know other guests in the hotel
the rooms were lovely and to a very high standard and the breakfast was delicious highly recommended would love to return sometime",5.0
amazing  we will stay here again  again,"we stayed here for our 15th wedding anniversary we were able to upgrade to a onebedroom corner suite on the 14th floor for a very reasonable amount thanks to the generosity  helpfulness of the front desk staff my husband is a priority club gold member  they told us they wanted to make our stay very special  they did
the hotel is a little intimidating to pull into at first glance because you have to drive over the sidewalk but the valet service was prompt  efficient  laughed with us at our parking questions he understood it was unusual to pull over the sidewalk
the lobby is beautiful  regal  very oldworld charming as i mentioned previously the front desk staff just could not have been better i mentioned our anniversary  that we wanted champagne sent to the room  they had room service contact us within minutes of our checkin
although we didnt eat a meal at the hotel we went to the top of the mark for drinks  appetizers the view is outstanding the martinis are great  their trio of grilled cheese sandwiches was really fun  tasty
the walk down to union square  chinatown is pretty short but that uphill walk back is brutal it made us feel less guilty for all the celebrating we did
on friday night after we returned from dinner in chinatown there was a beautiful plate of chocolate cake fruit  a chocolate mold of the hotel with a card wishing us a happy 15th anniversary we kept the card for the beautiful memory this hotel helped us create
we cant recommend it enough  cannot wait to visit again",5.0
unreal perfect hotel great staff awesome location,a large group of us have just got back from the sheraton we really couldnt have asked for more the staff were so helpful the rooms had everything we needed the location was perfect will be coming back to stay at the sheraton,5.0
a wonderful place to have a conference and first rate service,this hotel is a wonderful place to have a conference or meeting the plaza style of the hotel creates a calming atmosphere which can turn any meetin argument into a discussion the conference rooms were clean and had excellent natural lighting the food was greati highly recommend the oatmeal for breakfast the close proximity of the hotel to local attractions helped facilite a team building atmosphere as meeting attendees were excited to discuss nightly plans and organize activities the rooms were clean and i loved the patios the service was absolutely first ratethe best ive ever seen i hope to have the opportunity to come back to this hotel again,5.0
the inn with heart in boston,recently our family had the pleasure to again stay at the best western inn at longwood medical while our son was hospitalized in boston as usual the rooms and beds were comfy and clean staff supportive and friendly and the location perfect as well as the room rate reasonable for boston we have been traveling to boston childrens for our sons complex heart condition for nearly 10 years now but until recently we have not been fortunate enough to obtain reservations here during our stay this hotel seemed to be very popular and availability limited once we experienced the inn at longwood we began scheduling planned hospitalizations for our son around the hotels room availability we had found out first hand why it was so popular and didnt want to have to return to staying elsewhere during our last two emergency hospital stays the inn had no vacancies but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room the first time their desk clerk amy with the help of the manager bill davies managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim then just last week we were again faced with the no room at the inn situation and about to give up the manager bill davies went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament we were just about to give up late at night after checking back frequently during the day for availability when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us it is so refreshing to find that there are still caring people out there who will help you when the chips are down we will be returning to boston and the inn at longwood again tomorrow for more medical treatment and are thankful to have this refuge during times of struggle,5.0
great location well appointed but small rooms,i only stayed here one night but after my terrible stay at the hilton see other review i was delighted the location is far better than the hilton  you step out onto lots of highend shops and malls the lobby is hip with accompanying hip music and the staff courteous and friendly the room was small but contemporary clean and with uptodate furnishings and a flat screen tv plus it was over 100 less than the hyatt i was absolutely delighted i would highly recommend this to anyone despite the slow elevators,4.0
more than expected,"by far the best thing about the roundhouse suites is tiara at the front desk shes a treasure
i was in boston for a medical trip most of the hotels were full at the fairly short notice i booked wasnt sure what to expect from the hotel from reviews
the first experience of attempting to change the room type by email sent to the hospitality manager wasnt good since no one answered called and that was remedied
next experience wasnt too good either as the airport shuttle didnt show up apparently you need to get a confirmation email from the driver he claimed never to have received it
but from there on the experience got very positive very quickly we were told to take a taxi from the airport which tiara deducted from the room charge i have a thing about ground floor rooms and though there was nothing wrong with the room we got she changed us with a smile to a higher room
the complimentary breakfast is very good the nice lady who deals with breakfast is really efficient she keeps things flowing but get there on time because she efficiently packs away too 
the complimentary shuttle around town is excellent the guys are really accommodating and they give you a realistic time when they can arrive only had one incident with the shuttle and the amazing tiara was around to fix that for us too
my brother actually used the gym
theres a great mall within walking distance
we also got stuck in boston due to hurricane maria closing the airport danielle arranged for us to stay in our room which was a blessing
great hotel id stay again",4.0
disney haunted mansion vibe going on,"theres something oddly cool about the sax hotel in chicago its hard to put a finger on it
is it the fancy lobby absolutely not quite frankly the lobby isnt really fancy or a lobby its more like a hallway with bin 36 on one end and a reception desk that doubles as a place to purchase fine crystal on the other is it the super friendly staff nope reception folks are nice but about as nice as they are obligated to be dont expect a huge smile a hug and a free room upgrade this group  including valet  is all about efficiency and they seem to do it well 
perhaps one of the reasons i like the sax is because its just different than most hotels its got the disney haunted mansion vibe going on when the elevators open or you key into your room or visit the crimson lounge you get the sense a fog machine is about to start up and vincent price is going to greet you as a side note i swear the eyes on that womans picture in the elevator move but none of this is meant in a negative way by any means actually the mix of modern and somewhat darker motifs give this hotel a little character which in my humble opinion is greatly missing in most cookiecutter overnighters 
as for the rooms i have always found them to be clean and the late evenings quite the décor is trendy and unique the showertub combo is a bit small but suffices the phone rings the stereo alarm clock and tv are all in good working order the mini bar good to go comfy robes check beds and pillows are always subjective you should note that when i hit a bed its late im beat and im just glad its not a holding cell could the rooms use a little upgrade at some point probably but it shouldnt deter you 
perhaps the saxs best characteristic is the location no taxi needed to get to ten pin public house rockit bar paris club hub 51 keefers trump bar harry careys very underrated because of the name sake and a thousand other fun places for great food and drinks skip the cheesy tourist trap known in chicago as the house of blues unless you are attending a concert i love the location and if pressed could whip out another dozen or so not to be missed bars or restaurants without thinking and depending upon the event being hosted and the crowd the environment at the crimson lounge in the sax is a great place to meet people dance drink and ultimately end the night
guests at the hotel tend to be a little younger under 40and a little wilder looking than what youd find at the embassy suites down the street most are there to have a good time not just crash for the night while there are nicer hotel options cheaper hotel options and hotel options with more well options spa pool full menu room service etc in chicago the sax is a unique boutique hotel with an interesting interior and a hard to beat location worthy of a visit whether you are by yourself with a mate or a group of friends",4.0
construction outside my room,"i arrived late and was given a floor that had construction signs on the wall early the next morning construction started outside my room waking me up it continued throughout the day the hot water seemed to be out because of this as well and i took a cold shower
 on a side note during the winter months the heat is prefixed in the rooms it is very hot with no way to cool it down
 i do like the renovated fitness room and the location is central to downtown indy",3.0
nice but pricey ,"long overdue review for the nikko 
i had a room on the 16th floor with all the usual amenities youd expect the bathroom was a brilliant size with seperate shower stall and bath  excellent the king bed was very comfortable and there was no road noise a lot of the room showed wear  tear old carpet scuffed furniture etc which i didnt expect in this price bracket
i found front desk check in unhelpful and surly also shocked that despite having a fully paid voucher for the stay they booked the same amount again over 800usd to my visa debit card to cover incidentals beware if you use a debit visa my bank assures me this shouldnt be necessary which seemed excessive
failed to see any evidence of a japanese theme in the rooms other than the anzu  restaurant
the tv in the room wouldnt work i informed front desk to get it fixed several times as i was leaving for tours  meals out but they kept telling me to see them when i was back and theyd arrange it then  not good enough by the time i got in late from excursions i just wanted a drink and the tv working before sleeping and not waiting around for someone to come up 
overall given the price i was disappointed and would try somewhere else next time i would like to point out that the staff at the front door were excellent and always willing to help perhaps put them on reception ",4.0
a grand hotel in a wonderful city,i have stayed at this hotel on many occasions for business and once with family on vacation if you are watching your budget this may not be the hotel for your next trip this is a hotel from a bygone era dont let the modern facade of the building fool you as soon as you enter the hotel and make your way to the reception desk and see the vaulted ceilings and furnishings you can feel yourself going back in time the front desk staff is most attentive and often have people from all over the world working there they are quick to help and guide you on any question or concern the location is right in downtown san diego you can walk to most anything shopping eating and site seeing can all start from this location restaurants abound at all prices cuisine and ambiance shopping is nearby and again in different price ranges when you step off the elevator and circle around to your room you know you are in a very nice hotel each two rooms share a single keyed entrance to an anteroom then you enter your own room spacious is the word the decor is beautiful everything in its right place the bathroom is as big as you will see comfortable bed and heatingairconditioning i havent used the hotel eating facility because of the large number of choices nearby i would recommend marias mexican restaurant at 1011 4th avenue its a hole in the wall but the people are very nice and the food is quite good the workout room is well maintained with good equipment the uss midway is a must see there is a showroom with restored cars for sell in the wonderful gaslight district that is well worth visiting i would not hesitate to stay here for business or pleasure,5.0
back to this great choice,i came back to this hotel based on my previous experiences rooms and amenities are great free wifi nice continental breakfast very friendly staff location is my favourite in dc due to the charming georgetown with its nice cafes and restaurants nice surroundings and the brilliant barnes and noble bookshop opened until 11 pm the mall is not far from,5.0
not as great as before,noisy the elevator was only part of that and even though id asked for a room away from the elevator i got one closest to the elevator the sheets were itchy low quality not 100 cotton duvet was sparse towels were fluffy and fabulous the parking is expensive and there is a 7 hidden tax on top of the parking fee the little fridge in the room went onoff all night long noise and couldnt be turned off or unplugged due to their setup the tv reception was horrible the line to checkout was too long to wait only one staff member and they dont give you an option of automated checkout like most other hotels the hotel restaurant is closed for remodel yet they dont disclose that the gym is also in remodel at a room fee of 127 one queen or 2 doubles plus 32 per nite parking  the extra in hidden taxes and fees of 28 really put this over the top however the location is great for a downtown hotel,3.0
worst customer service,"we are regualr guests of this hotel since 2008 and we love staying here during our recent stay we noticed a huge drop in service we were made to queue during check in and the front desk staff was very uncaring looks like they have new people everytimethe manager jeff tried to help us but we felt that he was overwhelmed and uncaring
the room that was assigned to us was clean but not what we booked it was a low floor with a street view of ugly buildings we called the front desk and we were made to wait again jeff finally picked up our call and tried his best to offer a solution to our problem guess whatno solution we were stuck in this room because the hotel was sold out we asked for the general manager but was told that he was on vacation
we stayed overnight and left early we will never stay in this hotel and not recommend it to our company",1.0
very elegant great price,we loved this hotel after looking over the options on trip advisor we decided on the roosevelt for the price and the location the rooms were more than adequate the location was spot on we walked a ton and took the subway got lost for one hour but we were close to time square do not stay in a hotel at time square it is very bright and you will be sorry  so busy we purchased show tickets when we got there at time square but if there is something you must see i advise you purchase them ahead of time well before your departure date new york was fabulous and we plan to go back very soon very safe cop on every corner not that they need it people are very helpful and with common sense you will have an amazing trip,5.0

chicagos downtown sheraton towers was a great experience,with a city full of so many things to do and see it was great to have such an experienced and friendly concierge team helping us at the chicago sheraton towers hotel everything they recommended and suggested worked well for us and we had a wonderful experience we used all the services at the hotel from the pool to the wonderful steakhouse restaurant the staff service comfortable and clean rooms and great location make this one of the best hotels in chicago,5.0
no frills with lots of frills,this is a no frills hotel with lots of frillsnot the least of which is the price i paid approx 107 usd per night for a room with a queen bed the room was very clean and the bed very comfortable hint the extra pillows in the closet are in better shape than the ones on the bed no view but the sound from the hvac system in the courtyard provided a whitenoise background and i slept like a top lots of towels soap shampoo etcnot the expensive spa brands but they work just as well the business centre in the basement has 3 working computers with web access and a monochrome laser printer all at no charge the fitness centre had 3 treadmills and 3 bikes in addition to a other equipment also free complimentary continental breakfast has decent coffee juice toast and lots of other choices close to penn station macys 2 subway lines and lots of reasonably priced korean restaurants if you are on a budget andor luxury is not a must this is the place for you,5.0
love the rock,the hard rock is one of the funnest places to stay in sd the service is incredible the room are worthy of a rock star,5.0
good base for a tourist,"we stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in september as a disclaimer we got the room for free through the marriott loyalty scheme so i cant comment on value for money
the hotel is well located if you are a tourist visiting the city its actually one block off union square but its only a couple of minutes to walk there 
the room we had was a bit small by us standards but it was very comfortable and well maintained with an air purifier in the room if you feel the need for such a thing and a well appointed bathroom once again we thought the shower cabinet was rather small although it was certainly big enough to be usable the only real gotcha with the room was that it was single glazed only so you could be bothered by traffic noise if the same is true on lower floors we were on the 12th 
we never ate in the hotel restaurant so cant comment on the food the bar in the lobby was good  but you certainly paid city center prices in it 
the staff were one of the other real plus points everyone we met was consistently friendly and helpful  the kind of good quality service i would expect in a marriott the concierge in particular was incredibly helpful in giving us tips on where to go and how to get round town she also never made us feel rushed and always made time to chat darlene take a bow 
all in all we liked our stay here its not the most modern hotel in sf but we found it clean comfortable well fitted out and a good base for exploring the city as a tourist like i say i cant comment on value but recommended in other terms",4.0

a chic compact oasis downtown,im reluctant to publicize this hotelfor selfish reasons i absolutely love it the interior design is impeccable and general attention is a pleasure its located downtown adjacent to the gold coast and magnificent mile i stayed here for business 4 nights and didnt want to leave while the lobby and guest rooms certainly arent spacious hotel felix does a beautiful job flat screen tvs comfortable beds with nice threadcount linens and h20 bath products engage all the senses the staff is friendly and i never had any issues with reservations or car valet highly recommend this hotel for business travel or an intimate getaway for a couple,5.0
perfect for a short stay  ideal location,"we stayed at the holiday inn express with virgin holidays it was only a three night stay so for this reason the hotel was fine the room was large and the beds confortable we stayed in one room with our 2 children and had ample space it is in a fantastic location for getting around san francisco the bed linen was clean and a maid service was supplied every day we did not have the included continental breakfast as we chose to eat at the dennys around the corner we had a lot of help from the desk staff who advised us about how to get around and the best plass to visit and how to get there 
just a suggestion you must visit alcatras and book tickets at home as it is normally fully booked when you go to buy tickets on the dock on the day",4.0
comfortable clean  a great location,"so glad i stayed here during my stay in sf a few months ago
we booked through priceline and got a 2 person room full size beds for only 90 a night for roughly 4 nights which was great given our circumstances originally we had booked to stay at the grant plaza hotel which ended up being much less than ideal and would not have been a good place to stay for a slightly extended stay the spacious clean and modern rooms of the holiday inn were such a great relief the overall atmosphere of the hotel was much better than my prior experience of the grant plaza and such a lucky deal
as for the location of the hotel it was amazing as well its located roughly a block or two from the famous pier 39 and just about the same distance in the opposite way from the cablecar turnaround station 
while i understand that my opinion of this hotel may have been askew given the poor conditions i saw at the other hotel i still think this is a great place to stay during a visit to san fran not sure about what the actual rates of the hotel are but if you can score yourself a deal on a travel website its definitely worth it",5.0
exceeded expectations,"i stayed at the sheraton tribeca for five nights in a suite i was upgraded from a studio suite to a suite although i dont know how much i gainedthe suite was great though
the hotel kind of lacks the character that many older or boutique hotels in new york have but for a longer stay id rather be comfortable than feel cool i was very comfortable and for a reasonable price despite paying for a studio suite
i didnt try breakfast in the hotel or use room service there is a 24 hour deli next door which was extremely convenient bottled water was replenished each day
i was not looking for the typical midtown tourist experience and the sheraton tribeca was perfect for seeing a different side of new york having lived in hells kitchen years ago i wanted to stay downtown for a change of pace if you are interested in seeing more of the small businesses and boutiques that are unique to new york i definitely recommend the tribecasoho area",5.0

your best bet in nyc,"you cannot beat this price the location and the room in nyc we have stayed at the very best in new york and this is just a great hotelas is their hotel in chicago which i find amazing for chain hotels

the bar downstairs was quite nice the front desk was quick and effcient and room service was a no problem

best stay in new york,i last stayed in the hotel back in january 2002 my wife and i went there for our honeymoon the service we received from the staff was exemplary all where friendly and could not do enough for my wife and i also our two friends we where given advice of where to eat and places to see i can not believe the write ups this hotel is getting my wife and i are both thinking of returning there with our two daughters cant wait,5.0
pros and cons,for the money you are spending you shouldnt be surprised i think it was worth the money and its within walking distance of several of the tourist destinations dont be fooled by the pictures the hotel isnt that great looking but lets be honest neither is san francisco the building is old and the location makes it difficult to find parking so youll have to fork up the 21 to park in the hotel parking lot a lot of interesting people roam outside at all times of the day but they dont cause too much trouble the only aspect i truly didnt like was that it was noisy at all 24 hours of the day which made it hard to sleepim a very light sleeper room service was fine did a good job hotel staff was helpful so all in all i have no regrets in booking the monarch i feel as though it was worth the money but i must say i wish they wouldve left some of those chocolate mints on my pillow,3.0
good location friendly personnel clean facility,"my husband was here on business and i came along just to keep him company and check out downtown chicago from the greeter at curbside to the bellmen valet and front desk personnel all were very friendly and welcoming our room was a nice size and very clean two comfortable chairs for relaxing tv on the smallish size but adequate however had to have someone come up and jiggle wires to get it to come on also a friendly employee love the button by the door that indicates do no disturb or please clean room very convenient
the bathroom was awkward to use no towel rack for the hand towel had to drape on the sink which resulted in a wet towel several times the toilet tissue was behind the toilet and difficult to reach we resorted to resting it on the tub the small ledge was not conducive to personal effects and lighting was poor however it was very clean 
i wish there was a lobby where you could sit and watch the foot traffic on michigan ave they did have a starbucks and a hotel bar with limited access to people watching the bar food was very good nice staff very helpful without being intrusive the starbucks was very busy but good service quickly lots of business people on computers fun to check it all out good view of michigan ave 
we ate at michael jordans restaurant at the hotel nice decor good staff not remarkable food not bad just not great a tad pricey but to be expected for the location on a side note we enjoyed the bar food so much more
all in all a good visit and would come again",4.0
the price is right,"i had contacted the constitution inn directly after finding the inn thru the internet their pricing is based on your military rating

perfect mid priced funky getaway,this hotel was priced midrange but was better than we expected we have stayed in great hotels and dives and this was pretty good overall we expected more cheesy from the pics but it wasnt that bad the place had a funky vibe the staff was awesome and friendly the rooms had clean white bedding no nasty bed spreads and the continental breakfast of bagels and pastries was nice would stay here again,4.0
1920s deco stuck in the past,"my partner and i stayed here between 8th december  12th december the lobby is well decorated and unfortunately gives a false impression of things to come the rooms are outdated and in our case bordering uninhabitable 
the window did not close properly causing a draft into the room the radiator  heating system did not work despite upgrading to a penn 5000 room the room was worse than a bogstandard room we had last year the corridors could do with a major replaster which can also be said for the rooms
location is excellent this is a cheap hotel where you really do get what you pay for which is not much fortunately we did not have any issues with bed bugs",2.0
this place has so much to offerexcellent front desk staff saved our families sanity,our family of 4 was saved by this place we relocated from arizona and was in the process of finding home to live originally we had checked into a different hotel we found on the internet when we arrived to the other hotel we realized we had been scammed small room stolen microwave scary neighborhood was afraid my room would be robbed after staying at the other hotel for 2 days we drove around and came across this place patty the front desk room supervisor was the best she let us check out one of the rooms and we were sold the single room was larger cleaner then the other long term hotel suite we had been staying in and much less expensive and had so much more to offeri am surprised that its not rated higherthe service here was amazing thank you patty for all your help if i had more room to rave about this place it would be never ending,5.0
great location recently renovated,"i had the queen deluxe room for a conference i was attending here the room is fairly small but it was nicely finished you could tell they recently renovated it it looks like everything but the doors and door trim was changed the bed is super comfortable the bathroom is luxurious with walls lined with marble and some nice kohler fixtures including a shower that feels like you are in a rainshower i needed to do some computer work and a desk with power outlet was available kind of disappointed they charge 14day for internet luckily i was able to tether to my cell phone and got decent reception
i was also made aware that they redid their fitness center it has a bunch of treadmills stationary bikes ellipticals dumbbells and a set of different strength machines i liked it a lot with all the food thats available in boston it is nice to unwind with a good workout to finish the day
location great copley square is a great location the magnificent boston public library is right across the street and is a must see there are a lot of shops and eateries near by and you can walk to nearby boston public park and commons chinatown etc i bought a mass transit 7 day pass for 15 which allows me to hop on any bus or subway definitely made food possibilities more doable
staff very friendly i am generally low maintenance during my stay but my interactions were all met with smiles and friendly attitudes",5.0
thought it was great,"we thought that the hotel was fine for a small boutique facility that was clean nicely appointed and had a friendly staff very quaint it doesnt have a bank of high speed elevators like the larger surrounding facilities but you could converse with the staff without having to wait in line for 20 minutes free morning coffee in the lobby was a nice touch
it is conveniently located off michigan avenue across from water tower place and is attached to ditkas restaurantthe reason for the faint smell of cigar smoke 
a great facility for couples wanting to experience downtown chicago",5.0
this is the best hotel to stay in houston,i have stayed in this hotel several times i am here again this time with my family this is a really lovely place to stay the manager is really a wonderful man the owner is a very helpful person i am from australia and this is not my first stay here i read negative reviews for this place here and wonder why i am here now again i am happy if any one wants to ask me if this is a genuine review i have never ever felt such welcome any where in the world trust me i have travelled all over the world  this is not my first hotel stay i think this is the best hotel stay i have ever stayed in a friend saw reviews and said to me is this true what people are writing here and when i read them i was so supprised this place is a nice comfortable safe place for any one to stay in i recommend this place to any one who is looking for accomodation in houston any one can email me or phone me to confirm my statement,5.0
good hotel with soft beds advance booking to save,be advised peoplethe beds are soft if you like soft go for it if you like firm dont the rooms are small clean  functional the location is central to times square ny accommodation is expensive all round so i suppose 350 last minute per night is about right advance payment options through the hotel website is recommended to get the best rate do it months ahead to really save we paid about 210 ex tax 3 months ahead it was almost double that near the date of stay enjoy,4.0
excellent hotel and felt safe as woman traveling alone at night,i was a little concerned as a woman traveling alone arriving at night via the airport shuttle but there was absolutely no need to worry the shuttle driver arrived promtly and was very friendly the room was very spacious and clean and room service was quick and tasty i would definately recommend this hotel as a perfect overnight when traveling in and out of phoenix airport,5.0
lovely accomodation in a great location,myself husband  our 2 teenagers stayed at teh beacon for 4 nights august 2010  can honestly say it lived up to the great reviews on here we stayed in a one bed suite with an extra roll away bed there was more than enough space the suite was smart well equipped and immaculately presented while the staff were welcoming and efficient best of all the neighbourhood is charming with a great range of local restaurants and shops within a stones throw all just a short stroll away from central park  just a short hop on the underground from the main attractions in short the beacon is a real gem would stay again in a flash,5.0
better experience here than other reviews,"my wife and i and our two small kids ages 8  6 just spent 4 days here late march and early april i had read all of the posts on this site about the westin la cantera and our experience was more positive than some others here are some thoughts
first i used starwood points for the stay and had requested a view of the pool we were very pleased with our room it was on the 4th floor and was plenty big enough for the 4 of us with a nice sitting area balcony large bathroom  of course the westin heavenly beds whether my room was bigger than the majority of the rooms at the resort im not sure i did notice that there was ongoing construction on the outside of the 1st floor rooms that faced the driveway we speculated it had to something to do with some of the complaints of dampness that visitors have mentioned in earlier posts the westin has a great location for families just down the street from six flags and an easy drive to sea world expect however about a 2530 minute drive to the riverwalk area
second my family loved the pool facilities the staff handed out pool toys for the kids to use without any rental charge all of the facilities seemed nice but i have to admit that we did not eat at the restaurants since we were visiting relatives nearby
third like many of the other posts i did notice problems with the service that you would not get at similar resorts we had problems on both days that we ordered lunch by the pool the food was unreasonably slow in coming out of the kitchen despite the fact that the pool area at midweek was not crowded at all both waitresses got simple orders wrong and i was finally forced to go to the bar and ask for silverware
finally a word about the parking do not pay the 12 per day valet charge the self parking is not that far i feel like some of the earlier posts complaining about the distance are from travelers accustomed to staying at motels were your car in right in front of your room 
overall an enjoyable stay",4.0
nice hotel and good location,the palmer house is a beautiful old hotel off monroe street which puts you close to the waterfront public transportation restaurants and shopping the hotel has a beautiful lobby with restaurants and bar attached i didnt try the bar or restaurant but it was fairly busy through out my stay the rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable i was here with family and we needed a crib which they brought up at no charge nicely decorated to keep the old look but had a new feel the gym is very nice but they do charge a 10 fee to use it the pool is small and could be updated they did offer a movie in the evening for kids but the water was freezing the hotel concierge is very helpful and friendly beware that if you drive and have to park the hotel parking is 42 per day with in and out privileges not that surprising for city parking but best to know in advance i would definitely stay here again,4.0
not outstanding but pretty good,not an outstanding stay but a pretty good one we found a gross number of hairs on our bed comforter but when we called the front desk they immediately brought a clean one hotel bar and restaurant is just that a hotel bar expensive and over priced but if you want a drink without going out it gets the job done small pool complimentary internet fridge and microwaves in rooms are a plus wish we brought some food and drinks to stock them so we could have saved some money valet parking was expensive but consistent with the rest of the city 40 per day great location to a number of restaurants as well as historical sites would stay again,4.0
first class service  part of the culture,"i stayed at this hotel for third time this year for a week on business and i will continue to stay there in future visits to houston the rooms are perfectly comfortable and the general ambience is relaxing and unhurried all the amenities are very good ie bar restaurant gym pool business centre courtesy transport etc however the most striking thing is the consistent friendliness cheerfulness and helpful attitude of the staff they do the hotel great credit for example
1 i realised on the first day that i had forgotten my electrical adapter british to us they gave me one
2 i had trouble printing out in the business centre one of the people on reception came instantly to the centre and explained what i had to do 
3 hard at work on the stepper in the gym i was pleasantly surprised as one of the cleaners brought me an ice cold bottle of water
4 the restaurant and bar staff are particularly cheerful attentive and courteous serving free drinks etc on the patio during the daily happy hour although at times very busy they demonstrate an ability to engage all the guests positively making for a great atmosphere
i felt that all this was absolutely genuine and as a customer i felt valued  so i had a really enjoyable stay  what more can one ask for",5.0
bring your own light bulbs,"the designers of this hotel clearly valued appearance and trendiness over functionality the elevators are so dim it is difficult to find the correct floor button the lighting in the rooms is so poor that i had difficulty finding items in my bag even the bathroom lighting is relatively dim the beds are very low no box springs so be prepared for a long descent when its time to retire the one chair in the room is metal cold and pretty uncomfortable the seating in the public spaces of the hotel ranges from comfy armchairs to incredibly small uncomfortable yellow plastic chairs lets not mention the log in the bar with the metal seat backs inserted at random intervals 
 nyc hotel rooms tend to be noisy but this one exceeded any expected noise levels the heatingair conditioning was very noticeable as was the untraceable constant whine that combined with the other ambient noise i was awakened several times during the night by noises that seemed to come from the window frames or outside the hotel
 on the plus side the rooms are scrupulously clean the outdoor garden is beautiful as is the library you can visit those areas of the hotel without having to endure staying there stay at the hudson hotel if its more important to be in a fashionable than a comfortable functional setting",2.0
great choice in chicago,"i booked a room in one of affinias suites and was very impressed when we walked in the pictures do this hotel no justice very spatious and clean the layout of the room was impressive as well
check in went very smoothly and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful i did have one incident in my room involving my curlers blowing up in my facesparks and all i called managment and they sent an engineer and hotel manager up right away to investigate it turned out that it was the curlers that were in its last leg and not the hotels fault they actually took 50 dollars off of that nights stay and they didnt have to do that at all
i do have to add that we used the online conceirge service and ordered rose pedals to be sent to our room we received a confirmation email and everything but they never arrived and we were never charged this incident was the only con about this hotel
affinia is only a block away from the magnificent mileperfect i also like how it was a walgreens right around the corner very convenient
if you want to experience luxury with a trendy twist make sure you choose affinia i will be back",5.0

best customer service in the industry,after a long road trip from las vegas across the scorching death valley desert as soon as i stepped into the lobby the manager was there to greet me with great customer service he went above and beyond his call of duty to help us out during our stay the manager was even kind enough to recommend good places to eat nearby i would recommend this hotel just based on the customer service alone thank you,5.0
contemporary luxury in downtown san francisco,this was my 3rd stay at this property having stayed in their astor suite and metropolitan suite contemporary furnishings with ebonized wood floors luxurious cream marble baths carpeted bedrooms amazingly comfortable king beds solicitous and mannered staff from greetersvalet at pullup in the rental car and thorough kind mannered and well trained front desk staff prompt service from room service valet car pickup requests and on premises restaurant ame  is there anything else i can do for sir  was a common question with each encounter with this hotels staff stay here if you like contemporary furnishings spectacular city views lobby bar and lounge is popular with locals and can get busy and noisy later in the evening well designed lobby and public areas perhaps this property is not for you if you prefer traditional furnishings though i enjoy the complimentary coffee available in the mornings on the fourth floor by the casual restaurant and the large l shaped gym on 5 i did not use the 6th floor pool or spa however prompt and thorough housekeeping staff and eager to please turn down service in the evenings with every request met promptly and willingly museum of modern art is next door and metreon center is across the street for films union square and market st shopping just a few blocks away my only negative observation is that the roomsuite furnishings are looking slightly worn some stains on the mohair sofa and wood furniture looking very slightly scratched lovely thick towels bathrobes generous toiletries closet and drawer space is very limited however a common design flaw among higher end contemporary hotels i find high speed elevators with rarely more than a few seconds wait i love the motorized curtains and sun shades in the suites bedrooms although i must say the centralized touch screen telephonecommand center can be frustrating and confusing to use unless you concentrate and look closely at the screen and its functions,5.0
swanky and expensive,nice clean rooms with very elegant appointments wonderful view and onsite dining very accommodating and knowledgeable concierge the rest of the staff is questionable we asked for a razor my wife forget hers and we were preparing to go to a wedding and once a maid brought up a pillow and we had to call the desk three more times to get it not our usual place to stay a bit out of our price range and we got the wedding deal would have expected a little more for what we paid but we were in the same hotel as the reception which was convenient,4.0
perfect hotel in a perfect location,i cannot say enough great things about henderson wharf inn right in the heart of the beautiful fells point section of baltimore i have fallen in love with fells point with its many unique bars restaurants and shops its quaint cobblestone streets and its wonderful and friendly residents the henderson wharf inn is a perfect match for fells point as its far enough away to be away from all of the noise and hubbub of the bars but only a short walk to be right smack in the middle of all the fascinating night life the hotel itself is gorgeous and situated right on the harbor for spectacular views and panoramas especially thru the door sized windows the two large queen sized beds are extremely comfortable and you even get a complimentary bottle of wine to put in your ample sized fridge upon arrival the service was professional and courteous especially our hostessmanager lee the parking is free and so is the succulent continental breakfast that offers only the freshest fruits bagels and coffee all of this at a very reasonable price for everything you get my only qualm about writing this review is i dont want everyone flocking here because i want to have the inn whenever i want it and i plan on making several more trips to this pearl in the middle of the diamond that is fells point,5.0
extremely disappointed,"i stayed at this hotel on saturday june 1415 2008 i booked my reservation directly on their website and redeemed 25000 reward points i am a frequent traveler work related and have stayed with the crowne plaza and other intercontinental hotels on a frequent basis over the years
when i checked in the desk clerk had no clue about my room being paid for with reward points i gave him my copy of the confirmation for the reservation and the proof 25000 points had been deducted from my account he said the daymanager would figure it out the next morning and proceeded to charge my amex card for the room a clerk in the back came out and looked at the reservation on their computer system and told him it was right there he then removed the charge and then stated he would need to hold 30 for incidentals i did not have any issues with that
when i woke up the next morning i found the standard bill under my door with a charge of 25 for accommodations plus taxes when i went to check out later that morning the desk clerk said she did not know anything about reward points or priority club membersyet they have a section of the front desk roped off for priority club members go figure
the front desk manager anna came up and checked my account she said my reservation did not reflect my reward night i said to her the written confirmation is in the file she grabbed it and looked at it  i told her the night manager told the night clerk it was in the system and pointed it out to the night clerk 
anna snapped at me and in a very unprofessional manner and condescending attitude said it was not in the system i asked her if it was not in the system how did i have a printed confirmation from their website and the night manager pointed out the system reservation to the night clerk she give me this dirty look and said she would manually add it and remove the 25 accommodation charge
during this whole exchange i was calm polite and professional i decided at this point i would never stay at this hotel again i am a corporate training manager with lockheed martin and me and my staff 65 trainers live in hotels around the country on a weekly basis i have also earned 100s of thousands of reward points for this hotel and others as a priority club member i was surprised to be treated in such a matter
i was placed in a very small room that faced the parking lot the room and bathroom was extremely small thankfully the room was clean as usual the crowne plaza beds were comfortable
overall the stay was ok but the attitude of the staff and in particular anna left a lot to be desired my group and i will never use this hotel again",2.0
nothing special but no complaints,stayed in this hotel for two nights on business check in was fast and simple room was clean and well appointed but not very pleasing to the eye room could use some updating the refrigerator was an antique but it worked fine the tv was the best aspect of the room the location is very convenient to the houston medical campus about a 5 minute walk overall pleased with my stay,3.0
romantic and cozy,we stayed at the mansfield on a short vacation to the city loved the champagne reception on our arrival and chatting with the young witty staff found our room to be tiny with a view of a brick wall but enjoyed the down comforter and modern bathroom fell down the slippery marble staircase should probably take the available elevator if you dont want to go for a slide,4.0
you must stay there,"i have just returned home and i cant wait to share my good time in union square hotel it was my last destination in 
san fran of my around the world trip budget accommation must be my target as money shouldnt have left much price of 
union was relatively cheaper than in sydney three stars hotel i am working in three stars hotel so i am quite informative in prices and quality  with the cheap price offered i would not expect much more than a bed for a good sleep suprisingly it is much higher than my expectation
 i was checked in a room in the central of the whole building 
it was quite spacious with a lounge and bed area on different sides of the room a welcom kit has all sort fo needs which i reckon not many hotels would provide housekeeping and all staffs are very professional room was cleaned thorughfully and flawlessly exspecially in toliet  awesome location makes your time saved coffee and tea provided every morning from 7am to 10am micro wave to reheat food and ice machine is also ava check out time is at 12pm and i requested a late co till 1 pm the best moment was when i got my bill it was only less than 85 us per night incl tax what a great value for money
 the only downside is noise noise in room facing powell st  cable car rail is unavoidable you should request a better room when you book will definilty stay there next time",5.0
not what i hoped,the hotel was hard to find especially at night  you have to go down a oneway alley to it and its not very well marked so its easy to drive right by when i finally arrived there was no parking lot or parking garage a lot of noparking signs and there were many questionable looking vagrant characters standing in the street  didnt feel too safe off to a bad start the hotel was in ok shape not great  spots on the carpet dingy paint etc the walls were thin  could hear people talking upstairs and in adjacent rooms  so i slept with the tv on low to keep other sounds less distracting there is no thermostat in the rooms  only a baseboard heat system that didnt seem to work and a ceiling fan two light bulbs out in the room no outlet plug close to the bed turns out there are a lot of homeless people who live outside the hotel and you have to pay to park a block away this is lower priced than most hotels in the area but its nowhere near the quality i expected the positive reviews i read on the internet before i booked are very suspect whether they were genuine  dont know how anyone could call this place a great place put it this way if i had had my kids or wife with me i would forfeited the reservation deposit and stayed elsewhere,2.0
had a nice stay,"the thing that stands out at the hilton university place is the staff my contact with this property began with an email to john noonan who booked our rooms although john had been out of town my email was returned within an hour instantly it was as if i was dealing with an old friend throughout our stay to a man the staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything that we wanted
i booked two rooms on the exectuive level for the jimmy buffett concert upon arrival we found both rooms to be nice and clean i requested that the rooms be close but not too close the assigned rooms were separated by three rooms perfect both rooms had a nice view and were equiped with a microwave oven but no refrigerator although not a big deal a refrigerator would be a nice addition
we used the executive level lounge for breakfast the food was nice and consisted of bacon eggs fruit cereals oatmeal yogurt and assorted breads and pastries there are only a few tables so when it is crowded you may have to wait if you want to sit to eat
overall i had a very pleasant experience at the hilton and would stay there again",4.0
nice hotel but limited food services and no meaningful room amenities,friendly staff clean room and great banquet food but with only ruths chris steak house on property limited food choices breakfast price in ruths were outrageous 18 for coffee juice and oatmeal would choose mid range motor inn next trip to seattle,3.0
good business hotel with huge rooms,this is a pretty good business hotel located in a nice neighborhood on 34th and lexington the rooms are massive and well equipped theyre more like a studio with a full kitchena good bathroom and a big work desk i stayed on the 30th floor and the view is not too bad from up there either its pretty close to the 33rd street metro station and theres a deli and supermarket just downstairs for the price that i payed it was a pretty good deal ,4.0
beautiful hotel impeccable service wonderful location,"my girlfriend and i stayed for a single night in the hyatt regency in baltimore and were more than impressed with out choice the hyatt is in the perfect location for those wishing to visit the inner harbor go to a game at camden yards andor attend an event at the convention center
we decided beforehand to use valet parking as the price was very similar to that of selfparking the valet service was impeccable and prompt we did valet parking for the day and although we checked out at 10am we were allowed to keep our car there without any additional charge till 5pm this effectively allowed for 2 full days of parking while we enjoyed ourselves in the inner harbor
i have always wanted to go to a ruths chris steakhouse the front desk called in our reservations gave us incredibly easytofollow directions and upon our return asked us how our experience was as we walked through their automatic rotating door
hands down this was the best hotel stay i have ever had when going to baltimores inner harbor there really is only one great option",5.0
superb in every way,the blackstone has to be one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at period end of story from the extremely comfortable feather beds to excellent customer service to turn down service with chocolates no detail is overlooked at the blackstone the staff is very friendly and helpful the hotel is as clean as any hotel i have ever stayed in the fitness center is also excellent it has tall windows with panoramic views as far as lake michigan and fresh fruit available for the end of your workout the compliments could just go on and on but simply put stay at the blackstone and you will not be disappointed,5.0
what a treat,"ok first  the location right off of faneuil hall near the north end exceptional you are a quick walk to so many things the whole weekend we were there we walked with a toddler no cabs one subway ride and one bicycle cart ride definitely recommend the property is very nice our room was a suite and was spacious quiet and very well appointed we were on an upper floor and the views were outstanding
while i dont rate the breakfast high lots of  for very littlequality the evening cocktail hour is fun and the room where they have it it is very comfortable
lots of extras  they have a very extensive playroom for kids a nice workout facility etc
it would be nice to have the option of room service and some of the other amenities you might expect from a hotel but i guess you dont get from a timeshare also plan for valet parking and paying for it there isnt any other way to park your car
all of this being said  none of it outweighs the overall experience which was fabulous",4.0

make sure your shots are up to date,"in forty one years of traveling i have learned to try and stay with major chain hotels when in rural areas to insure at least cleanliness not so anymore this place was simply the worst and dirtiest hotel i have stayed in since i was a kid renting rooms by the hour every aspect of this place is bad from the ill kept front desk staff to the roach burns on the bedspread no kiddingto the crayon drawings on the walls the fact that in both rooms we rented they only made one bed a day was actually funny this is my candidate for the all time worst corporate owned hotel ever

great ny hotel in great location with great staff,we booked this hotel for a 1 week family vacation in new york which turned out to be nearly a 3 week stay as a result of air travel cancellations caused by the volcanic eruption in iceland the hotel was fantastic with spacious and comfortable roomssuites and was in a very convienient midtown locationwalking distance to many attractions and close to the subway for easy access to other areas of ny however it was the welcome and customer service from robert and his team which really sets this hotel apart from the rest the hotel had to cope with cancellations and delays from many customers but went the extra mile to make sure that standed guests were accommdated and made welcome by week three the hotel was certainly a homefromhome,5.0
nice overnight stay,staff great friendly helpful hotel just renovated still working on it priceline deal  76 for the one night stay hotel did have a contl breakfast but was not included in the priceline price what that was a slite sting to our morning breakfast also railroad employees coming  going  in  out of the lobbythey have the whole third floor reserved for them but all in all a good stay,4.0
comfortable room friendly staff attentive service,i had an excellent experience at the hotel icon the valet greeted us with a warm reception the check in was seemless and the room was very nice and very comfortable we ordered a roll away bed and it came to the room within minutes of checkin we ordered room service which was prepared exactly as requested and received a personal call from the kitchen staff to ensure that the order was correct if you ever have business in central houston i would strongly encourage you to stay at the hotel icon,5.0

great family hotel,"we stayed here in june with our 5 and 8 yr old loved it staff was great very friendly and helpful with directions to seaworld
loved the free parking and location short walk to trolley which takes you all over sanantonio breakfast was well above average
in the evening the manager would put out a cheese tray or they would have a popcorn machine all in all a good hotel for a good price",5.0
average motel with parking in great location,"weve stayed here many times mainly because it is within walking distance to castro and possibly the only decent hotel in the area with parking and prices are reasonable for san fransisco 
its basically a motel 6 decor several rooms have been renovated over the past couple of years and are usually clean showers now have decent restrictedflow heads and the tiny soap dishes are not falling off the wall the cable is comcast with lots of channels better than a lot of big chain hotels security has improved with installation of keyactivated doors to enter the stairs which used to be accessible by anyone off the street 
main irritations all the tvs are old tube type with terrible pictures many of the small frigs are missing shelf brackets which limits usable space being right on market be prepared for sounds trolleys sirens at night 
many decent restaurants are in easy walking distance trolley stops are within 121 block which makes it easy to get to downtown and elsewhere cabs are not expensive and the desk will call for you typically 30 minutes or so to get to sfo by shuttle if the hotel is full dont count on finding a parking space on your return in the evening better to take cab or trolley 
if you plan a trip for gay pride or one of the street festivals castro dore alley folsom reserve well in advance 6 months and expect a minimum stay requirement and higher rates",3.0
the customer service decor location and value of the element shows why this one is ranked no 1 in houston,"i had a great experience at this element as i had never stayed at an element before upon arrival i was instructed that the room that i was assigned had a maintenance issue they offered a very nice discounted rate and i asked to check it out and declined 
the manager came out and appologized for any inconvenience and i was upgraded to another room without any extra charge i was actually given the discounted rate 
the room very nice with a classy finish to it this would be excellent for an extended stay considering you can cook anything there with a wide variety of appliances the best of course cant be beat being a westin heavenly bed 
the stay went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable 
i stayed a day later in july and brought a pet and was given some neat goodies as this is a pet friendly hotel as well 
rest assured this is in a prime location for business or leisure and i will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family",5.0
very disappointed,"visited years ago and this visit was very different we remembered an upbeat place with modern hip boutique atmosphere loved its location decor size rooms this visit the hotel felt as if the place was old and unkept while still trying to be that cool nyc boutique hotel but missed the mark we are a midthirties couple with a child who prefers smaller boutique hotels over your big brands but this time i would have preferred the marriott
proslocation is excellent in the midst of midtown and steps to rockefeller center times square and central park only other pro is size of roomsvery big and they do have a modern decor a little too much less is more thoughthere is almost nothing that it appeared to be let go not cool 
consrun down over the years somewhat dirty they were spraying lysol everywhere when we arrived and it reaked and roomselevators just felt fine nothing specially attended to no amenities restaurant and room service are closed for some reason and we were never made aware customer service no one greeted us and the reception area was dark and unlit reception had no clue of a room change they just seemed to do their job manager tried bait  switch see below
so we requested early check in and was so graciously given it because they were able to give us a different room that was immediately open and because obviously no one else would have wanted it being pregnant and with a 4 year old we were very happyuntil we got there the room they so graciously gave us was yes huge but it looked like an old efficiency apartment with a new bed thrown in it it was unkept reaked of lysol dirty stained rug had an old disgusting kitchen outdated bathroom and the hallways to get to it looked like rent by the hour rooms if i had never been to the hotel before and not known what the newer floors looked like i would have demanded my money back and went elsewhere we were switched back to our original room and the room was fine but our overall experience left a lot to be desired we got a low rate so i cant complain but would never pay full price or really even go back 
oh and on a sunday morning when all 40something floors are trying to leave there were two small working elevators and you had to wait at least 1015 minutes if you could even get in an elevator my husband ended up walking down 9 flights with our suitcase because he had waited 20 minutes and still couldnt hitch an elevator ride all the people who had gone to the lobby to get their complimentary breakfast were stuck waiting forever with coffee and bagels in hand trying to get back to their rooms
my expectations were so good after having been there years ago and its obvious that it has been let go it was fine for one night but if you appreciate the hotel experience this one is lacking we felt like we rented a decent room somewhere not that we had stayed at a comfortable hotel",2.0
excellent  if you book a bay view room,we had a bay view room for 4 nights and it was excellent for an extended stay  great room great view i wouldnt have liked to be in one of the other blocks  dark small and rather dreary a few minor elements could have been better  no showercap coffee making facilities but not good for tea paper cups at the price we were paying room crockery should not be disposable no feedback form we were given the option to hold on to our towels for more than one day but this was ignored the firefly restaurant and pool area was top class the food good the service mixed parking at 18 per night was steep and unexpected where did the managers think we would park our cars its not an innercity hotel with limited space this was an opportunistic gouge,4.0
great hotel,loved this place in spite of it being close to times square i tend to prefer less busy parts of the city the staff is great everyone was helpful the room was a bit small but its ny so thats the norm use of the ny sports club was nice because you get the benefit of a full gym would definitely stay here again,5.0
not a nice as prior trips,"ive stayed at this hotel twice before 2004 and 2006 and wasnt as happy with my recent stay as ive been in the past 
although we booked back in feb we got a room right by an elevator which was disappointing 
the location is really good we were able to walk to times square in a few minutes 
the complimentary continental breakfast is lame it is poorly stocked and not all that filling if you like a big breakfast to start your day order from the menu or go out",3.0
very comfortable hotel great atmoshere and restaurant,"i stay was great i spent some time in the atrium bar and the staff was very hospitable i had room service which was some of the best that i have ever had 
i will definitely stay again my next trip",5.0
good value very nice stay friendly stuff good location,"i stayed there with my boyfriend and another friend in a twin room the room was nice with 2 windows heating television closet to walk in everything was clean and we even had a large sized mirror bathroom was next door 2 on the floor apparently 3 in the aisle on the other site of the elevator and it was never really a problem getting the bathroom sometimes u would have to wait for 5 minutes but really this was not a problem at all staff cleaned bathrooms frequently just 2 minutes to the metro direct metro connection to timessquare and all the main spots in the centre the only thing the elevator was quite slow but it was always a challange to see who is quicker elevator or walking and if u dont mind walking its not a problem
beds were comfortable maybe blankets a little thin so in winther a little cold but i am usually frozen so this might not really mean a lot tv programms were ok remote control snacks in the lobby to get for little money and coffee for free in the tv common room in the near area many foodplaces and restuarants for very good prices go to broadway and turn right some meters and there is a big take a way place with pizza cake salat paninis sandwiches and so on nice staff there too and so close
very nice hotel with very nice staff and i will definitely stay there again next time i come to new york",4.0
adorable hotel for solo travel in nyc but dont plan an event here,the hotels inability to handle a small convening was a nightmare but the hotel was very cute what can i say i thought that i had found the perfect boutique hotel for a clients convening but boutique hotels sometimes come with a price inefficient systems lack of response etc it didnt help that there was a portage fee for each box and the sound person had lunch break scheduled for noon as union members should but the av company of record for the hotel didnt send in a replacement for that hour where does that leave a convening without someone to set up mics for the lunch panel but if you are just hanging out in new york and you are looking for something off the beaten path its a good rather inexpensive alternative,3.0
breakfast chef,i hate mornings however when i stay at this hotel and lassandra greets me at the madetoorder breakfast bar with her wonderful smile and cheerful attitude my day is made then no matter what i order she creates and serves it with the same attitude and smile needless to say the food is always delicious embassy suites has a gold mine in lassandra,5.0
2nd time and still very good,"we stayed here last year and decided to stay again as we had a good experience we are a family of 2 adults and a 2 year old we like having a separate living room area so we can have our son in another room for a more peaceful nights sleep the rooms are huge and well equipped  the only complaint about the rooms is that the decor is very drab  lots of brown 
the breakfast is great and its nice to find somewhere that includes breakfast in the price there is a great selection including a cooked breakfast and cereals yoghurts breads etc a bigger selection of fruit would have been appreciated but then we were in the minority most people were eating the fried food and lots of it the managers reception in the evening is also a nice touch 
check in and out was easy enough and the valet parking was straight forward yes it is expensive but can anyone tell me where you can find it cheaper in a location like this the location of this hotel is perfect its right next to sea port village and its a few blocks walk to the gaslamp area we didnt want to be in the middle of it all and staying somewhere a bit quieter was appreciated 
the only real complaint was the booking process i was shopping around to get the best price and phoned up the hotel direct the woman told me that if i booked directly with them they would be able to guarantee a cot for my son whereas if we booked through a 3rd party they could only request it and not guarantee it so we booked direct and then when the email confirmation came through it said a cot had been requested but it wasnt guaranteed when i phoned back i was told that they couldnt guarantee them which is not ideal when youre flying from the uk and cant bring one with you the manager though did sort everything out for us though and upgraded our room by way of an apology so great on customer service we will be back if were in san diego again",4.0
loved it again,"reviews a little late but
my husband  i first stayed at the amalfi in 806 totally based on reviews i read on this website we were totally wowed loved the location the room the aveda bath products but most of all loved the evening reception  breakfast on our floor
i returned to chicago with 3 girlfriends in 907 and booked us in a suite at the amalfi it was great  room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased will stay next time im in chicago too ps they honor a government rate",5.0
fantastic hotel fantastic location cant wait to go again,"just come back from a four night stay the hotel location couldnt be better right in times square but very quiet inside our room was lovely quite small but comfortable breakfast was lovely and the staff couldnt do enough for you we found because of the hotel location it was ideal to pop back to the hotel to refresh and have a coffee always available in the lounge area and a pastry or biscuit also the cheese and wine in the evening was great very friendly atmosphere and a nice way to start your evening out
we couldnt fault this hotel and would definately go again",5.0
great location for a fun weekend in nyc,stayed at this hotel with my mom for a long weekend in nyc great central location for access to downtown times square and central park the hotel is beautiful and the room was great plenty of space for two people with two beds the lobby bar has a great view of times square we paid for a regular room but requested a higher floor and got it you can also request a fridge if you want it,5.0
good location reasonable rates,we stayed here for 5 nights during april 2012 paying in advance resulted in a good discount on the room rate the rooms were nicely furnished and spacious the hotel seemed fairly new everything was in good shape the staff was very helpful breakfast was good but unchanging ie same menu every day no pool but you can use the pool at the nearby holiday inn the hotel was literally two blocks from fishermans wharf and also two blocks from public transportation cable car trolley and bus the 27 transit pass for a week was a good deal without the pass a cable car ride is 600 one way so it pays for itself pretty quickly,5.0
average works if youre out of the room most of the day,dont accept a room on levels 14 that face the interior of the building theres no airflow and our room was very warm very uncomfortable the people at the front desk were pleasant except for one woman who was very short with me when i complained about the room the next night we were moved to a suite that had a bed couch and 2 bathrooms it was completely unnecessary and the room with the bed and bathrooms were actually smaller than our previous room i wasnt impressed by the gesture of the suite in some way it felt insulting other than that the room was clean and nice i was disappointed with area we stayed because the restaurant selection by our hotel was limited and there didnt seem to be much to do,3.0
superb value location and service,booked one washington through hotelscom and had both an excellent rate and complimentary valet parking enjoyed a spacious suite including a full kitchen internet access etc staff is extremely helpful will book it again for next dc travel,5.0
very pleasant,i thought this place was a pleasant surprise although i didnt have time to take advantage of any of these nice facilities the pool looked large clean and inviting and there was a hot tub nice caferestaurant on the premises and very helpful staff and airport shuttle service doesnt begin till 6 am though and ends at 10 pm my bed was extremely comfortable with plenty of nice big pillows and the wifi worked well good water pressure mini fridge in room but no microwave a very quiet and restful and comfortable place to spend a night or twoid definitely come back here,4.0
great for families,"this is a great place to stay that is convenient to both downtown or its less than 30 minute drive to schlitterbahn in addition to being near sea world  fiesta texas the breakfasts are great  the afternoon snacks we have often used as supper which is such a money
saver for families the rooms are always very clean  service is fantastic",5.0
our 5th trip to ny and we decided to,"our 5th trip to ny and we decided to escape from times square this was the hotel that most matched the facilities of our usual hotel i found that their website was misleading there was no tea and coffee available 247 in the lobby apart from that minor inconvenience the staff were pleasant the rooms large compared to usual and modern and v clean the area was as expected turn right to chinatown and left to little italy and a short stroll to soho subway nearby 
overall an ok trip and glad to have experienced a downtown hotel but sorry we love to be in the hustle and bustle uptown and in walking distance of central park so would probably not stay again but would not dissuade others from visiting this hotel",3.0
good location near anschutz med campus,stayed here on business while visiting the uc denver anschutz medical campus there are one or two closer hotels but this had a much better rate room was nice and clean and the free breakfast was plentiful and uncrowded it is far from both downtown and the airport and the trains are pretty loud in the middle of the night but would definitely stay here again,4.0
new hotel  great service,"stayed here on 101510 because we had a 5 am flight out of jax airport the following morning 
the good with the hotel being new everything was beautiful and worked perfectly the layout of the hotel and rooms matched prior hyatt places ive been at the room is spacious and includes an lshaped sofa that converts to a bed a kitchenette with minirefrigerator desk partial wall blocking the bedroom from the sofa area and a massive plasma tv 55 inches the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable the service at the front desk was speedy and friendly best of all the hotel will let you park your car there and they will shuttle you to the airport as well as pick you up on your return  for no charge shuttle leaves every 30 minutes and the hotel is about 5 minutes down the road from the hotel lastly theres a shopping center 5 minutes away if you need anything for your trip
the bad truly hard to complain about anything regarding this fabulous hotel the only thing i would change is the shower  theres a stationary glass wall rather than a curtain unfortunately you have to basically walk into the shower to turn it on meaning even if you have lightning fast reflexes youre going to get hit with a second or two of cold water after turning the shower on not a deal breaker for an otherwise great hotel
no need to post pictures  the hotel and room look exactly as advertised",5.0
be very careful what you book,"we found a great deal on a night at this hotel when we arrived i found out why t
first off there was no one at the desk and there were around 1520 kids between the ages of 1214 just running around the hotel unsupervised as we waited i walked in the back looking for someone and there was no one around meanwhile the kids were jumping off the stairs in the front and acting like any junior high kid will when unsupervised they were unbelievably loud after about 10 minutes the desk attendant arrived and apologized saying that she was the only one working that night and she had been called away thats a little scary i could hardly hear here because the kids were still acting crazy when i asked if we should expect this type o noise level all bight she said what do you mean i said really she said  oh those are just teams then i said hey i hauled my kids all over the us with teams for 12 years and have seen nothing like this she then rolled her eyes and went out and said something to the kids who moved down the hallways about 10 feet and continued to be loud and boisterous at that point we just asked where there was another hotel close by that would take us and she called next doo and we moved to another property",1.0
pleasantly surprised,"i didnt know what to expect but i chose this hotel based on the trip advisor ratings
the hotel is new and it is evident it feels clean which is a great feeling when you are not sleeping in your own bed
this is what i would consider a cheaper version of cambria suites it looks like cambria but finishes and decor are not as nice
i would definitely recommend it as long as it is new it looks great",4.0
beautiful sheraton,this sheraton hotel is a convenient choice if youd like to be close to pier 39 it is beautifully furnishedrenovated just last yearand beautiful through out quiet elegant hallways very comfortable rooms weve stayed here a few times usually prefer other hotels in sfdue to area not necessarily the accommodations at this sheratonwhich are fine we prefer to stay away from fishermans wharf and on the occasion that we must stay at fw prefer the area by the hyde street pier as opposed to pier 39 however this is a beautiful and spacious sheraton very comfortable with exceptionally professional staff i highly recommend this sheratonif your preference is proximity to pier 39,4.0
mother daughter  girls trip,"my daughter and i just returned from 5 days in nyc celebrating her 30th birthday i have been in nyc previously through work but she had never been we enjoyed ourselves immensely in no small part due to our stay at the hilton garden inn in times square 
the staff were incredible and could not do enough for us we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a corner room so had a great view down the block towards times square  great for checking things out but far enough from the madness when you wanted quiet room was clean and kept that way throughout our stay by great housekeeping staff we got great tips and insider information from the conceirges on staff during our visit we had great times at all of their recommendations whether it be for a restaurant or sightseeing the location was great to catch the broadway shows we went to and to pick up the subway when we ventured further afield 
i routinely stay at hilton properties when travelling for work and the hilton garden inn in times square outshines is a shining star in the chain i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again when i am back in the city",5.0
great location,this hotel was awesome because we drove to chicago and its right off of the highway i liked that it wasnt downtown but that cabs were cheap and readily available,5.0
location location location,what a find not minutes but seconds from times square and central to many tourist attractions a small hotel with a huge emphasis on customer service from the moment we arrived to the day we left nothing was too much trouble the staff are friendly rooms very clean and the 247 complimentary refreshments extremely welcome when suffering from jet lag i cant recommend this hotel highly enough we enjoyed it so much we stayed twice  once at the start of our holiday and again at the end all staff at the casablance hotel deserve high praise indeed they obviously care about the people they look after total strangers who arrive weary after long flights are met with a smile and a helping hand it took me five months of research to find a hotel for our first visit to new york and you did not disappoint thank you,5.0
if you like bedbugs youll love the milner boston ma,"after about 20 minutes to get checked in i was given a key to my room i entered the very small room walked into the restroom and was greeted by a small beetle looking bug on the floor i thought no worries just a beetle after a long day it was time for bed the sheets werent the crispiest id ever seen but this is a twostar hotel when i woke up i saw another beetle crawling across my pillow i contacted the front desk and informed them about the beetles throughout the day i began itching i noticed red bumps all over my body i thought oh my god they have bed bugs i complained and the management switched me to another room which i learned the hard way had bed bugs as well 
the bed bugs were one of the many problems at this hotel the hotel is in desparate need of renovation the bathroom tub was extremely grimy this place needs need serious attention it has potential but it is poorly operated",1.0
not very impressive,quite simply  this hotel is highly overrated the service as noted by others is lacking i was looking at the hudson and this hotel for a three day stay in new york over new years i chose the gansevoort for its location in the meatpacking district and reputation as a fun area to stay the district is entirely commercial during the day and only at night does the area come alive most of the people coming into the area are coming for the local clubs but if you plan on seeing the rest of the city the location puts you a further cab ride away i reserved the grand deluxe room the room was small but clean and had a modern design the bathrooms were nice for ny standards the view was of the meat packing district and the river however the heater in the room would not turn off call one to the front desk then the mini bar key was locked with no key call two then the remote control did not work call three not exactly what i expected for nearly 700 a night the lobby is small and the rooftop bar is equally small especially when tented during the winter the ny party was packed with very little seating and completely indoors also ran 175 per person just for drinks and a few appetizers for my last day i decided to try the w tuscany on park avenue it had a small lobbybut the rooms were just as nice as the gansevoort and much bigger for 319 a night although a more business locationthe hotel was much closer to most of nycs attractions i also visited the hudson to see what i missed out on the hudson still has the gansevoort beat on style the library bar and main bar are beautiful as is the garden bar just a much more hip hotel,2.0
wonderful service,i gotta be honest when i go to dc sometimes i get a little nervous there are some areas that well may not be to safe this wonderful hotel was an oasis we could see many of the historic monuments from out window,5.0
great service in a nice hotel,"came for a girls weekend  a nice hotel but we didnt really use much of the amenities of which there are few  no lobby at all but it is attached to the marriott and la live did walk up to the pool which is beautiful but it was a drizzly day so we didnt get to enjoy it the rooms are pleasant and spacious beds are comfy and i love the tv in the bathroom mirror
the best part of the ritz experience is the service the bellman went out of his way to walk us around and we were always greeted by name and they did mess up with a birthday cake order but more than made up for it by sending up complimentary champagne cookies and cheesecake at 2 in the morning after our night out",5.0
classic and classy,date of lodging november 911 2012 i wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday with a trip to philadelphia so that she could take in all the historic sites and great food that the city has to offer i knew nothing about penns view inn prior to booking my reservations and knowing that my wife prefers quaint historic bed  breakfast lodging over four and five star any day  i wanted to give this establishment a try well  i am very pleased to say that not only was my wife surprised but i was very impressed also the staff antonio  the manager personally escorted us to our room and you could tell he was very knowledge about the hotel and the surrounding area the room was a small suite on the fifth floor room 508 it was perfect  from our balcony we could see the river and in the other direction we could see the steeple of christ church dinner in the hotels restaurant was first class  and the room service was quick and courteous when you read this review you have to ask why should i believe this guywelli have stayed in numerous four and five star hotels in many major cities and in hawaii and even as a rewards member of two of the major hotels i have not been this impressed with attention to service and detail also the different drivers from the limo company that i used daily for our three day getaway all had great things to say about the establishment  and they got nothing for saying it either nice walk to the historic sites and really great little shops only a few steps away on market street enjoy one little thing extra  when we arrived at the hotel the first night my wife walked into the lobby with a bouquet that i had the driver bring to the airportit was not in a vasewithout askingand this may seem to be a common sense thingthe lady checking us in brought a vase to my wife with a pair of scissorslittle things like that is what i am talking aboutwhen we left the beautiful bouquet was proudly displayed at the hotels front desk,5.0
posh hotel w free happy hour,nice finish level in this hotel the valet entrance has a blue back lit lighting scheme which was kind of cool we got a suite with a kitchen and sitting room for 218 the bar had a free happy hour when we arrived free beer and wine which was cool its close to many restaurants and bars but to get to lodo its better to take the free bus,4.0
quiet comfortable beds no views free parking,got a cheap rate online of 189 for two queens and free parking which in san fran can run you up to 50 a night nice beds good linens dated but quiet great location nice bar two blocks east great breakfast one block west on van ness where you pay for a great eggbacon sandwhich hotel breakfast was coffee muffins and fruit again free so its worth it if you have kids if you just want a nice bed to sleep in great location and two blocks from cable car go for it otherwise no view no frills place but the free parking and inout privileges make it worth it nice folks run the place too,5.0
too bad about the noise,good facility even if its 80s avantgarde design is now retro friendly and responsive service but had to change room at 1 am due to disco noise which the hotel is strangely powerless to stop also the sky lobby and keyed elevators are a nuisance,3.0
great locationgreat value,"we stayed at the drury plaza last week friday and saturday night we were able to check in early about noon which was nice the lobby of the historic building is beautiful great historic details
the room was in the san fernando tower and i was aware based on reviews that it was a bit of a mice maze to get to the rooms in the newer tower but the room was worth it we were on the 12 floor facing the san fernando church with the riverwalk below us the room was quite large bathroom bedroom and then down a hallway a living room with a bar area small fridge microwave sink etc and a balcony overlooking the church and plaza the room could be used by two couples although there is a frosted window between the bedroom and the living room so not total privacy or a family of four 
the big thing with drury is the free stuff free wifi was a plus we hit up the free happy hour once but did not eat there the happy hour was quite busy and there were lots of people treating it as dinner we just had a couple of small cups of draft beer not really worth it to us the free breakfast was better eggs pancakes sausage cereal fruit coffee juice bagels biscuits etc we had breakfast there both days and took coffee to go along with a piece of fruit for later
the location was great right on the riverwalk a short walk to the commercial district on the riverwalk we did not use the pool but the one of the roof has a great view my husband used the gym which he described as basic a couple of times we ended up taking the stairs as the elevators seemed overused 
for the price we paid 140 a night i thought the room location and free stuff was a great deal on a holiday weekend",4.0
family vacation,we stayed here during our recent family vacation to denver it was in a good location easy access to the interstate and close to the bronco stadium i felt the room was very nice and clean the free breakfast in the morning was good but typical my daughters felt the beds were uncomfortable but i didnt mind them my only complaints would be the parking is poor very limited unless you want to park up the hill in a seperate location also the swimming pool is in the basement very dismal and spooky as my daughter called it so she chose not to swim which is usually what she looks forward to however i felt the price was reasonable and the decor was new so i wouldnt mind staying here again,4.0
dont expect any breakfast unless you wake up early,"we stayed in one of the king suites the suite was very very large the decor was modern and the room was very dark it looked like the kitchen hadnt been updated since the 80s but was in good working condition the room wasnt terribly clean and my wife found hairs on the pillows the room reeked of a chemical smell unfortunately someone who used the room before us had smoked in it my wife is asthmatic and after shortly after we arrived she started wheezing after complaining to the front desk we were transferred to a different room which was much better unfortunately this room had a loud generator outside the window whirring away but at least nobody had smoked in it 
the buffet breakfast offered in the morning was simply pathetic the buffet runs from 710am on weekends and we arrived around 9am it was clearly understaffed and the few people who were working the buffet were unable to keep much of anything stocked despite their best efforts first of all there were no normal size plates available we had to use those little plates meant for toast cutlery and napkins were a luxury and after a 10 minute wait my wife and i gave up and split the 1 set we were able to obtain the food situation wasnt much better than the dishes and we had to wait a good while to get sausages eggs and potatoes the selection of muffins was never restocked nor was the yogurt bread or oatmeal so i cannot comment on these but what little food we ate was not of good quality 
parking costs an additional 26 for the valet or 8 per exit if you use self parking there is no pool in the hotel",1.0
great stay,"just stayed at this hotel for a weekend after staying downtown for business and overall had a very good stay my room was pretty big i believe because it was a king size though my room was facing the train that goes by every 45 minutes or so it did not bother me but do note that there are rooms facing train tracks if that will bother you 
for those not rentingdriving a car the shuttle service to the jfkumass red line stations was excellent very reliable came at or close to the times it was supposed to every half hour from the hotel and every half hour from the subway and runs pretty late most memorable driver was ike i believe he drives weekdays only very outgoing comedic almost felt like a tour guide location is also good across the street from major grocery store some other restaurants down morrissey blvd and right by the hotel
one minor thing ensure to put your privacy please card in the door or hotel lock on at night or until you leave the room and are ready to have it cleaned the housekeeping staff start their rounds pretty early in my opinion like before 900 am and just start knocking on doors presumably if you do not have the card in your door one housekeeping lady even let herself into my room after not hearing me say just a minute 
otherwise very nice stay and id come back",4.0
very pleasant stay at the stregis hotel,"i stayed in the st regis for three nights over new years with my partner overall i would rate this hotel very highly
it is an old charm type of hotel i found the all the staff to be very polite and helpful especially the concierge who always helped us find the things we were looking for and when i got sick during the visit arranged for the doctor to call me and an appointment with the doctor within 2 hours which was much appreciated
the beds are heavenly so snug and comfy the bathrooms are a lttle outdated as i have read in the other reviews but they are still nice and have an opulent feel to them they are just a little outdated but the room we had was really lovely
the breakfast room is very charming 
overall we enjoyed our stay very much and we would certainly go back to the st regis",5.0
loved the hotel,"i got a great rate of 109 on hotelscom so that made our stay even sweeter we checked in got our arnold palmers half tea half lemonade with fresh mint and headed up to our room 
everything was clean and in good working order i loved the bedside lamp that only needed to be touched to work the linens were very nice and the bed comfortable one minor gripe  no free movie channels  not even hbo our room overlooked the roof and pool area we didnt swim but it looked like people were enjoying theirselves
at the 500 pm wine tasting i tried the sangria it was white rather than the more traditional red and was not sweet at all there was also a hot hors doeurve served another small gripe is that there is no coffee maker in the room this means you have to dress and head to the lobby before having that first cup of coffee which i would prefer not to do 
overall it is a lovely hotel the common areas are chic and comfortable the room is fabulous i think anyone would like this hotel",4.0
not up to double tree standards,have stayed at many double tree hotels have always had a suite was shocked when i entered my room and discovered it was a small single room with a king bed perhaps i should have looked at the website closer hotel is very clean everything in the room was in good working order staff was very always very friendly and helpful check in was a breeze hotel was very clean convenient location to the tufts medical center subway station merely a few steps away from the front door 40 a night for parking valet parking only 1295 a day for wireless internet connection,4.0
good experience,"the hotel is in a good location right on scott circle nw in the mornings i would walk 510 min to the farragut north metro station there are eateries and shops along the way in the evenings i would get off at the dupont circle station and walk 15 min back to the hotel i always felt safe walking in the neighborhood whether in the daytime or nighttime its better to take the farragut north train towards glenmont in the morning rush hour because a lot of business people get off at farragut north 
as for the hotel everything was pretty good my room was clean and spacious the bathroom was clean and the shower had good water pressure and temperature i lucked out with a room at the front of the hotel facing the australian embassy my room had sliding doors that opened up to a balcony railing there was no balcony just the railing the only problems with my room were i had a tough time with the sliding doors once i opened them i had a trouble closing them and the ac did not kick start right away it made me question myself whether i was programming it correctly eventually it did start and i didnt have trouble after that
i was surprised the courtyard did not have its usual breakfast buffet they only had a sitdown restaurant i got the allamerican which was pretty standard oj at 3 seemed a little pricey there are plenty of places in dc to grab breakfast though in the afternoon the front desk offers warm cookies whats nice is that they are covered so no flies
the library was really nicely decorated and had two computer terminals however i used the free wireless in my room and it worked fine throughout my stay parking is expensive 28 but cheaper than other hotels if you need to drive there are zipcars across the street on bataan st nw and an avis rental nearby on m st nw
the only overall issue i had with the hotel was that the front desk staff could be more outgoing they were friendly when you asked them questions but no one went out of their way to address you i was never greeted they will only talk to you if you talk first the only person that asked if i needed help was the valet he was was in the lobby while i wandered around looking for the bathroom on the first floor",4.0
perfect location excellent hotel,"we wanted a hotel which wasnt massively expensive but in a great location and this was the perfect answer 
it is located right next to macys and a short walk from times square and obviously right next to the empire state we also walked to central park which did take about an hour and a half but you got to see lots of the city the metro station is a few metres from the hotel so it is very easy to just jump on 
we were on honeymoon and asked for a free upgrade when we arrived and were moved to a queen size room the rooms are snug but very clean and sufficient perfect for us as we hardly spent anytime there 
breakfast was ok  a buffet of cereal toast pastries and bagels which we were happy with  they only supply plastic plates though i did think it might have been a nicer touch to have crockery 
we didnt eat in the adjoining grill bar but the menu looked ok  we did have a quick drink in the bar there is a nice candle lit bar accross the road from the hotel
whilst in new york we would recommend visits to the river cafe which is the most amazing restaurant by brooklyn bridge a cafe called good enough to eat which served beautiful home cooked breakfasts and the revolving view restaurant at the top of the marriot in times square
we would absolutely book this hotel again it was spotless comfortable and in the perfect location",4.0
good service and fun atmosphere,the hotel was clean had a great bar in the lobby and had a lady at the concierge desk tk karadzovski who was very helpful tk booked a reservation for one of the best architecture boat tours down the chicago river for us she gave us good restaurant suggestions and she reserved an audi car that was being promoted at the time to pick us up and bring us to a wedding we were going to i would definitely stay at this hotel again,4.0
good position,very good position the room was clean and comfortable bed was very large and toilet clean the service was good we left baggage on deposit without any surcharge,4.0
great location and great value,"stayed here in january for three nights with friends  had a great stay the rooms had all the expected amenities and were very clean the pool was great and the hotel was a fantastic value compared with nearby hotels as canadians we always marvel at the chance to buy alcohol in grocery stores and there was one right accross the road
although the elevators were slow and the rooms fairly small the stay was fantastic and we would all agree that this place should be recommended to anyone",5.0
great stay in seattle,stayed here for a few nights in may this year basically loved it the hotel is out of the cbd a bit in a nice suburb with great variety of good value restaurants it is about a casual 10min walk to the space needle about 5min to key arena to get into the cbd could you always catch the monorail for 2 and save the 30min walk the hotel room was generous well decorated and clean it had a real comfy bed but the bathroom had a noisy exhaust fan which i found kind of annoying even with the door closed the room had a kitchenette complimentary water popcorn and coffee it had a fridge and microwave etc which was great as there is no restaurant or breakfast but there is an awesome supermarket nearby 3min walk with everything prepared at excellent prices there is starbucks downstairs free internet access at 2 computers in the foyer the staff should also get a rap they were great  friendly helpful and courteous  cant thank them enough also dont forget to go to the roof nice views of the city overall would definitely recommend and would most certainly come back,4.0
a great location for the mall attractions,"let me first get something off my chest i like the way the general manager takes the time to respond to the comments on this forum im less thrilled that heshe glosses over any negatives but i hope this one grabs the attention and elicits a reply  the parking at your hotel is outrageous to even contemplate charging nearly 50 per night to park shows a contempt to your guests and leaves a nasty taste in the mouth since so many people here have mentioned it why dont you do something about it
now after that little rant on to the rest of the review which is overwhelmingly positive my partner parents and myself stayed here for four nights over the july 4th weekend as the eighth and penultimate leg of our 22day grand east coast tour
we booked two king rooms for four nights i found that the prices for this hotel differed widely on many websites so its certainly worth doing a bit of research i was amazed that i ended up paying just gbp63 per night approx 100 through a uk based web site e book ers when the hotels own web site was charging more than double that at the time so do shop around
the rooms were great with a really comfortable huge king bed large flat screen tv chairs coffee table drawers etc unfortunately no coffee maker or fridge which we would particularly have appreciated and if you end up in rooms 503 and 505 you wont get much of a view to be fair i dont think many rooms would have a view to get excited about
there was a pillow menu in the room which allowed you to choose from six types of pillow if normal feather ones do not suit we ordered two and one was brought up to us within an hour by housekeeping being british we didnt like to mention the missing one and just smiled politely when it arrived
there was an interesting pool area on the roof deck surrounded by trendy chairs trendy people and a completely bored looking lifeguard other staff we encountered in the hotel were efficient and polite rather than overly friendly
as many have already said the location of this hotel is great and just a 1015 minute walk from the capitolmall or to the union station area wanting to see the fireworks on the mall on the fourth of july and having read horror stories about the crush using the metro afterwards we really wanted somewhere easily in walking distance this was the perfect solution
we didnt have breakfast in the hotel it wasnt included in our rate and was very expensive otherwise so johnny rockets in the food court on the lower floor of union station was the best option we found there didnt seem to be many alternatives in the area neither is the area teeming with restaurants although we had two excellent meals at excellent prices at the capitol city brewing co just opposite union station
if you find a good rate at this hotel and want somewhere comfortable and classy within walking distance of the mall then we very much recommend the liaison
finally to end where i started let me say that of course we didnt contemplate parking at the hotel many others have pointed out that parking at union station is a cheaper option well there is a much closer comparatively priced option on the same block as the hotel just turn first right from new jersey avenue onto e street and its just 50 yards along on your right its called colonial parking it cost 74 for four days cash needed the same price as union station and a third of what the hotel would charge it was well staffed and monitored  the staff wanted to see identification on entry and asked how long we were going to be there we felt very safe leaving the car there thanks to kim lovenotes who first mentioned this in her review from 11 april 2009  i think its well worth bringing to peoples attention again",4.0
worst value for your dollars,here is what you are not getting for their sizzling deal 99night like they call it poor air conditioning no free internet 999 they have a sign that tells you how to connect but i had to call at the reception to find out about the surcharge no breakfast no newspaper no public phone they used to have one but they took it out for money reason no wine bottle opener it took the lady at the front desk 10 minutes to find one and when she found it she was hesitating on giving it to me saying that people never bring them back ice machine on the 4th floor was broken so i had to go down to 2nd floor the windows in my room wouldnt open 75 cents every time you make a phone call from your room no comment cards at the reception or in the room no paper and pen in the room to take notes my last comment is overcharge for what you get dont expect much is you go there a tv and a bed and you will be happy then,1.0
wonderful time at the edison,"have just spent 5 wonderful nights at the edison we found the hotel to be clean and comfortable the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was to much trouble
i admit i was worried about the reviews that had been posted on ta but i have nothing but praise  yes the rooms were a little tired  we had a room on the third floor and it would have been nice to have a coffee maker in the room  but with starbucks across the road it didnt present to much of a problem 
the location is perfect  would i stay again yes and hopefully will do so again in july",4.0
great downtown hotel service spectacular,"we recently dropped off our daughter at san jose state university on a saturday we installed her in her dorm and checked into the hotel montgomery which is 34 blocks away we let the hotel know our reasons for staying the night when we confirmed a few days prior check in was quick and friendly upon entering our room we discovered a champagne bucket lavender candles vanilla bath salts and a note welcoming us and noting our accomplishment and the staffs good wishes for relaxation
this touch made the bittersweet event more sweet than bitter the staff did a great job making us feel welcome and put us in a celebratory mood
we had drinks in the onsite bar  restaurant paragon then moved in and had dinner and then back to the room we didnt leave the hotel until we checked out in the morning
great stay over all the rooms was comfortable the bathroom had a separate shower and a bath so i think they might have even upgraded our room but i cannot be sure
when we visit our daughter over the next four years we will be staying here at the hotel montgomery",5.0
never againhorrible,hotel is old and run down front desk staff arent friendly or helpful room rate is supposed to include parking in the adjacent lot but it was full front desk clerk was unable to assist me on the parking issue so i left a message for the manager he didnt call me back after 24 hours so i left another message again no call back i cornered him in the lobby the next day he claimed he never received my message when we finally discussed the parking problem he was rude and refused to reimburse me for the cost of parking in the pay lot down the street stay someplace else,1.0
cant beat the marriott,the marriott in the fianancial district was the best we really wanted to stay uptown but the rates kept us downtown my first new york experience was staying at the marriott marquis but that was when i did not have to foot the bill prime location especially when you are 19 and single living off of mom and dad was definately needed back then and the marquis was the best but now travelling with children security cleanliness and budget comes first we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel we were in a great location we could see the world trade site from the hallway while awaiting the elevator the huge discount department store 21 was very near the hotel as were the subway stations it was very easy to catch a cab by the help of the bellman the conceirge helped us with finding bubbys restaurant in tribeca and even when it was pouring down rain the front desk gave us nice umbrellas location is everything and surprisingly the marriott was the best location to suit our needs we left the hotel early every morning and returned after 10 pm every evening i felt very safe and secure we shopped and dined all day and when it was time to retire it was nice to return to a quiet uncrowded area to unwind we ate the breakfast buffet in the morning a bit pricey at 20 per person children were half price the spread was fantastic though everything you would ever want from fresh fruit to made to order omelets the fitness center and pool were very nice also the entire hotel was spotless we stayed in the corner room with 2 queen beds and plenty of space to spread outthere was a nice bureau and a desk with a chair and a lounging chair the beds were out of this world comfy the bathroom was full sized and very euro chic and most importantly clean all in all i have not one bad thing to write about the marriott financial district,5.0
very cool in hot washington,great hotel great location great city the four seasons washington is a true luxury hotel and is well worth the cost the conceriege were very helpful and helped make our stay very memorable only slight complaint was that the olympic opening ceremony wasnt on live not the hotels fault i must add,5.0
quality inn converted to liaison hotel terrible place to stay,we stayed at this property for two nights over thanksgiving weekend when we checked in they had no king size rooms available so we go up to the room and the room had no powerno lights they switched rooms this room had a dirty bathtub it was so disguisting hair all over the tub what 4 star hotel doesnt have a coffee maker the room was very small on top of all this the noise from the other room woke us up at 1am i would definitely not recommend this hotel at check out they didnt even bother to ask how was our stay,2.0
a hotel wed return to,"we prefer the smaller boutique hotels and were not disappointed the nice size room was very bright clean the bed was excellent and it had a lovely view of michigan ave and skyscrapers beyond the only drawback was was the small bathroom with no vanity space but this was a small sacrifice for the convenient location and cleanliness of the room the ac was quiet and very efficient as well the location of this historic hotel was convenient to many excellent neighborhood restaurants and cafes off michigan ave in addition to being within walking distance to the millennium park and other attractions of that nature 
all in all we would definitely return to this hotel for its cleanliness convenient location friendly and helpful staff and reasonable rates",4.0
the best hotel to stay at in washington dc excellent customer service,my fiancé and i stayed at the comfort inn in downtown dc we checked in september 11 2011 and checked out september 17 2011 this was our first time ever visiting washington dc our stay at the comfort inn was excellent from the first day that my fiancé and i checked in we encountered incredible costumer service the staff at the comfort inn kyle the manager rachelle and kevin went over and beyond the call of duty to make sure our stay in washington was great the hotel was very clean which is very important to me because i am a huge germaphobe they also had complementally breakfast which was great it included eggs bacon sausage toast cereal and much more it was great waking up every morning and not having to worry about where we were going to eat breakfast they also had fresh coffee ice water with lemon in it and fresh hot chocolate chip cookies in the lobby for the guest the hotel was in the perfect location for everything  we drove from atlanta ga which is 700 miles away and during our stay there we did not have to drive our car at all they also had free wifi so you could connect to their internet their rates per night were very reasonable better than any of the other hotels that i researched the valet parking staff kevin was very professional and courteous the next time we go back to washington dc we will be defiantly staying at the comfort inn again i would not stay anywhere else but there i would recommend to anyone who is thinking about taking a trip up to washington dc to stay at the comfort inn in downtown dc you will not disappointed i guarantee it,5.0
many advantages to staying at the tc,the tc has many positive things going for it it is a beautifully landscaped property the grounds are impeccably maintained and the atmosphere is relaxing it is a great place to stay with kids multiple pools plenty of casual dining etc i like a good value and i find it at the tc the rooms do show their age but mine was very clean which is all i care about if you are expecting the ritzcarlton you will be disappointed otherwise you should have no problems also they do have a golf course hey at the time the tc was built it was the premier resort in the areafinally location  location  location the tc has the best location on hotel circle we were in town to see my cubs play the padres the trolley station is directly behind the property so you can get anywhere downtown seaport village petco park the gaslamp it is also a short drive from the zoo and seaworld our car never left the tc parking lotif you have reasonable expectations the tc will probably exceed them it is a very nice place to stay and relax while in san diego,4.0
great value watch for noise,"we stayed a slow weekend in january and got an 80night rate to get a cheap rate look around online for the lowest rate then call the motel directly they will match or beat the best online rate 
this hotel is in a great neighborhood with excellent restaurants and walking distance to presidio exploratorium palace of fine arts etc
the hotel was recently furbished and the room we stayed in was clean and spacious unfortunately our room faced lombard sthwy 101 and the noise is a big factor la luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame this is also a source of cold air we kept the heater on to drone out the noise i recommend not staying in room x01x12 where x is the floor number ask for room not facing street another bummer for me was the bed was very soft albeit spacious and new im used to a firm bed so my back was sore most of the weekend
the front desk help timothy when we were there was very helpful good restaurant recommendations and knew where to find things in general
dont expect much for the light continental breakfast nothing fresh recommend walking two blocks to judys cafe on chestnut st for breakfast they only take cash but good portions of good food",4.0
quiet and safe  whilst in new york,we were recommended to stay at the surrey were glad that we took the advise the surrey is situated on the east side of central park the subway is located a couple of blocks away only a few minutes walk we stayed here for 3 nights at the start of november 11 from the moment we arrived the service was excellent we had no need whatsoever to ask for anything everything was there just the way it should be so for us the room was perfect what is one of the most important things about hotels  the bed well it was perfect as where the various pillow options well be back in new york in 2012 and we will return,5.0
very nice historic hotel,"the best western at pioneer square was a real treat for us staying before and after an alaskan cruise i made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays since the ship arrived back in seattle very early i contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available michael k responded promptly and upon arrival back into seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready the hotel itself is classic history it is centrally located and found that checkin was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained large room with excellent bath and just the right amount of furniture we felt like we were back in the 50 or 60s the room was spotless and very clean as well as the bath we were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay after checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels that was ezekial the rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well the hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel there were lots of choices just not hot meals except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves there is no restaurant in the hotel but many choices near by we ate at an asian restaurant right next door to the hotel julies garden small quaint and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price for a drink near the hotel just next door try thepioneer square saloon the hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like there is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from michael the front desk clerk we used the seattle light rail from the airport for just 250 each way per person saving lots of  vstaxi or shuttle service into seattle 250 each vs taxi of nearly 45000 each way it was so easy to use went to the american idol 2010 tour at key arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert the hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station an easy walk upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from pier 66 to the hotel for a 600 for 2 people to transport our luggage that afternoon we went to safeco field for a ml baseball game mariners vs twins and just walked down the street to the ballpark both qwest field seattle seahawks and safeco field mariners baseball are within walking distance also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic ate dinner the last night at the crabpot on the waterfront alaskan way which was in our opinion very overrated we enjoyed a free bus ride to pike street market saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see room price was an average of 20000 per night a bit pricey for us but well worth it in the end considering we saved lots of  for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier yes i would recommend the best western pionner square for either business of leisure visits lots to do in seattle and a very friendly city only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city feel this is a very bad image for the city of seattle and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up 
for an historic hotel close to many venues consider the best western pioneer square hotel friendly staff that is very helpful you will not be disappointed if we ever do another cruise from seattle we will consider staying here again it was a real treat and a step back in time since it is an historical hotel",5.0
fabulous new york hilton,the hotel is ideally located within new york city not to mention a first class property that is very well maintained and very comfortable however what really distinguishes this facility from others in its class is the extremely accommodating staff from early checkin to late checkout and everything in between they were all warm welcoming and eager to please and that they did,5.0
great service,my husband took me here for my 40th birthday and it was the extra touches that really made our stay here very memorable we had a few issues and the staff and management couldnt be nicer to make up for it they truly went out of there way to make us feel very important the concierge book us in an amazing french restaurant for my birthday dinner which just topped off the great time we had in new york thanks to all of the staff for they did the extra special touches made all the difference we truly enjoyed our stay,5.0
great surprise dont judge a hotel by its lobby,i typically dont let the boyfriend pick the hotels because i tend to be very picky when it comes to stylecomfort when we arrived at the colonnade i was a bit scared the lobby was small and i had a feel of a scary old haunted hotel from movies i was already expecting for the worse but when we got to the room i was very surprised it was spacious modernchic and the bed was very comfortable i definitely didnt think that the rooms would be this nice we had a great view from the room windows from floor to cieling and it was a great location,4.0
we had a great time with our 15month old,well definitely be back great place nestled among beautiful hill country vistas you never need to leave this resort as it has plenty of activities to keep you busy including several restaurants a great selection of swimming pools a room where kids can play and a great spa i didnt play golf on this trip but the green looked beautiful the staff are incredibly helpful and attentive our room was comfy and cleaned well on a daily basis shuttle service is available to six flags and the local highend mall,4.0
modern boutique in a great location,my boyfriend and i stayed at 6 columbus right after nye and we couldnt have been happier it is in a great location but isnt one of those big touristy hotels decor of a hotel is very important to me and 6 columbus was sleek and modern but still welcoming the staff was very helpful and even gave us a complimentary room upgrade so we could stay on the same floor as the other couple we were meeting therebeing in ny and so close to columbus circle we expected the usual city sounds at night i was shocked that we could not hear any noise inside our room i am not exaggerating the room was completely soundproof we are excited to try the rest of the thompson hotels in ny and other cities,5.0
we loved this hotel ,"we loved the hotel  great customer service always met with a nice friendly greeting and a smile when we left or came back to the hotel and the concierge david was the best if he didnt know then noone would know  and above all a great rate for a junior suite 
i had orginally asked for a junior suite with a great view however when we arrived it was raining i was cold and wet and had bronchitus and my other half had the flu so we asked if there was anything available right away so we could get out of our wet clothes and have a hot shower we were given a junior suite right away  no great view but in the end that didnt matter
location
we stayed 10 nights at the affinia dumont in late may  early june as we wanted to be in a neighbourhood which had more of a flavour to where real new yorkers live the hotel is located on east 34th street between lexington and 3rd ave the subway green line is only a block or so away and the good thing about this location is that the station at union square is great for changing to other lines cross town buses were easily picked up  from west to east alight just beyond park ave or at 3rd ave you can also catch a bus to the east river ferry in 34th street too so it is quite a handy location
adjacent to the affinia dumont is a restaurant the barking dog and a baskins robbins ice creamery theres also a thai restaurant and a deli on the corner too opposite the affinia dumont is a duane reade pharmacy and market which is handy if you need to top up medications or other items or see a doctor weekdays only
we bought fruit at the street vendor cnr 34th  3rd ave as his fruit was nicer and cheaper than in the deli  duane reade nice bread as opposed to plastic wrapped varieties can be bought at any of the zabars bakeries in grand central
along 3rd and lexington aves there are many other restaurants and cafes and shops and on some weekends lexington ave has a street fair which runs from 34th to about 23rd street
around 8 or so blocks north of 34th street is grand central station which is easily walkable from the hotel 
theres a bank with a couple of atms on the corner of 34th and lexington too  really the location has everything at your fingertips
the room
our room was a junior suite and had plenty of room and amenities for us it was decorated in dark browns carpet and woods with light grey beiges and light olive green and cream accents we had a double bed and a huge flat screen tv a large desk and a sofa and tub chair our kitchenette had a full size fridge and stove and washing up facilities too our room was nicely maintained by housekeeping and always spic and span when we came back from being out and about
if there was one small critiscm there were no cooking utensils such as eg flips and large spoons suitable for stirring a pot etc and only one large bowl which we used to put fruit in however it wasnt a great concern as we ate out most of the time or brought back cooked food from nearby restaurants  delis after all we were on holidays
laundry facilities
there is a guest laundry in the basement with about 4 machines and dryers as well as a soap dispenser the washing machines take 8 quarters as do the dryers and the soap powder costs 1
internet access
internet access is available throughout hotel and during our stay the cost was 1395 per day i didnt see any nearby cafes apart from one on 28thlexington ave that actually had a notice that free wifi was available and i certainly didnt feel like lugging my notepad around nyc to go to a burger king just to get free wifi the way i figured it was that i could pay 1395 for internet access every now and then or go to a cafe and order a couple of coffees which with tip would probably be similar to the cost of access through the hotel",5.0
exceptional service and friendly helpfulness with charm and style,the sleep inn is one of those hotels that did not have the look or feel like a chain hotel the rooms were spacious and clean it has an ideal location near baltimore convention centers camden yards and the local scenery not only was this hotel was brand new but the service was also impeccable i was really surprised how well run it was if you want to hang out in baltimore this has the ideal location for you to experience what baltimore is really all about,5.0
captured seattle experience,we stayed for three nights over the 4th of july we requested a room with a view and we sure got one we had a lovely view of the harbor from the 14th floor cant say enough about the beauty we had great weather which helped the hotel is convenient to everything the concierge was very helpful and friendly providing maps and good advice we got in late the first night after taking the link from the airport its only a block and 12 from the stop and it costs under 3  cant beat it room was lovely ate at the elephant and castle downstairs which has a happy hour from 10pm on very good very relaxing after a long flight room was very clean and very quiet short walk to pike public market which was a great experience you shouldnt miss but we were surprised by the amount of homelesspanhandlers in the area short walk to monorail short walk to bus tunnel to pioneer square free which we took to the underground tour highly recommend staying here,5.0
the more you pay the less you get,"yes this was a very nice hotel the yard house one of the restaurants connected to the sheraton we found to be exceptionally good and our room was spacious and even had a view of the rockies the downside was we felt that the more we paid the less we got no free wifi no continental breakfast 30 a day just to have your car parked plus this hotel was so enormous you have to go across the street to the other building to use the gym 
not sure if wed be willing to pay so much again but the location is hard to beat you can walk to the capital building downtown shops and restaurants but as long as you dont mind factoring in the cost of the little things that add up this is a hotel worth checking into",4.0
service  attentiveness was terrific,held an annual conference at paradise point this year a great property that offered all the features we needed to hold the event and the service from the staff was outstanding whatever we needed a quick call was all that was needed and it was taken care of catering was fantastic the property offered an nice tranquil setting which was great for the nonbusiness parts of the event and also featured an excellent array of meeting space that lent itself well to the various types of business meetings and functions that took place,5.0
good price bad location,while we got a great rate for two adjoining rooms the hotel is isolated from restaurants and commercial areas good location for visiting the rodin museum and parking was free,3.0
treated like royalty at the palace,my husband and i stayed at the palace to celebrate our fifth anniversary the location is wonderful because it is a block to rockefeller centre and a bit away from the crowded streets of times square the service at the palace is outstanding we had turndown service each night with slippers laid out and chocolate left on our pillows housekeeping was outstanding and even the water pressure in the shower was strong a complaint i usually have in most hotels i cant wait to return back to new york to stay at the palace again,5.0
reasonably priced rooms and a wonderful staff in a great location,this hotel is located between the john hancock tower and shopping on michigan ave and millineum park and the museum campus it is one block from the chicago river and the boat tours and we were able to see the trump tower from our room it was very easy to walk or take a short bus ride to any of the attractions we wanted to visit and the hotel was close enough to return to during the day to take a break or drop off purchases the front desk staff was able to give us great advice about how to get places where to eat and where to buy transit passes the room had a small kitchen and a bedroom with a door which was a nice touch although the sleeper sofa was rather small and we were glad only one of the teenagers was with us the hotel also provides free breakfast all this for a very reasonable price for a room in chicago the only mixup was about parking which i know is always a problem in this area,5.0
great restaurant tucked into this beautiful hotel,"i stayed at the town and country on business all this week  and tonight had the pleasure of eating at one of the restaurants on the premises trellises the food was delicious but what really made it a memorable experience was the outstanding service provided by our waiter don and the bartender craig both gentlemen went above and beyond to ensure that we had not only great service but also a great time they made us feel so welcome i cant wait to go back on my next trip to san diego

great location but,"location and friendly people are the only things this days inn has going for it  if youre going to memphis for the graceland experience then this may be the place for you  its a two minute walk to the graceland facilities wed booked two nights there  we wouldnt have stayed a third
first impression was that lobby area smelled strongly and unpleasantly of bleach but checkin staff were polite and helpful and there was no problem with our reservation lobby sofas were quite badly stained
our room was average size but the door had spillage down the outside and didnt fit very well  looked as if it had been forced at some time soft furnishings were grubby and stained and you wouldnt want to walk barefoot on the carpet 
bedlinen was thin old and cheap looking there were stains on the blankets i didnt want to look under the bed  just had the feeling i might not like what i might find hard surfaces in the bathroom were clean enough but there was mould on the shower curtain towels were small thin and grey the coffee maker and hairdryer didnt work  a helpful and friendly cleaner got the coffee maker fixed but the haidryer was a dead loss the less said about the free breakfast the better
all the people we dealt with were helpful  we had a problem with the bedside lamp and someone came quickly from reception with a new lightbulb overall the place is run down and tacky at the edges and needs a good deep clean and some maintenance 
the famous guitarshaped pool looked clean enough but we didnt try it because the weather was a bit cold
we didnt think it was very good value for money compared to other places we stayed on our trip",2.0
great location,"this hotel is located just 2 blocks away from times square so we just take a short walk there the room is small but adequate for our family of three and its clean the staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful we got in few hours before checkin time but he managed to get us a clean room shortly after we arrived thats really cool
the complimentary breakfast was a normal spread but we love the diy freshlymade waffles my girl and i have fun making a few on our own topping it off with the rainbow loops besides the usual maple syrup and butter its both pretty and delicious yummy
overall its value for money and in great location definitely stay here again if we are back in new york city again",5.0
would not go back,"we recently stayed one night at the days inn after a trip to seaworld this was one of the most economical hotels in the area for that weekend so we booked it the sides of the beds and carpets had stains the bathrooms werent clean really gross actually and we had to go ask for basic items like an ice bucket 
i definitely would not stay again",1.0

amazing hotel and staff,i stayed over nye with friends and had an amazing time the front desk staff was very knowledgable about the hotel and area and appointed an extremely nice room on the 6th floor the room had a great view and more than enough space the sleeping quality was great as well i will definitely stay here again if i am in boston and will recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area,5.0
beware of low rates,"i stayed here in october 2002 having booked over the internet via a reseller and got a really good rate of below 200 dollars 
check in was great but once i got to my room and tried to settle down for the night i quickly discovered i was above the club in the hotel and was kept awake until 4am
fortunately the next day i was moved a floor up but this time i was now above the air con unit in the middle of the hotel  noisy still but at least it was constant droning
i spent the rest of my nights there sleeping with ear plugs  not good

disgusting run down with cockroaches,i unfortunatly had to stay at this hotel for one night as everything else was booked up or very expensive im not a hotel snob and have stayed in perfectly nice 2 hotels in the past i paid 180 on lastminutecom for the night which was ridiculous  it wasnt worth 30 i very nearly packed my stuff up and left to find another hotel no matter how much it cost the room was tiny not exactly spotless and i found hair on my pillow i had a terrible nights sleep as it was so unhomely i packed up quickly in the morning oh and my wake up call was 30 mins late and as i was leaving there was another guest saying he wasnt paying for his room as he had found a cockroach and dumped it out on the counter suffice to say i woudnt recommend staying here under any circumstances  spend a bit more if you have to and stay at a well known hotel or major chain,1.0
good hotel  beware the noise,we just stayed 2 nights at this hotel it was so fun being on the waterfront side watching all the activity in the bay and the cruise shipsbeware rooms 264 and 266 they are over the bar area of the hotel and they have bands on friday and saturday nightloud does not describe what it does in your room they do stop at midnight but if you are trying to sleep before thatyou wont no cups in the bathrooms for rinsing your mouth or drinking the tap waterview is amazing at night from the loungerestaurantservice in lounge area very slowpretty badbut i would go back here knowing what to ask for now,3.0
great downtown hotel,stayed here from oct 6  10 2011 for a wedding it was within walking distance of the venue saving us a lot of time and parking hassles the location is convenient to the alamo rivercenter mall majestic theatre international center and the riverwalk hemisfair plaza and the tower of the americas is a bit more of a hike but doable valet parking was 23day and the crew was great never had to wait long for them to bring the car around room accommodations were excellent the kitchenette was great to have and the bathroom was roomy especially the shower ac functioned almost too well closet was just a tad small but usable great view from our room 507 of the sa downtown skyline could hear just a bit of traffic noise from outside but thats to be expected it didnt disrupt our sleep any full breakfast in the morning was outstanding go for the waffles at night to beat the snack cravings we did buy a few items from the little market thats by the front desk never used the swimming pool or the fitness center so i cant rate those but im sure theyre good other than that i highly recommend this hotel for a stay in downtown san antonio,4.0
service location and a wee bit history,"this was my 16th trip to the states and this could be my favourite hotel the hotel facilities where good everything where it should be it was the level of service and the little extras that push it up the league after trying for 4 days in dc to find a computer or internet shop i noticed 3 computers in the lobby one of which was for printing boarding passes i asked reception how much they cost and was told free i then asked how long it can be used at one time and was asked why i do not use the room wi fi when told i did not carry a computer an i pad was provided for my stay 
add to this cold water on every landing tea coffee and water in the lobby with dispencers offering nuts chips and wait for it mms i pod docking station in room microwave and fridge and room srvice available not only from the 5 star restuarant but 4 local takeaways 
the room was very clean and modern as was the bathroom
this is all organised service but the level of personal sevice was up there to
oh and location chestnut street has everything from macys to the liberty bell and 5 boys burgers very very walkable 
one little thing a 22 dollar cab to pats for a philly cheesesteak not worth it get one local

posh hotel great location,"i have often stayed at this hotel i really like to central location as well as the property it has an cool vibe to it and the staff has always been so nice and accomodating
being a frequent guest the hotel staff have become familiar with me and always give me a warm greeting on my return
i usually opt for the studio or loft suite i like the decor of the rooms the one downside is that it is an older hotel and the walls are a bit thin
the hotel restaurant is also very good i really like their bar and it is a very fun spot on the weekends it is full of a lot of the sf locals and a bit upscale
the location is very nice and centrally located to a lot of great shopping in sf",4.0
an acceptable thanksgiving deal,"i spent thanksgiving weekend in new york for the first time this year my relatives were already booked in more pricey rooms in the times square area as well as in a restaurant in the theater district for turkey dinner so i restricted my hotel search to the same areas for convenience thats why i chose amsterdam court on bookingcom based on my main criteria of location price and trip advisor reviews
i was assigned a room with a partial view of broadway nice i was pleased with the location and the price i paid for it alright and the bed was comfortable and room fairly clean in general perfect unfortunately everything else fell short space was quite tight and was exacerbated by the odd shape of the room one corner of the room was blocked by the tv and the tv stand it was also poorly lighted and the window ac unit noisy breakfast and wifi were extra which i did not avail of i was also surprised that bulky tv sets were still used in big city hotels like this one i did not mind my situation too much because i had a packed itinerary and only used the room to come home to at night after a 2night stay however i decided id look elsewhere next time i come to visit this exciting city",3.0
fair but watch out,this hotel is fair and again like all embassy siutes expect complimentary cooked to order breakfast and evening manager reception the atrium is gorgeous however we were very disappointed in the beddings and service quality my 3 year old son and i came home with bed bug bites on our backs faces necks and legs due to this reason we decided to check out earlier then expected when i brought this disturbing issue to the front desk the manager gave me a weird look and stated they could have charged us for the additional day because we were originally due to check out tomorrow i could not believe my ears and the unprofessional attitude of this staff member i felt they thought that i was expecting to be comp for the room and felt very insulted never again will our family stay at this embassy suites establishment,2.0
nice hotel good location reasonable on the weekends,enjoyed a weekend stay at this location that is well situated near la jolla del mar and the coast the hotel is located off the highway in a small corporate park area the rooms were clean contemporary and comfortable  the staff were gracious and helpful the dining room and breakfast were a bit lackluster as we did not have silverware the buffet was on the lean side coffee running low etc  but nothing huge overall the hotel provided us with a positive stay  we hope to return,4.0
return was not a disappointment,"revisited the hotel a year after our first visitstayed 5 nights and we found the hotel amidst the hustle and bustle of timed square a haven of peace and quietapart from one lady on reception we were treated with courtesy and considerationwe checked in very early and though our room was not immediately availableobviouslywe did get a room very shortlyour room was kept immaculately and the turn down service was good providing clean towelschocolates and complementary bottled water
a very good hotel providing excellent value for moneylook forward to further visits in the future",5.0
great location great price great managers,"we stayed at the hollywood downtowner for our entire week long holiday in la and had it not been for the location of the hotel we would have had a difficult time getting around no one walks in la even the sunset strip people drive the hotel was definatly dated and our room had a funky staledamp smell to it but after a couple of days we didnt even notice the area of the hotel is not the greatest of neighborhoods but if you know that going there then its not a surprise 
the managment were very nice and let us check in quite early as our flight got in before noon we had fresh towels every morning and our beds were made up every day the breakfast was pretty simple but the donuts were very tasty 
there is the metro station under 2 blocks away a ralphs grocery store and a starbucks on the corner as well hollywood blvds walkoffame is within walking distance but we didnt like having to walk so far back when the sun set take the metro 2 stops and youre in the heart of hollywood 
for the price and location this hotel is fantastic we didnt use the pool but it was well used while we were there i will for sure be staying there again on my next visit to la",3.0
we loved it,"we stayed here for a couple of days before heading up to wine country the location is great  very close to a cable car stop lots of restaurant choices in the area and within easy walking distance to pier 39

the evening wine hour is a great touch",5.0
nice but dont depend on the hotel shuttle service,university inn is clean comfortable  quiet only drawback was that the shuttle was not running when i needed it despite earlier reassurance from the hotel staff that i could get a shuttle from the light rail stop to the hotel no offer was made to reimburse us for the taxi ride despite my complaints i had to arrange for a taxi in an unfamiliar city and find a sheltered place to wait for it in the pouring rain wifi for laptop was hard to access so we often had to use the computer available in the lobby instead other than these negatives the staff was very helpful and friendly and we loved the decor and location fun shopping and restaurants a couple blocks away only 2 blocks from the lovely u of wash campus we were there during the 2week period when the huge cherry trees on campus were in bloom  quite lovely our trip to the boeing plant for a tour was a treat too,4.0

in the heart of the action in the magnificent mile,the hotel raffaello is in great location it is close to all the fantastic sites including many great restaurants shopping on the magnificent mile the john hancock center lake michigan the old water tower and the river boat cruises various companies this was a good location for us because i was traveling with my mother she has had ankle replacement surgery so walking long distances was out of the question the staff was very friendly and helpful the weather was very warm over the memorial day weekend so i was thankful for the air conditioning in the rooms my only complaint would be that there were no recycling facilities in the room for water bottles newspapers etc,5.0
best location excellent service incredible property,"the location cant be beat whether in dc for business or pleasure we were just 7 minutes by cab from a meeting near the capitol a four minute walk from super restaurants and a five minute walk to monuments
every staff member was welcoming knowledgeable and service focused our check in and departure was swift and efficient the concierge a wealth of information the bellman quick and remembered me as i came and went
the food enjoyed in occidental grill cafe du park and room service was fresh and perfectly prepared in each location there were creative choices to satisfy a variety of tastes and dietary needs
our room was spacious well appointed and pleasantly decorated it was very clean which is a high priority for us the hallways are cheerful and well lit the lobby with state seals on the ceiling and interesting shops took us back to a grander age",5.0
clean good value nice location but certainly not perfect,"the rooms are clean with new furnishings and the beds are comfortablethe ac works well and the location is convenient the price is also very good for manhattan so fairly satisfactory for the most part

theives,well to start off i spent about 2 weeks visiting los angeles spent alot on time in hotels and let me tell you this i have never been so frustrated i went there for a wedding so we stayed the wednesday night to sunday thursday night the roof top gardenwhich is not on the roof ps was reserved so we couldnt go admire the view the restaurant there was so expensive the bar closed down very early and the worst part of this hotel is that i had stuff stolen from my room i had to call security twice they told me this woudl be taken care of and to not worry before i left the hotel to come back to canada  i checked in at the front desk to see what progress had been made she advised me that they will contact me asap with some news i was so disapointed because i had put all my souvenirs in one bag so that i new where it was at all times and that is the bag that was stolen from my room thats how i knew right away it was missing so i travelled back didnt hear anything for the first little while finaly we got in contact took more info by the end of the conversation my claim had got denied becuase they chose to believe the lies of a staff member other then customer the lies she said did not even make sense the worst part is that she said she saw the bag and didnt touch it the bag was on my bed and the bed sheets had all been changed so how does this make sense ruined my trip had no souvenirs for my family or friends i am not satisfied what so ever i believe something else could have been done i will get my story around to everyone that is thinking of staying here because watch out they are theives,2.0
perfect spot with an amazing view,"just back from a quick trip to chicago loved this hotel to begin with they gave me an upgrade and my room on a high floor had an amazing lakefront view ipod dock nice shower great toiletries and was very well equipped it was actually quite lovely
my only complaint was the valet parking was very overpriced but if your visit keeps you within a view miles of the hotel they offer free accura car service so no rental car needed",5.0
this hotel is amazing,the views are incredible and the staff is very attentive great for families that are traveling the bar is very nice and the staff is on the spot with your drink or food the beds are amazing and super comfy this hotel is also connected to water tower place if you are interested in doing a little shopping also a great location to michigan avenue and the lake front,5.0
not as heavenly as westin should be,"i stayed here for work for three nights upon arriving there was a stain on my heavenly comforter which was promptly taken care of when requested my towels were old and scratchy overnight dry cleaning did not arrive when i was told and when it finally arrived it was not very clean and had to be sent back for yet another day i have come to expect being taken care of at westin i felt like i was the one constantly taking care of these issues during my stay
the saving grace is that the location is great just around the corner from all of the craziness that is times square so theres a bit of quiet while still being in the middle of everything",2.0
best hotel in the city,upon arrival you know you are somewhere special every employee is courteous and knowledgable rooms are amazing bed is so comfy and everything is immaculategreat shower right within walking distance to everything you can imagine including a trader joes across the street definitely will stay here again the next time i am in town,5.0
an outstanding place for fun and rest,my sisters mom and myself just spent a beautiful weekend at thewit in chicago and it was positively the best experience i have ever had with a hotel the staff is exceptional  from the front desk to the valet to bellhops to the restaurant server  across the board the best hospitality service i have ever come across not only were the kind and effecient but they were truly nice and friendly and went out of their way to provide a oneofakind experience the food is also excellent  we ate a delicious breakfast downstairs in state and lake and had an incredible italian meal in the upstairs restaurant i heard the chef had just one some prestigious award for his culinary skills  and it was definitely selfevident thank you wit for a memorable weekend,5.0
a great stay in this timeless hotel,stayed 2 nights prior to our departure from lax was a little dubious as the price was a third of the cost of other hotels we stayed in the westin nearby earlier in the trip and that was excellent but you paid for it we found the travrlodge perfect a convenient location near lax with a dennys next door for a cheap and cheerful meal if you take the time to read the story of the hotel in the folder in the room you will see what a glorious history the hotel has had yes there is road and aircraft noise but personally that sends me to sleep there is no elevator but not the end of the world we paid extra for a pool view and it was lovely free breakfast finishes at 9 which is a little early a special mention for tony the shuttle bus driver really nice friendly guy an assett to the staff,5.0
family fun in california,great experience friendly staff and beautiful rooms my husband enjoyed the tennis courts and my son loved the in room wireless and video games i layed in the california sun by the lovely pool and enjoyed prompt room service every morning beds verycomfortable and the double sinks allowed no fighting for bathroom time free shuttle to universal very convinent highly reccomend as a relaxing and fun retreat,4.0

great location for a great city break,"my partner mother in law and myself stayed in this hotel in april 2011 for 5 nights
first of all the staff were excellent always friendly and asking how we were and giving advice  also remembering my name the entire visit
the rooms as per many comments were quite small the double bedrooms were smaller than the twin ones as we had two rooms they were very clean and nicely decorated also as per other comments there was construction work on our floor or was just finishing throughout our eveningsearly mornings there was a lot of banging and clanging also quite funnily by the end of our trip we got to see the hallway with all lightbulbs and all fittings reattached
all of the above was a slight disappointment as staying in this hotel wasnt the cheapest option however the location made up for most of it our first morning we walked out of the hotel turned right and then left  in front of us was the empire state building which was very impressive just around the corner is the subway as well which came in handy
overall  its nyc so we are biased to say it was a fantastic holiday however we felt the hotel didnt give us the wow factor that the city did",4.0
extraordinary value and great style befitting a great old classy city,we discovered the kp through a very good 2010 fodors guide review liked the descriptions on the hotel web site and reserved a room immediately but the entire experience was much more than we expected particularly the attentive and knowledgeable major domo bob f our room was lovely  beautifully decorated comfortable and quiet the amenities were beyond standard like the nicely appointed bathrooms lighted brass magnifying mirror an unexpected bonus for us was finding an outstanding elks lodge located in the hotel wnich we were able to enjoy as members of another lodge we will definitely return and encourage friends to stay at the kp as well thanks,5.0
friendly front desk clean hotel,we stayed here to go to the ohio state fair and attend a concert this was a very good choice because of the location it is in a safe part of town and only a few minutes from crew stadium and the fairgrounds there are many restaurants and a shopping mall nearby the young men at the front desk are fantastic and really want your stay to be perfect,5.0
average hotel high prices,"very average in comparison to all the w brands nice beds and food nothing else decoration is outdated lobby small not ws best by far they have a nice bar downstairs a guest came over in the room and smoked a ciggarette we were fined a crazy amount 
all in all decent hotel but doesnt go very far on special look further if you looking for special this place is far from",3.0
wonderful stay at 4 point sheraton,"spent 4 days at this gem hotel back in july and totally enjoyed the experience to begin with new york hotels are expensive all year around even for a single room especially during the summer months so when i found out this hotel offers a special rate of 140 a night for a nice double room in the middle of manhattan with free internet included i had to jump on the deal even it is 3 months ahead
location of the hotel is simply unbeatable  in the heart of chelsea between 6th  7th hotel premise is on the quiet w 25th street totally tucked away from the busy traffic so many shops and restaurants around and easy walking distance to subway stations with multiple metro lines e line at 8th23rd st takes you directly to jfk definitely a good base for nyc trips it is a not a new hotel but 4 points did a good job of maintaining the interiordecor updated my room was definitely roomy considering this is nyc and you will pay a premium for space and nicely decorated with two twinbeds work station lcd tv and an ok bathroom couldnt be happier with the space  hotel does come with a nice bar and a restaurant with outdoor seating which i did not use as nyc is filled with great eateries in every neighborhood so its best to explore the dining options outside internet as mentioned is included in the rate but there are two free computer downstairs in the lobby for guest use if you dont have a laptop
many reviews here complained about the front desk staff and service but i did not encounter such problem during my entire stay in fact i considered them pretty ok i guess it all depends on who you ran into maid service on the other hand could have been a bit better but it did not bother me too much
in all this is an above average hotel from the amenities point of view however for the room space you get  if you find a good rate i must say this hotel provides some very good value i have stayed in a number of other nyc hotels with smaller rooms older facilities mediocre service and significantly higher price before all i can say is this 4 point sheraton certainly beats all of them i would definitely return in the future if i can find a special rate again",4.0
it served its purpose well,my travel coordinator made reservations for me to stay here while attending a seminar and i learned the hotel was undergoing major renovations just before i flew out to san jose that combined with some of the online reviews i read made me wonder if i needed to cancel and look for another hotel as it turned out the renovation project had very little impact on my stay since most of the time i spent at the hotel was to study prepare for class clean up change and sleep i had a freshly renovated room which was very clean  functional my bed was comfortable and the wifi access allowed me to stay updated with my local news websites and check email without any issues the breakfast buffet included in my travel package at the restaurant was decent and had a nice variety of fresh fruit in addition to the standard fare of scrambled eggs bacon sausage fried potatoes and french toast the shuttle drivers desk  concierge staff were polite professional and helpful for a business trip it served its purpose well and id stay there again,4.0
shabby chic in nyc,"great location great space great price great people
handily placed for central park and midtown attractions and with several subway lines within a few minutes walk
the one bed suites are huge plenty big enough for the two of us and our two young children 72 for a week
terrific value for nyc the 3 breakfast is a steal
really friendly people  special mention for al the doorman a font of local knowledge
decor is a little on the tired side and there is noise from the busy w57th street  but hey cross the street to duane reades and buy some earplugs
would definitely stay again when in nyc",4.0
living up the hilton name,great location either for business or as a tourist after a long flight from india all that i wanted was a safe and clean place to stay it met the purpose given that it is right next door to macys  empire state you couldnt ask for a bigger room the rooms are very functional concierge desk very helpful and it was right priced i bought about 10 days in advance cant ask for more in nyc,5.0
where to stay if your house burns down,we were in hotel captivity here for 54 days following the witch creek fire in october 2007 very passive aggressive hotel if you asked a question about billing you would get a series of reminder calls asking you to extend your stay at 2 am if that didnt get you they would double your rate saying high inflex of guests even if you had the same rate for 1 month but would send you a gift basket lots of out side noise too the kitchen staff was very very nice and helpful they provided a pretty good breakfast and allowed pets to stay which was a big plus next time the house goes up in flames think we will stay somewhere else,2.0
small but nice,"single rooms in the chelsea star hotel are quite small but painted  equipped nicely and very clean
the noise from the 8th avenue is remarkable but hey its the city that never sleeps ",4.0
the good and the bad,the staff was courteous the price was reasonable the hotel was reasonably clean we had a few bumps in the road the closet in the room was small and had a broken hinge which made using it pointless we had two phones in the room and neither worked we reported this to the front desk and were told someone would fix the problem no one came to fix the problem during our stay the air conditioning would not cool below 73 degrees but most of our stay it was closer to 80 degrees in the room we reported this to the front desk and maintenance did come and reset the thermostat this did not fix the problem and there was no follow up by maintenance to see if the problem was resolved the front desk staff was polite but upon our check out did not question whether we enjoyed our stay or not the price was good but if i were to stay here again i would definitely insist that the basic room functions work appropriately without question the website indicates that this was a brand new hotel in 2009 but it seemed more like a made over hotel,3.0
good value great service and great locale  dated bathroom,"we stayed here for an overnight because we got a great rate  under 200 for a friday night the service was excellent the front desk was nice and very helpful and the bell staff were great 
the hotel is walking distance to almost everything and very near the orange line t at tufts medical campus its also only a 10minute walk to downtown crossing
the hotel is near the boston common theaters newbury street washington street shopping and chinatown you can also walk to the north end in about 20 minutes
the rooms are good sized for the city but the bathroom was a bit small and dated  lots of cultured marble and a small toilet but everything was very clean
if you are in the market for a good location and a clean and comfortable room id check this out its not luxurious but it was a great place for the price we will stay here again",3.0
not what i expected from sheraton,"on arrival at this hotel  our room we were surprised  disappointed by the presentation of our room
we were greeted by condoms in a draw food crumbs around the waste bin  a large clump of hair in the bottom of the shower the room obviously hadnt been serviced properly
to be fair on bringing it to the attention of the duty manager we were immediately shifted to a different room",3.0
very charming,my family of 6 stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and it was extremely nice for the money we were greeted by gretchin who always was perfect to help us with any driving directions or suggestions throughout our stay we were also given sparkling fruit juice upon check in which was very tasty our room was 106 and had new carpet and was spotless it was also very large which was needed for our 4 teenagers 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms were fantastic it was my daughters graduation trip and they actually had a gift for her ready in the room very nice i would have given a perfect score but the air conditoner and electricity in the room had problems but they did make sure for the second night we had nice new fans blowing in our rooms which they had to go and purchase and assemble they also mailed a postcard waiting for us when we arrived home thanking us for our stay more than expected is what this hotel does i would definately recommend this hotel for its location size of suites customer service and cleanliness great great hotel,4.0
great locationelevators an issue,"the hotel allerton is a in a great location you are within footsteps of the magnificent mile if you are looking to be in the heart of the city then i would recommend this hotel my room was tiny but i wasnt planning on spending too much time in it because the hotel is old the elevators are small and i believe that 3 of the elevators were broken that meant that you had to wait 5 minutes for the elevator to arrive and when it did you had to cram into it with other guests it almost became comical ask about the elevators before you book breakfast was pricey45 for frittatas and coffee but not bad the prices are typical for hotels in this category there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel that are more economical i did not feel that the hotel and its staff went out of its way to make us comfortable or treat us like valued guests i would not go out of my way to stay here again 
ps the beds were very comfortable",3.0
exceeded my expectations,"when travelling on business i prefer hotels with kitchen facilities so booked this as it was reasonably close to work i normally consider residence inn comfortable but dont particularly look for them over other brands it just so happened this was closest to work with the room facilities i like
i really enjoyed this hotel it is pretty new so feels clean and fresh the staff were very helpful in advising local restaurants and the facilities were excellent complimentary breakfast was good with a decent selection if a little samey after 2 weeks the gym was reasonable and pool a decent size there is an attached marriott courtyard with a bar if you need a beer although the managers reception mon to wed has a selection of beers and wine
the wifi access was free and resonably fast but tended to slow down in the evening  just the numbers accessing it i guess 
overall this was an excellent hotel at the price not a 5 hotel but 5 for what it gave at the price  recommended",5.0
excellent hotel great location value for money,"i stayed here with three friends in one room in october 2008 we stayed for 4 nights  we had a room with two large i think queen beds the room was big enough for the 4 of us and the bathroom was very spacious  clean 
the view was good and the location very handy i have stayed in new york before at the roosevelt in madison which was also good see review
the only downside to this hotel is no kettle in the room for us brits wanting tea  the hotel breakfast is so expensivebut there is a coffee pot in room  so many cheap breakfast places around the corner it doesnt matter we particularly loved the large delicant remeber the name but it had a huge selection  very reasonable
the hotel had out free cookies most days  if you go up to the level with the computers there are free coffeemilk sachets i think the computers were free too so we booked our seats home
the hotel had our private very nice airport taxi booked at 400am for our return flight  were more than halpful during our stay
overall we loved our stay  the hotel was really rather good",4.0
familyoriented hotel than businesstravelers,"this is my first time staying at the embassy suites in la jolla it wasnt the first choice nor it was out of faint of the heart however i will admit the loyalty program pays
most of the business travelers pick their stay based on the location i am no exception however keep in mind that the location of the hotel isnt a tourist hotspot although la jolla is about 10 miles to the west and the major tourist attractions are down south what surprised me is that there are a lot of families here which translates into lots of kids
guests aside the hotel is clean modern and very guest friendly free breakfast 2hour free drink daily what else can you ask
i stayed in the executive suite upon checkin i was greeted by if not one of the most friendly staff ive ever met prompt service and makes me feel like a valued guest all the way the room is very clean nicely lay out and make me feel like home
now if you staying here on a weekend or peaktourist periods you will hear kids door closed or not some running some screaming but if that bother you or not is up to you
the bedroom on the other hand is like a standard hotel room but upgraded ceilingtofloor window comfortable bed and sheets however if your room is facing the streets prepare to hearing some car noises also the ac unit can be loud in my case it actually woke me up when it kicked in however you can always keep it running to combat the outside noise but its louder than comfortable level to sleep soundly if you are a light sleeper
over all i suggest this hotel to those who wants to get a suite but dont want to pay an arm and a leg for it however some noise problem might be important to those who likes peace and quiet this hotel is more suitable for families than businesstravelers",4.0

good city hotel,"we reserved a regular room at a travelzoo advertised discount at the hotel website and opted for an upper level room upgrade if one were available upon arrival 9 extra only im not sure what the other rooms are like but our room on the 32nd floor was huge clean expertly appointed in a sleek modern style and generally fabulous for the price we paid we had a chaise lounge by the window that looked out towards the river and a very large flat screen tv the bathroom had a separate shower and tub and the toiletries were miller harris i docked the ipod in one of two different systems in the room and put on some music to celebrate with
check in and check out via computer were seamless and the ladies behind the desk were helpful and efficient and with lights streaming down onto the floor the checkin counter is striking and fun
the bed was comfortable not heavenly but still great amenities expected were convenient including ironing board iron and safe the minibar is a fridge so if its not locked you can take stuff out for the night to make room for whateveryour own drinks or meds or a dessert for later wifi is available for a fee and theres no pool hey its the city and there is a nice spa downstairs if you havent already spent all your money shopping on state st if you have a few minutes try the free dance lessons and yoga sessions on the tv preferably with the curtains open really when you see the yoga folks dancing around in the desert youll remember this review
aria the restaurant downstairs is not the best choice especially since you are in a city filled with great places to eat save yourself the time and money and go to another place more worth it

beautiful suites after renovationbut paperthin walls,i stayed at the staybridge after booking a room through priceline at 50 per night room was very clean and quite spacious nice brunch included in price friendly staff persons who actually called me at my room to ask me how everything was so far free highspeed internet my only complaint is that you can hear everything from your adjoining neighbors walls my neighbor had his tv on all night long i called the front desk and they sent security to his room quickly sure enough i could clearly hear security knock on his door and hear him say hello hello he did turn down the tv for awhile but in about an hr turned it back up in all fairness to staybridge i am a light sleeper and they did try to get him to quiet down i cant imagine what the noise would have been like if this person had decided to have a party at his room if they added insulation to the walls this would be the perfect place to stay bring your white noise machine if youre a light sleeper,4.0
pretty nice but probably not worth the full price,i stayed here for a conference and it was a nice place at the discounted conference rate 125night but the more than 300 that they want as a regular thing would have been much too expensive i was given a room in the old part of the hotel this was both good and bad the bathroom that so many people have complained about was actually quite large larger than the one in my apartment and had an enormous window overlooking the flower garden the room itself was very comfortable the hotel advertises bottled water and a robe in the room and in 5 days i didnt get either a colleague who had a room in the newer part got both of those things but had the tiny bathroom so i guess i probably had the better deal i could get bottled water for 149 a gallon at the market across the street though the refrigerator didnt really keep it cold the old part of the hotel is down a long hall from the main lobby and meeting rooms so i had an extra long walk each day the old part of the building also overlooked the sidewalk where the people protesting the democratic rules committee meeting started shouting and blowing whistles at 830 am and also overlooks as i mentioned the flower garden where it seems that people like to sit and drink and be loud late at night i agree with the people who say that for the price they should provide free internet access in the rooms rodeway inn does it in their 40night rooms surely this place could too as another reviewer mentioned there is a subway stop right outside the hotel but you have to climb a steep hill to get from the subway to the hotel which is kind of a pain when dragging a heavy suitcase after taking a bus and two trains to get there from bwi all the public areas and meeting rooms were far too cold it was only in the low 80s outside we really didnt need artic air conditioning dont bother eating at the hotel they are very overpriced and there are lots and lots of restaurants from pizza and sandwiches to italian indian lebaneese mexican baskin robbins afgan thai and chineese within a block and half dont even think about using room service unless you have money to throw away i looked at the menu and it was possible to spend over 30 on breakfast if you include the tax 4 fee and 22 service charge which if you didnt notice this in the fine print you might give the waiter an additional tip on the whole it was a positive experience and i would probably stay there again for 125night but not for 350night,4.0
great business meeting location,"i stayed here for a week in february and the place is absolutely fantastic the meeting rooms were emaculate the food served during breaks was also excellent big bowls of raspeberries blueberries and blackberries and the only thing i could pick them up on was that the boiling water was sometimes just hot 
they have a fantastic gym  pool with a basketball court and climbing wall 
i highly recommend",5.0
nice roomsbut,the hotel is not bad the rooms are actually very ncie quite big and comfortable but the service was not adequate at all awe satyed 4 nights and had to change our room after the first night as we santed aking size bed and not 2 queen eah time we went to the reception for some information the girl wouldnt recognize us the concierge wasnt helpful at all when we asked some adivse for restaurants and parking sapce for one night was soooo expensive i mean the room is nice only air conditionig was too loud but dont expect too much from concierge and reception and wifi only at the reception,3.0
the best hotel i have ever stayed at,"wow what a firstclass place very charming and modern you really feel like you are in a decent newer hotel in vegas like planet hollywood or ti everyone was super nice and attentive from the valet to the door menwomen to reception and housekeeping from checkin on it was a wonderful experience they offered to upgrade me to the concierge level in an executive corner suite but i preferred the layout of the luxury suite so i asked to please keep my original reservation i did not realize that i would have been on the 17th floor instead of the 8th with free breakfast but i liked my luxury suite 
 we had a corner suite room 801 this room was very nice and modern 3 tvs including one in the bathroom mirror 2 bathrooms one with a giant soaking whirlpool tub the only downside of the room is there was no fridge the inroom vending is what your fridge is no room to put your own things in we had to fill our little sink with ice to keep our wine cold
bed was soft a little too soft but big and the linens were very comfortable i hate scratchy cheap bedding so this was an added perk but all in all the room was exactly what i hoped for an area with a full couch and coffee tables another table with two chairs by the window and a desk with two chairs by the window by the bed we were very impressed and felt the price was worth it fyi they are running a special until the end of the year we got this suite for 150 off of the normal price email me if you want the code
casino was bunk tight slots crowded tables we did enjoy chillin out at the you me drink lounge had a little luck with video black jack
we also tried the buffet pallet for those that are not aware this casinohotel is brand new mgm had a temporary casino for years and the only dinning option was the buffet and a small cafe my husband and i loved this buffet it was a little pricey but the food was always topnotch and plentiful well when they opened the new buffet they lowered the prices a little and the quality of the food as well there did not seem to be as many choices and the food stations are way spreadout the asian cuisine was the highlight not much else that i found to be appetizing i think the purposely lowered the prices so people that want to spend a little more will go to one of the expensivo restaurants bourbon steak house and salt water which the entrees were around 3550 each this is just my conjecture but one fact is the buffet quality went down from the old casino
loved this place i will stay here again and eat elsewhere in detroitmany many other options",5.0
fantastic as always,just got back from a weekend at the palmer house once again from rasha and the rest of the crew at the front desk to ernest up at the executive lounge our time was superb kudos to the palmer house as they consistently exceed our expectations we have been going about 6 times a year for the last 8 years and have always had a wonderful time clean rooms great food fantastic service and a great location in my book cant be beat,5.0
perfectly situated for moscone conventions,"the marquis is the hub for many conventions and has wonderful hustle and bustle in the lobby when a large show is in town the rooms are quiet and easy to get to this hotel is very near bartmuni and cable cars and practically connected to the moscone center there is a starbucks in the lobby and a target store across the street just opened movie theaters and restaurants also inside targetmetreon adding to the excellent locale of this hotel
tips when a convention is ending for the day the cab line is very long you can probably talk to the bellmanconcierge and get a towncar to take you anyplace in san francisco for 40 bucks",5.0
a good valueformoney option in a welllocated area,in the past ive stayed nearby at the other expensive copley square district hotels marriott etc but this time i was on vacation with the family in tow and so had to compromise on price it turned out to be a good decision although the hotel is charmless our two double bedded room was a reasonable size and comfortable the outdoor pool was great for the kids and the location is very near to the copley square mall 3minute walk we didnt have breakfast so cannot comment,4.0
swanky hotel with great service,"not only is this hotel visually stunning but the staff at the front desk and the door are spectacular i stayed here in august and i wish i would have written names down so i could give them the individual compliments they deserve there is a gentleman at the front desk with glasses that was always very helpful and nice the doormen are all very attractive not that it makes a difference just an observation room service  the food delivered was all very delicious its expensive but its new york city so i expected it i only have one bad thing to say and that is in regards to the pool attendant she was so lazy and would stand behind her podium readingstudying most of the time and would even let you know thats what she was up to she had no regard for getting clean towels and two of the days i spent at the pool she ran out of towels there was also a bit of a service issue at the pool even when it was slow
i would totally stay here again i felt at home the whole week and all of my crazy demands were always made with kindness",5.0
perfect parking and shuttle to dia,if you need a hotel in denver for an early morning flight then this is the hotel for you we used the park and fly and were able to leave our car at the hotel instead of using the parking at dia which was much more expensive shuttle service to and from the airport was on time and perfect at checkin we were offered fresh cookies hot chili cake yogurt fruit and drinks that was very nice country inn also has a library that you can take the books and return them to any other country inn when you are done hands down a perfect hotel to stay at for your 6am flights out of denver,5.0
from beginning to end a experience,stayed 4 nights on business and everything was beyond expectations from the front desk assisting me with packages and copiesto the free shuttle to the convention centerto the super clean room and delicious breakfastthe stay was wonderful and ill definitely be back,5.0
great service great location great hotel,"we had a great five day stay a coupla months ago the service is great rooms well appointed and nice location near central park we especially liked the redone outdoor area which is oh so trendy but a lot of fun the people were nice the pool is adequate tough to find a pool in nyc and sauna etc well above average
seems like a boutique hotel and i have stayed there twice this year and plan a few more stays if you are pinching pennies this is not the place for you with 22 cocktails and 60 parking ate at bice and botega del vino resturants nearby the restaurant was empty and pricey with just ok food the salon de ning bar has some finger foods so a better choiceperfect on a summer night
all in all a great experience",5.0
price good on priceline but would not recommend for more than one night,"positive location it was in the heart of downtown and only a few blocks away from michigan ave shops cleanliness
negatives again rooms extremely small  we are talking about really small if you have more than one person staying with you i wouldnt recommend staying more than one night as the cramped quarters gets old very quickly there is hardly any space to put your suitcases especially if you have more than one person in the room can hardly move around in room 
hallways and elevators are extremely small could barely walk two abreast in hallway and rooms are extremely close together and not well insulated could hear everything going on in hallway and also could hear loud traffic outside window 7 floors down 
rooms did not have coffee maker people at front desk snooty when we asked if we had king size bed thought we had reserved room with king sized bed but were told rather snotty that they didnt have any king size bed rooms available 
would not want to stay here again",2.0
warm friendly atmosphere in century city,i went to la to visit my brotherinlaw who lives in century city he has such a small apartment that my family couldnt all stay with him so we stayed in this courtyard inn it was a very nice property the bistro is excellent we ate every breakfast there and the service was very good location is great in that it was on a major street and easy to get to the expressway i found my room to be updated and vry clean i have no complaits,5.0
centrally located almost posh hotel,"i booked this hotel through expedia via the 40 option where you dont know the hotel name until after booking 
the hotel is ideally located between magnificent mile and millennium park home of the bean steps away from the river and next door to the house of blues i arrived really early in the day and was pleasantly surprised to find my room ready so i was able to check in at 9am as check out was not until noon the following day the central location of the hotel provided a wonderfully central location to walk to all of the chicago attractions i wanted to visit it is also close enough to the el that i was able to get myself to and from the airport with my luggage by walking from the transit stop to the hotel luckily weather was on my side and not raining at the time as it was a 10min walk with luggage
the hotel tries to be posh with fancy furniture and decorations the room and bathroom were spacious the bed comfortable and a safe provided in the room however there was no hair dryer free wifi or information in the rooms about hotel amenities the wifi issue was a bit of a pain but with the number of starbucks locations nearby purchasing a coffee for use of the internet once a day was cheaper then the cost at the hotel 
although this hotel was in a great location i likely would not stay here again there are so many other hotel options in chicago",3.0
marriott courtyard a good choice,very nice hotel and got a great ratetraveled with spouse and extended family with two little ones we had adjoining rooms and were very comfortable beds a bit firm for my taste and the room a bit stuffy starbucks in lobby was convenient and courtyard was nice for eating breakfast we parked on the street which was great,4.0
great start to the us,we stayed at the handlery union square for the first night of our us trip we were given every consideration warmly welcomed and given a quiet room in order to recover from a long plane trip the location was great the service was personal and welcoming and we could not have been happier with our choice of accommodation thankyou,5.0
great location hotel okay,we stayed here over the valentines weekend 2004 we went with our 7 year old daughter after reading the reviews on here i was dreading it to say the least we arrived at 4pm and we where checked in within 5 mins by very polite staff our room was on the 8th floor it was dated looking but the room beds and towels were clean we had hot water and a place to sleep as a parent i would not tke my child anywhere unsafe or unclean the location was fantastic the staff were great and the staff in lindys downstairs were lovely basically i think you get what you pay for and i would liken it to a travel lodge in england so get on and enjoy new york yourre not there to stay in your room,3.0
very clean and a great staff,on a recent business trip to houston i had the opportunity to stay at best western plus inns and suites in downtown houston the rooms were clean updated and spacious i have been in big name hotels that were not even close to being as nice as the room at best western plus the staff is over the top friendly and customer oriented if you have business in downtown houston you cant go wrong staying here,5.0
loved the muse,spent the weekend in nyc with my 2 daughters ages 14 and 10 and we loved the muse the location is awesome we spent time in the upper east side midtown radio city times square and the village never felt like we traveled far to get anywhere our room was really nice too decent space for a new york hotel room and a very nice bathroom and i loved the fact that the comforter was actually wrapped in a sheet so that each guest had a clean comforter cover everyone was friendly and accomodating as well well be back soon  and definitely stay here again,5.0
great stay,absolutely fabulous amazing stay all staff we encountered went out of their way to assist us bellmen front desk clerks everyone was really great the room was great the view was incredible even left us a complimentary bottle of chardonnay in our room this place is a wonderful place to stay,5.0
expensive but worth it,"we had a very pleasant stay at the hotel for 5 days we spent the extra money on getting a times square view and were given a room on the 42nd floor however due to a family member with fear of heights it took less than 5 minutes from we got to the room until we were offered another room on the 14th floor the hotel was very considerate and helpful with this and in fact being on the lower floors was an advantage now we got to see the duffy square and the people on it instead of just looking on the billboards right in front of the window on the 42nd floor
we had a room with two comfortable double beds the room was very spacious and wellequipped with furniture bathroom was big and in good shape the room was very clean
only downside was the extremely expensive internetservice and just a headsup if you buy it once they will charge you repeatedly every day without asking for confirmation the staff was however understanding of this problem and removed it from the bill immidiately
the staff was very helpful and the concierges had a lot of good suggestions for more uncommon sights in the city and restaurants the view the bar on the 48th floor is worth a visit",5.0
comfortable and convenient,we were in san diego on a combined business and pleasure trip the location was perfect for both purposes the hotel was very comfortable nicely designed furnished and maintained and had appropriate amenities staff was helpful we had only one complaint at this level of hotel and pricepoint we found it unacceptable that the hotel charged for internet accesseven in its business center much lowerend hotels provide free internetwireless access and we certainly would expect more from a higherend hotel,4.0
perfect for service and for families,"first let me preface that i am a platinum member at starwood and have stay at many hotels around the world
this hotel by far is probably one of the best hotels i stayed here are some simple reasons
1 greeted by every staff member they used the ritz carlton approach to say good morning or good evening if within 10 feet of me nice touch staff interested in always helping me out
2 pool one of the only indoor pools with an outside deck to view the city this alone is great after a day in nyc
3 room very clean and modern great amenities from soap to shampoo
4 location i think the video on their website said it best they are the 10 minute hotel 10 minute walk from almost everything in nyc you need to see
to give you some additional information i came here with my family on business and they felt very comfortable i travel to nyc from boston about once every two weeks to stay for the last 5 years so i know nyc pretty well and would recommend this for business or pleasure",5.0
great location amazingly comfy beds,"we stayed at this hotel last autumn but ive only just got around to writing a review that should be no slur on the hotel at all its a great place and we got it at a brilliant price through a uk travel agent
cant comment on the food because we didnt eat there but there are a plethora of diners and restaurants to eat in around and about there is a pretty good indian place just down the street the food is good but its a bit pricey the red flame diner next door is ok i wasnt overly keen but its cheap and easy enough to get to take a wonder off some of the side streets in and around times square and youll find loads of places serving all kinds of food  the fix prix menus are brilliant value
the subway is an easy walk from the hotel in times square and you really cant beat this hotel for location as for the hotel itself we found the staff helpful and friendly the room was always clean and tidy and we had no problem with the size of our room or bathroom yes its not massive but youre in a hotel in a city and its way better than youd get in london or any other european city for the price if i had to say one thing that was slightly annoying there are only 2 lifts so occasionally youd have to wait that said we spent 5 nights here and it was never an issue all in all the algonquin gets 2 thumbs up from us",4.0
highly recommended,"we spent 4 nights in fitzpatricks grand central and were very impressed we arrived early for check in but there was a room available however the receptionist offered us the choice of a bigger room which wouldnt be ready for another hour and gave us vouchers for complimentary drinks in the bar while we waited
the room was gorgeous spotless and spacious enough for two of us and three suitcases the bed which had a canopy overhead was extremely comfortable we had a corner room with two windows which meant we had a view of both 44th and lexington although there isnt much to see on either noise was never a problem from the street
the bathroom was supplied with plenty of toiletries and towels and was very clean and new looking as someone who is obsessive about cleanliness i really couldnt fault this hotel the tv had about 50 channels with pay per view movies and internet also available coffee making facilities iron and ironing board and even an umbrella were all supplied the only problem was the aircon which we couldnt figure out how to adjust so the room got quite cold at times however i never got round to asking about the controls and it really didnt bother us that much
all the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the location is just perfect for visiting the city just minutes from grand central station i would definitely return here and have recommended it highly to everyone i know",5.0
mostly very good,our family enjoyed a long weekend in chicago and a comfortable stay at the embassy suites downtown lakefront  and appreciated being upgraded to a larger corner suite following inquiry upon arrival like many we seek out embassy suites when traveling with the kids as you cant beat the suite rooms free breakfasts managers receptions and atrium space there are 2 embassy suites in downtown chicago very close to each other and i ultimately chose this one based on its 2008 remodel although nothing that follows spoiled our stay here are my gripes having paid about 200night 1 the bathroom needed maintenance and housekeeping the curved shower curtain rod was so loose that the curtain wouldnt stay closed on either end grout along the top of the tub appeared moldready floor tile never sparkled tub faucet was loose light bulb was out for days toilet paper dispenser placement required you to be a contortionist to access it and the absence of any venting fogged up the entire suite during showers leaving visible moisture everywhere and 2 despite the es website touting new flatscreens in the living room areas we had an old tube tv 3 we waited over an hour for an extra blanket and pillow to be delivered for the kids sleeping on the pullout sofa 4 our food tray from room service dirty dishes sat out in the hall for 2 days 5 the chlorine was too strong in the tiny pool 6 the bar sink faucet was loose 7 creamer packets for coffee werent always replaced 8 and there were never enough hand towels there are 3 separate inroom sinks still we rate es chicago downtown lakefront very good  and a little more attention to the details would have earned it excellent ps cheers to the hardworking bar staff during the nightly managers reception,4.0
great location,my friends and i spent a daynight in baltimore in october this hotel was fine for us and the location was really good we checked in sat morning and then walked over to the galleria at inner harbor that was only about a 15 minute walk spent the day shopping and then walked back towards the hotel and stopped at the irish barrestaurant right around the corner from this hotel for happy hour had dinner at a wine bar right down the street from the hotel and then walked up to fells point for a night of drinks although we didnt spend much time in the room we had no issues and when we did have a room key issue the front desk employee didnt hesitiate to walk us to our room to fix it,4.0

this place was 95 with tax formula one weekend,every other place was either booked or gauging folks thanks you customer service was good and staff was friendly room was fine love the refrigerator and kitchen utensils etc wifi worked well easy access to the highway twenty minutes to downtown very pleased with the stay,5.0
all they can do is say iam sorry but not willing to fix the problem,"this is the first review i have ever written for something and i have put this off for several months but with enough consistent bad service i feel it is time to share my experience with crowne plaza in austin tx my husband has stayed at this hotel at least once a month for the past year and on many trips i join him amazingly this hotel has had some sort of problem each and every time we have stayed there there has not been one visit that went without problems not one we are always here on business therefore we do not get to choose the hotel my husbands employer through a local hospital gets a business deal with this particular hotel and the arrangements are always made for us therefore we do not get a say in where we stay otherwise obviously we would not continue to return to this hotel the problems we have faced have included reservation problems such as 1 not having the employer credit card info on file reservation is always faxed in on a hotel form and us being required to give a personal card in order to checkin this has then caused a large freeze on our debit or credit accounts until they can get it worked out and we can have our cc company unfreeze our accounts 2448 hrs later 2 our reservation being for the wrong period of time not enough nights the wrong type of room if we requested two beds as we did for the one trip when we brought along our son 3 being locked out of our room because the reservation ended a day early with all of our belongings in our room there have also been times we have had actual room problems such as 1 ant infestation 2 no hot water 3 no air conditioning 4 no wifiin fact there was one visit in which we moved rooms 3 times before we got into a room that had both hot water and ac and that ended up being the room that had ants
we keep thinking surely this will get better but it has not the staff generally wants to make things right and offer a key card into the executive lounge to get food or a free drink coupon for their bar this is a nice gesture but honestly it would be so much better if they just got it right the first time 
i will say the staff in the executive lounge are fantastic and the housekeeping staff is also really great the concierge who sometimes is in the lobby to greet guests is really nice as well but i am not impressed at all with the front desk and reservations staff i simply dont understand why its so difficult to get a hotel reservation correctat least once in 1215 visits i sure wish we could stay somewhere else and we have tried to get it changed if you are coming to austinnorth austin go to the embassy suitesits just down i35 a bit and my husband has stayed there and loved it",1.0
location suited our needs,"we stayed at this hotel especially to go to olvera street we booked a hire car which we picked up at union station which is right across the road from the hotel we arrived after a 14 hour flight and where able to book straight in at 1000am which was appreciated 
we booked over the internet on the days inn site my biggest praise is that they only charged us for 1 nights accommodation and they could have charged us for 2 nights 
our room was clean and tidy staff where good we found a great thai restaurant just to the rear of the hotel but i wouldnt go walking around this location a night we managed to get a pizza delivered to the hotel in the evening no problems",4.0
great location great value amazing staff,"stayed at four points soho from dec 17 09 to dec 21 09
was our first time staying in new york city and we were traveling under a tight budget decided on this hotel for the price and location to be honest after narrowing it down it was between hotel mela in at 6th and 44 or this one and we were definitely glad we chose four points  we visited the hotel mela lobby and checked out the location  
the rooms were so clean at four points and the hotel looked newmodern my girlfriend is a freak for the clean so i had to be careful which hotel in nyc i was choosing let me tell you that if she thought this hotel was clean youre going to think that its clean starbucks coffee in the room sweet iron hair dryer modern washroom very clean and comfortable beds great climate control view is ok 
staff are amazing you get the feeling they really love what theyre doing no better staff in nyc to start your day with and to come home to they greet you with a smile every time to pass the lobby and were so helpful to us in giving us directions and answering any of our questions about ny
walking distance to soho shops restaurants convenience store liquor store starbucks deli and when going out to see the city it is a 2 min walk north to the red subway line and less than 5 mins walk to the blue line at 6th and spring once youre on the subway you can get anywhere within 1015 minscentral park times sq brooklyn bridge msg and 8 a day gets you unlimited access to the subway deal wouldnt want to stay in the central area times or midtown since it looked way too busy and noisy just cant relax to that
one tip if youve decided to stay here is not to visit the restaurant or bar unless you have money to burn like i said the soho restaurants are within walking distance around prince st or broadway and the liquor store is at prince and 6th",5.0
omgworst hotel u can imaginenastiest most ghetto place y can stay in,seriously do not stay here at alli booked my stay online and when i got to my room there was trouble since i stepped inlong story shorteverything was filthy and my nonsmoking room smelled nothing but cigarette smokethe ceiling to bathroom was falling no phone no iron everything was oldi would have rather stayed in my car but theonly reason i didnt was the people staying here seem to be living permanently and were always outside and it was scaryhow can people live or stay in thia horrible placei will never stay here againi have learned my lesson,1.0
nice but cant we update,the adolphus is a lovely hotel theres no denying that it has oldworld charm that is very rarely found in the usa particularly out west and the food is fantastic the lobby is elegant the staff is very friendly my friends and i kept wondering though when we got to our room  why so shabby we got upgraded to an executive suite very spacious fantastic beds but then  though there was marble in the bathrooms the toilet was a beige 1980s monstrosity with hard water stains and a roach made its presence known there additionally because the executive suite has a couch area the television was halfhidden behind a roomseparation pillar making viewing from bed problematic i understand that is the allure  the oldschool styling but ive been to europe ive been to the east coast their hotel rooms still smell clean not musty and they know when to paint over the plaster patches on the wall and polish the chrome in the elevators i honestly dont know if id stay there again but it was nice this once,3.0
very beautiful in lobby,"the lobby is beautiful  great location rooms were clean and safe environment
have to pay for wifi
had to get the room keys rekeyed 4 times during our short visit a couple times it was just from the front desk to the room and back to the front desk
the room had no heat the first two nights in dec the heat was finally fixed for the 3rd night it was so hot we had to open the windows the temp was not adjustable from the room 4th night no heat again
each day they cleaned they took the towels even though they were hung up and didnt need exchange yet they didnt leave us towels to replace the ones they took we had to call for towels and wait about an hour to get them 
coffee was not replaced each day either we had to request coffee 
each time we called the operator for a request we had to wait a long time just for them to answer the line",3.0

above expectations,i recently stayed at this hotel with a friend the hotel staff was fantastic the hotel is centrally located the concierge steered in the right direction for fantastic locations for night life the room was clean and more than we had expected when booking the hotel the booking agent was incredibly friendly and efficient we were given a bigger room that we had originally booked as a surprise on account of the occasion we were there to celebrate for the staff surpassed what i had asked for i have recommended this hotel to my friends and colleagues and will definitely stay here when in boston again,5.0
a great hotel,we stayed here for three nights midjanuary 2006 we arrived a couple of hours early but our room was ready which was great we were on the 18th floor with a view of the next door office building and new york rooftops  it was fine we woke to light snow on our second day in new york which was fun coming from australia  even though it was very cold out the hotel is well located near two subway stations and within walking distance of lots of attractions we caught the subway when it was two far to walk hotel staff were great very friendly and helped with directions and recommendations for dinner there are lots of places to eat in the street and in the nearby streets continental breakfast was included and it was very good as other reviewers have indicated the hotel lobby and rooms are small but that didnt really seem to matter nice feeling to the place and wed definitely stay there again,5.0

the entire hotel is great,my husband and i stayed at the omni for one night on march 10 2006 this was our second trip to the omni we arrived and used the valet parking and they were very fast and very nice upon checking into the hotel the front desk was very friendly and welcomed us to the hotel our room was wonderful and after waiting about 5 minutes our luggage arrived and they put everything in the right spot the view was of downtown indianapolis it was great the room was very nice with the regular amenities and the beds were nice and plush we decided to eat in the room for dinner the food menu is that of the restaurant hot tuna hot tuna looked very nice at night with the blue light ceiling the food was great filet mignon cooked to perfection we were so glad that we were able to eat in our room and not have to go out to another location and pay the same price for the same food there always seemed to be some type of management in the entry of the hotel they made sure that we didnt need anything and they were very friendly they also came by and adjusted our clocks so we would be ready for the time change the sunday brunch at hot tuna was very good it was about 16 dollars but they had everything and that included your drink they also serve starbucks in the coffee house we called to get our luggage taken down and to check out of the room they arrived within 3 minutes and got all of our bags by the time we took the elevator down and turned in our room keys our entire vehicle was packed they put everything where it belonged we were so impressed they even put our newspaper up front for us to read they were very nice and made sure we had directions to where we were going i would definitely recommend this hotel for a nice occasion or everyday travel they were very helpful when we were looking for things to do around the city too if you need a nice place to stay that is very accommodating this is the place they made us feel so good we didnt want to leave,5.0
will never stay here again,"upon check in the staff was very slow and when we finally made it to the front of the line there was some sort of issuse because we booked through a third party also known as a travel agent and as far as i know that is a pretty common occurance so i was little annoyed by their lack of knowledge in third party transactions when we got to our room i was dissapointedthe front room area smelled heavily of unrine and i didnt want my 2 small children touching anything in the room the first night of our 3 night stay in this hotel was horrible i woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of water running when i turned on the light i discovered the sink in the room was backing up and getting gross water all over our room i went to phone the front desk and the phone in the front area was not working so i had to move the phone from the sleeping area and they sent a plungger up which didnt work  the security guard who brought the plunger did not seem apoligetic or sympathetic to the situation he seemed more concerned that we returned the plugger when we were done trying to fix their room finally they moved us to a different room so we moved all our stuff and sleeping children in the middle of the night to the new room which at least didnt smell of urine and sink backing up the rest of the stay was okay but i will never stay here again or reccommend it to anyone and i will definately will be telling my sister who is the travel agent who booked this trip not to reccommend this hotel to anyone else
bottom line if you are looking for somewhere you are comfortable taking you children dont bring them here the area the hotel was in seemed shady and the hotel seemed filled with young party crowd types there is too much stuff that needed repairs to mention
even after all this there are a couple good things if you can get over the run down condition of this hotel it is a great location if you are visiting seaworld and the san diego zoo and the beaches and there are a lot of stores and fast food places in the area if you are comfortable wondering there area",1.0

boston college trip,the staff at the holiday inn was very friendly and helpful nice holiday inn they are currently renovating their downstairs bar and eating area and have set up temporarily on the top floor well that was great we met a friend for a drink and had a treat to a wonderful view of the city the rooms are clean small typical city fare for rooms the location was perfect we were able to walk everywhere,3.0

excellent location and good value for money,the location was excellent and we really loved our room good quality linen fairly new bathroom and hardwood floors were the best it was also nice to see a little bit of sky from our window the staff was really friendly and they did their best to help us with all of our needs we would like to stay here again,4.0
great stay location and view,"we had a kingsize suite with a view of the empire state building on the 26th floor for three nights and it was superb
the reception was friendly and prompt the lifts are a little slow to catch as there are only two serving the hotel but this is new york and frankly not something worth thinking about 
the room was perfect sizeny is not known for big hotel rooms so hadnt expected much so wasnt disappointed 
location is really handy walking distance to penn station the highlinenorthmost section and time square
bed was very comfy we even ended up staying in one night watching tv and was wonderful
only down point is the wifi isnt free in the rooms but available in the reception area guess thats common though not just with this hotel
would stay here again for sure its worth going for the high level king suites with a view of the empire state building really adds to the experience was a bit pricey but think if you shop about you may get a better deal then we did we were woken up by drilling on one of the mornings at 8am but not sure if it was from a neighbouring building or not no pool and didnt try the gymspa so cant comment on that",5.0
great room lousy staff,"we stayed at the residence inn capitol from mar 2730 2008 this was the culmination of a road trip for me and my best friend from nashville to dc my fiancee also joined us in dc
before i get to the various negative experiences we had i want to point out a couple of positives the room was wonderful bed pullout bedcouch full kitchen free internet the free breakfast was delicious the store downstairs was convenient and offered a large selection of sundries and souvenirs and the person we spoke to at checkout kara a trainee was very helpful and friendly also the hotel has great security since you can only access the rooms by using your room key in the elevator
the location is decent for the priceabout a block or two from the subway station and 3040 mins walk to the mall there is a great seafood restaurant a block away the market inn it looks like nothing from the outside but it is really nice
however i cannot understand why people think this is such a great hotel we stayed in 5 hotels on this vacation 3 of them marriotts and this was the only one we really disliked
this is a very busy time in washington dc with spring break and the cherry blossom festival so i would expect every hotel to have adequate staff
when we checked in it was 2pm checkin is at 4pm but the hotel did hold our bags for us in a secure room with tags to keep track this was another decent point in our stay since the man who took care of this was helpful
there were two women at the front desk whom we encountered frequently in the mornings and even early evenings they were unfriendly and even rude at times the second day of our stay which was the first full day wed been in dc we spent the entire day out and returned to find that housekeeping never came we purposefully removed the do not disturb sign and even left a tip on the pillow when i called the front desk to tell them one of the women responded did you need something i told her we really just needed some clean towels and she said shed call housekeeping
after an hour and without towels we went to the pool area it was fairly crowded but there were no clean towels two women had already gone to the front desk quite a long time ago requesting towels and there still were none one of the women even told me she was having the same issue getting clean towels for her room as we were the rude woman at the front desk then came in with tiny little exerciseroom towels we told her we already knew those were there but that they were too small she said those were the only towels they had finally 20 mins later a man came in with barely enough fresh towels for the people in the pool area at that time
i then went to the front desk and personally requested clean towels i was rudely told that there is only one man who does housekeeping at night and then i was shown a list of room s he still has to visit the woman then said shed call him again with our request when he finally came by at 945pm right before we were going to go to sleep i asked him if he wanted to take the dirty towels but he said no that i should leave them for housekeeping i told him that housekeeping never came and he said it mustve been an oversight this is hotel of 13 floors and a lot of roomsone would think that they would have a better staff and that housekeeping wouldnt miss any rooms
our last morning we went down for the free breakfast around 9am later than usual and found no free tables many people were taking the food up to their rooms but we managed to find a table in the lobby itself fairly far from the buffet around 915 or so they opened an additional seating area breakfast closes at 10am 
when i approached one of those rude front desk clerks about checking out an hour late she told me checkout is 11am and we could store our bags downstairs i told her that every hotel including marriotts that wed stayed in had offered a late checkout although wed never used it on the trip i also told her the reason was that we wanted to see a bit more of dc before our flight in the afternoon and we didnt have time to checktag 10 bags at that point she relented and told me shed notate our account her attitude was unfriendly the entire time
if it wasnt for kara on our way out we wouldve left the residence inn with a completely sour taste in our mouths she was kind enough to get us a car to the airport and did everything with a smile 
maybe other people had a better experience because it was a quieter time of year i dont know our room had a view of construction and we were near the elevator with thin doors that left us hearing everyone in the hallway
i wouldnt stay here again although for the price i guess some people might be willing to put up with unfriendly staff",2.0
very nice highly recommend,stayed here with friends for a long weekend in august and loved the hotel enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour and the accomodations were quite nice our beds were very soft and comfortable we had excellent views of the river from our rooms the location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town with easy access to public transportation nearby my friends actually received the goldfish upon request which they enjoyed some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above but it was minimal price seemed very resonable to us for the location will certainly return to the windy city and plan on staying here again,5.0
great location clean friendly staff will definitely stay there again,location was perfect we walked everywhere we also took advantage of the free transit system at the 16th street mall which was on the next block we had the option to self park vs valet which saved us a few bucks more to spend at the awesome happy hours nearby would definitely recommend this property to friends and stay there again only downside  no pool this would have come in handy in 90 degree weather,5.0
awesome location with a good value,my husband and i stayed at the marriott gaslamp and had a great time it was in a perfect location next to san diegos petco park it was pretty cool we had drinks upstairs at their rooftop bar called altitude it looked right onto the field and watched part of the baseball game the rooms were super nice and the restaurant was pretty good too if you want a good nightlife season and good access to downtown san diego i would stay there theres no pool but our kids werent there so it was fine,5.0
central great barloungesky terrace,"hotel was not easy to find due to work on the facade reception is up the escalators the entrance lobby is very special but nice
situation is very central near columbus circle  central park out of the 2 rooms we had 1 was small the 2nd was ok but both were quite noisy
the sky terrace on 15th floor is really great with a nice view over the city lot of trees and flowers the bar downstair insideoutside is also nice note sky terrace  lounge downstair both close at 1000pm  staff is very friendly",3.0
from air force bunker to 5 star hotel,our stay at this hotel was excellent staff were courteous and quick with check in rooms were clean spacious and well stocked with toiletries the bed was a king bed with a down comforter the only think bad about the room was the remote control to the tv was slow to respond we had the buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant in the mornings which was delicious and our lunch and evening meals were catered by the hotel i would say the dining was good but mostly quality hotel style dining i believe the room rates were very moderate as compared to other hotels down town,5.0
amazing view decor and food,"i wish i could transplant this hotel to every city i visit i love love love it the room and furnishings were top notch the restaurant was amazing for dinner and the view from my room was breathtaking
staff friendly and curteous
its been a bit since i stayed here but i felt they were worth reviewing the w lakeshore is top notch",5.0
450 too expensive for a tiny 12 by 12 foot room,"room was tiny tv also small why do i need a bathroom half the size of the room
noisy air conditioning kept waking me up all night when checking out i told them about
the air conditioning noise turning on and off they said they would have adjusted the thermostat i know how to adjust a thermostat i asked housekeeper for a pack of toothpaste she never returned she left a dirty coffee cup in room during our dinner breakfast was nice",2.0

fan of the westin,i stayed at the westin tabor twice in one month both stays were marked by not only great rooms but also great service i arrived for my first stay around 930 pm i was exhausted from a long road trip the checkin clerk greeted me with a smile listened to my complaints about my road trip put me in a great room and sent a complimentary bottle of wine to my room the room i got for the second stay was nice but in a part of the hotel where i could hear street traffic they allowed me to change rooms twice the service i received at this hotel is the best i have ever encountered i will definitely stay there again,5.0
not home alone,"the great reputation and its superb location are great value as talking points many people ask is it still a hotel as its better part is now private residencesnevertheless it has charm and gracetry and get rooms facing central parkbut mostly they are privateyou are likley to face the 5th avenue or 58th streetthe lobby is chaotic with many people trying to get into the small rose bar and tea lounge and bouncers trying to unsuccessfully distinguish between guests and oustsiders
the service in the rooms is quite good and room service surprisingly prompt but do check if the cup came with the tea and the fork with the food before you dismiss the servergetting them back could take longthe ipad based services menu in the room is unique and mostly works but it can get you coffee but not tea as its not listedconnection errors are frequent too some rooms are circular under the cupola towers and are interesting in their space utilisation
the food at their signature restarunt is just passable with a very limited menuthe food market is great but its bills are not chargeable to the rooms
the butlers and stewards at the bar are quite full of attitude and will keep tables waiting empty for some special guests while inhouse guests wait aroundthey also have this smart alec and over familiar manner of speaking to guests which does not look like good service either
despite all this it was a good and memorable staywill i do it again nahit was for the experience and not the value for money",4.0
good place to stay in an area of highdollar hotels,"we spent four nights here over the christmas holiday and have no complaints we were visiting family in this area and found this to be a good place to spend the night our days we spent visiting the front desk was helpful and checkin was fastthey gave us a room on the back away from the highway as we had requested all the staff we met were friendly and helpful we were more than happy to comply with no service for christmas day in fact we had requested it before they left a notice in the roomeveryone needs time off for family then
clean rooms the bathroom is small but adequate the wifi was good breakfast was what wed consider minimal but there is a dennys in the parking lot how are you going to compete with that 
the property is the oldest of the la quinta chain weve stayed in and we would rate it only as average but this is no reflection on the staff or management sometimes you want more we didntthis was exactly what we needed a place to come and get a good nights sleep",3.0
couldnt have asked for more,"this hotel was fantastic from the moment we arrived to the moment we left sadly
from the maids to the valet front desk people the customer service  friendliness was awesome never have i been in a hotel where every staff member no matter who they were said hello or good morning and with a smile 
the location was excellent the happy hour was great perfect hotel for people with kids because of the breakfast and afternoon snacks
i would definately recommend this hotel and hope to be back thank you all",5.0
a mistake  but a good one,weve stayed at the super 8 in austin but it was the 183  airport and it was wonderful so this time we planned on staying there again but after moving furniture into our students apartment all day we were dead tired and couldnt remember the address of the right super 8 we ended up at this one and it worked out just fine it was exactly like the 183  airport beautifully appointed wellkept cleansmelling quiet and very comfortable i have to guess that both of these are run by members of the same family because the standards are equally high got the goodie bag upon checkin at midnight checked out the pillow menu and got a great very quiet and very clean room i plan on making several trips to austin again this year and im happy to know that either airport super 8 that i end up at will be just fantastic thanks again super 8s in austin,5.0
of all of the things i have an affinity for affinia 50 is on the top 5,"i am a business traveler so my opinion of hotels tends to be that of the most honest we live in hotel and we are thier mostregular customers we have high demands and we know what hotels accomodate our needs this hotel is one of them i frequent ny and i have stayed at this hotel 15 times in the last 12 months to give you an even better understanding of my loyalty i have stayed at affiniaowned properties at least 25 times in the last 15 months it has taken some time but i now walk through the door and am greeted by my name a nice perk i can honestly say that there are other hotels in othre locations that i have stayed at more friently that what i have professed at this hotel and still i recieve no recognition that is how this hotel differs
i can honestly say this hotel is more what you expect if you want a hotel that is provides you with the basics questionable cleanliness and no flares then this hotel is not for you however if you want individualized expedient service spacious immaculate rooms  moms youd feel comfortable bringing your baby here with littlefears of mrsa or ecoli hospitable staff yumalicious room service updated furniture a comfortable  safe setting ample outlets and the coziest bed you have ever slumbered in to the point where you even contemplate stuffing the whole bed in your luggage and running off with it then this is where you belong their level of hospitality surmounts every other hotel youve stayed in and is notthing you would ever expect the reason why thier motto is hospitality is because they are the best of the best if ever you wanted to live and be treated like royalty i would suggest you give this hotel a try they are receptive to couples older individuals families business travelers everyone 
being a business traveler i find this hotel to be very accommodating to my needs
1 outlets tons of them
2 office space there is an ergonomic chair and a generous size desk that allows me to work
3 living space good size amble seating clean and updated furniture there is even an outlet nearby where i can work and watch tv at the same time 
4 bed a million times better than the sealy posturepedic i have at home i never had rem sleep like that in my life it was the best
5 room service yuma licious especially the lentil soup at mint
there are truly no words to articulate the greatness that exists in staying at this hotel i have stayed at places from the hampton inn to the 5 star hotels during my stays in new york city and stillhands down id choose here over any of those so if you want to be treated like you deserve i implore you to share in my affinity for affinia",5.0
decent hotel business focus,"very convenient location in center city within the liberty place mall odd layout where you need to take 2 elevators to get to your room but rooms are well sized with king beds and work area 
amenities are nice lcd tvs etc though the bathroom clearly had some years on it  it was very clean but had a few old marks and age stains 
selfparking is 28day internet access has a surchage  all standard though free internet would have been a nice touch for a businessfocused hotel
front desk was polite though there was no bellhop to help with the luggage
would stay again at the hotwire price",4.0

want to return to seattle to stay at this hotel again,"we had an overnight layover in seattle recently and after my usual obsessive ta research booked rooms at cedar brook for our party of 9
being an airport hotel my husband was expecting to roll up at some crummy characterless building so he was blown away as we approached via a wooded driveway
it was in middecember so there were many christmas lights christmas trees and fireplaces in the lounges  for 2 families from australia this was a dream come true
our rooms were fantastic  the beds were the most comfortable of our 3 week trip the bathrooms also fantastic and the added attraction of free haagen daaz in the lounge was a bonus for the 5 kids when we arrived late in the evening
i appreciated the fitness centre greatly as had been sitting on a plane for most of the day
breakfast for us was rushed as we had to leave for our connecting flight but was more than adequate
we plan to return to seattle in 2 years for a proper visit to explore the city itself and think we will stay at the cedarbrook once again",5.0
very good hotel for the price,i dont understand some of the bad reviews i think the room i stayed in was excellent the room smelled nice the bathroom was very clean and so was everything else in the room the free breakfast is limited but delicious and always fully stocked you have a free meal every day while here the front desk staff really helped me out on sightseeing tours local places in the area and of course the price is right across the street the area around the hotel at night is a little sketchy but otheriwse this was really a great stay for the price and location cant wait to go back and stay here,4.0
not a pretty hotel but amazing staff,"i stayed for the last week of july and i actually liked it a lot the place is not so fancy but the staff helped me a lot during my trip since i didnt have a way to print anything or to look up directions on my not so expensive phone from mexico i kept bothering the young girl for directions on how to get places so the staff is very friendlythe wifi doesnt work that well in the rooms and thats a major no no but i would just go downstairs to the lobby and use it there the neighborhood is really nice i felt safe even after coming back at 3am which you cannot do in mexico the rooms are clean and house keeping was given daily when i stayed there the rooms are really small but then again thats new york overall a great stay i would definitely come back in the near future to book again here

a first quality stay,"stayed at the hyatt in november 2011 while attending a conference the hotel was conveniently local within walking distance of union station and capital hill still it felt quiet and residential the staff was great willing to go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable my only peeve was that there was a fee for internet use i have noticed this trend  the inexpensive hotels give free wifi while the more expensive ones charge 10 to 20 per day
this particular hotel is also within walking distance of the post office museum and a many other government points of interest it is recommended for families as well as those travelling alone or for business if one takes the train into union station a great place to spend some hours then you are within 10 minutes walking distance to the hotel even if you are a slow walker
other than the internet fee i cant think of anything negative to say about this hyatt",4.0
the best of many hotel stays,"our stay at the comfort suites was amazing one of the best nonresort hotels i have experienced our room was wonderful with a kitchen washer  dryer and a beautiful view of michigan ave the staff was everfriendly offering suggestions on where to eat and how to catch the tour bus also a great experience being a foodie i can enthusiastically praise the breakfast included in the price of the hotel
should i visit chicago again i would not hesitate to stay at comfort suites again ",5.0
great hotel and affordable for chicago,"great hotel prices are reasonable for downtown chicago and location is very central and close enough to walk to millennium park i got free breakfast and free drink vouchers with my package which was a plus with the breakfast you get a choice of hot orcold breakfast made to order 
they had an amazing power shower which was one of my favorite things rooms were very clean and spacious 
the staff were five star greeted us every time gave good recommendations on restaurants and very helpful overall",5.0
depressing odd decor makes the place less charming,for some reason the look and feel of the awesome lobby is not carried through to the rooms i love color but whats going in these rooms is just bizarre it looks like it was all done by an amateur interior decorator who thought heshe was being adventurousyellow and blue ceilings green wallpaper mixed with plaidgingham comforters peach wallsenough already i wanted to leave an hour after arriving sort of creepy and depressing,3.0
superior location to airport nice rooms,"we stayed two nights in this hotel just a short distance from chicagos ohare airport the hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport that runs about every 20 minutes you can take the cta blue line which is just a 5minute walk from the front door of the hotel or im sure you can call a cab too we didnt use a cab at all
the rooms of the hotel are nice if a bit modern the noise of the airport isnt bad though there is an airplane headed overhead from time to time that you can hear for being so close to one of the worlds busiest airports its surprisingly quiet our room had no bathtub in it which wasnt a big deal but if for some reason you like a tub this might be an issue for you check to see if they have one
while the hotel offers a unique dive in movie every friday and saturday night at their indoor pool where you can pull up a float or a lounge chair and watch a family movie by the pool in practice it doesnt work very well first you cant listen to it because well kids are loud and pool enclosures tend to echo second you cant see it very well because pools need a certain amount of lighting and the hotel didnt choose to use a very powerful projector so if you want to choose this place solely for this purpose it might not be the best choice
as you might surmise the hotel isnt really familyfriendly this isnt to say its a bad hotel as its not it appears to be quite new and everything is rather nice but it is nestled among several office buildings meaning there are really no choices for anything to do outside working hours and very few things to do even inside those hours the buildings themselves are alongside a rather large freeway a somewhat residential area is available across the freeway and there is a footpath across the freeway  but its a bit of a hike
because of that the lack of a tub and the design of the hotels eating facilities it is somewhat surprising that they even have a family night such as this one as the two dont really fit together but for us the hotel served the purpose well and we could easily catch the train into town when we needed to do so speaking of which the best deal we found was to get a visitor pass  5 for 24 hours of unlimited riding of trains and buses available at a number of locations including the airport",4.0
great overall experience ,"i cant say enough good things about the hotel allegro the front desk staff was very welcoming friendly and helpful and the doormen were very proactive in seeing if i needed directions to wherever i was going
the bed was probably the most comfortable ive ever slept in    certainly the most comfortable of any hotel bed everything looked clean and updated and it was very quiet i requested a room not facing street noise
the location is great if youre going to see shows such as shrek or billy elliot you can walk to many restaurants including restaurant row up on ontario street in about 10 or 15 minutes or if you want to take the l train theres a station a block away around the corner of the hotel at washington st  wells
there are 3 computers in a little room next to the front desk in case you need to check email it would be nice if they didnt charge extra for that my only constructive criticism there was also a wine tasting deal that they seem to have on a regular basis which seemed to be very popular",5.0

city vacation,get away to the city in july not a bad location breakfast was fantastic walked to major places of interest sears tower aquarium navy pier etc etc so we got our exercise always greeted when we walked in with a smile from the person at the desk and valet was quick with the car as well we requsted an upper floor room as others have to get away from the fire department sounds and our reqeust was met with no problems a king size bed suite with a sitting area and kitchen area all top notch if we find ourselves in the windy city again ill make sure to keep this hotel on the short list,4.0
perfect for weekend in chelsea,great location only 6 blocks from penn station and well situated for exploring chelsea and meat packing as well as kips bay across town very clean with very comfortable beds the poor service rating is due to having to call the front desk every time you need ice and at least one elevator being out of service the whole weekend the elevator card system was also quite annoying but overall still highly recommended  would stay there again,4.0
short and cozy getaway,first we arrived at 10am after flying all night  the front desk was checking out people from being totally full yet they were still able to get us in early so we could rest and clean up before our meeting the room was very clean  cozy with sleep number beds that alone was a little piece of heaven after an extremely long overnite flite,5.0

after your journey in the city relax in the outside and heated swimming pool

very good hotel great location for diving in the apple,"i regularly go this hotel on business trip for a long time i was boarding hotels in quieter areas 3d avlex  i was fearing the crowd of times square

the rooms are spacious quiet well decorated many were renovated lately 
staff is nice but but just  it is a very big hotel so quite impersonal and lots of traffic but it is the case of most new york hotels i would complain about the long and slow lines at reception  happens too often 
i do not use the hotel services much and could not comment on that so much available in the city why eat or drink or spend time in the hotel  well thats only my point of view 
higher floors offer great views to times square or the hudson",4.0
excellent stay in a very nice hotel,we spent a week in this hotel we were staying in a four people suite on the 19th floor 40 square meter with terrace for a very attractive price 350 usd per night a few words to describe the hotel modern and design very clean warm people extremely comfortable beds and furniture well located we will come back,5.0
stay elsewhere unless you must travel with your pet,"was sooooo disappointed this was our weekend getaway and the room was so small and depressing not the kind of room you want to just stay in an luxuriate you want to get out of it as much as possible 
for 230night in philly i expected more even after we got a free room upgrade to a higher floor we had no view and an average room at best there was room only for a desk chair no other the bathroom was small but clean
there was no warning that we were on a petfriendly floor and a barking little dog kept waking us up on the kimpton intouch questionaire they ask about your pillow preference but dont ask if you want a petfree floor they also ignored my newspaper preference and didnt give me one at all but thats minor
we left the 2nd night before our son went to sleep so we could drive home and sleep in our own beds between the dog barking and the banging noises going on at all hours in the hotel we couldnt sleep upon checkout the manager said hed email me to offer a return comp did you get the email i didnt 
weve stayed at other center city hotels and they all offer better value than this one the sofitel across tiny 17th street is better the rittenhouse is a bit pricier but nicer the warwick is nicer
they did a few cute things for kids but not worth the stay they bring up chocolate chip cookies and a goldfish in a bowl and a kids robe if you ask",2.0
fabulous hotel,"from meeting angel on the door as we arrived it was fantastic dominic all the bar staff and restaurant staff were real good company superb service from each and everyone of you and cant wait to get back top quality people across the hotel if you are the manager then please take note of these comments regards to you all a great experience

fantastic hotel,my 13 year old daughter and myself took our 1st trip to ny and decided to stay at the benjamin due to the reviews on trip advisor we had a fab time nothing was too much for the staff the room and facilities were 1st class a great location we walked everywhere the food excellent yes the food wasnt cheap but you got what you paid for excellent door man who was wonderfully helpful they really made a great fuss of us and i have no hesitation in recommending it weve already booked to go back,5.0
the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in,there were 2 adults and 2 young children in our party we had a room with 2 queen beds the room was quite small but clean and the beds were amazing truly amazing i need to email them and find out who makes their beds anyway the bathroom was a good size and service from the front desk was excellent this hotel says galleria area but its at least a 1015 minute drive away from the galleria next time i would stay closer to the galleria because you feel like youre in the middle of nowhere on katy freeway,4.0
great boutique hotel in west village,very comfortable small artdeco style hotel right on washington square room was smallish with no view but comfortable clean modern with all the amenities including terry robes continental breakfast included was nothing to rave about but was adequate and full breakfast was available staff was friendly and very helpful paid parking available a block away given the very reasonable rates this one is a nobrainer for anyone visiting nyc barebones fitness room,4.0
decent hotel conveniently located for access to entire city,i wanted to post a review because of all the mention of the bad location i stayed for 4 nights and always felt safe and secure while staying here the location is ideal for someone who wants to see more of sf than fishermans wharf theres easy access to all of the neighborhoods from here and the free hotel shuttle was great for getting to the touristy spots the room was big and had nice amenities i would absolutely stay here again,4.0
convenient stop helpful staff,the hotel was just off the expressway easy to get there the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable the staff was great i travel with a cat and the pet friendly room was one of the best on my trip the next morning as i tried to make an early start my cat hid i thought he was under the king size bed i called the staff for help lifting the mattress and the kind gentleman was quick and very nice he was surprised that the cat could get in the small space at the head of the bed not under it he helped me put things back and did not want a tip for this special service the breakfast was first rate the dining room cleanthe only negative was that the neighborhood is not as nice as it was three years ago when i last visited i still felt very safe for myself and my car at this hotel,4.0
a cool experience with a colder female receptionist,"spent 4 nights in the thompson les had been watching their website for a couple of months prior to our trip and noticed fluctuations in pricing initially the superior queen room was 379 per night i contacted the hotel directly and they offered me a rate of 300 per night  which i declined just before christmas their rate dropped to 179 per night  so we opted for an upgrade to studio king suite for 239 per night  good value considering the basic room was 379 the previous week
checkin was a sullen cold experience with a female receptionist who didnt speak or engage with us  apart from asking us to hand over credit card details never gave any eye contact and her diva like persona was the coldest experience i have ever had checking in anywhere in the world she handed over our keycard without a word of what floor we were situated on directions to our room or any basic information one might expect on check in think this lady would prefer to be the other side of the counter or perhaps on a catwalk not a good career choice as a receptionist methinks who hires these people
the delightful doorman escorted us and our baggage to our room  talked us through the basics and more than made up for the divalike experience we had with his sullen colleague all other staff we encountered were polite courteous and efficient
the room wow initially didnt know what to make of the room the bare concrete dark wood mirrored glass walls were stark  however the luxurious elements overrode my initial concerns within minutes i loved this room and it proved to be one of the most relaxing comfortable rooms i have stayed in our room overlooked the pool and orchard street no city view but it proved to be a great location insofar as we had no noise pollution during the night
the hotel is situated in the lower east side  a wonderful vibrant area with a plethora of good restaurants bars etc 
to be honest this hotel may not suit a lot of people it is portraying itself as a cool trendy place it is and wouldnt be a place i would recommend to my parents actually as a 40something year old i felt a little aged at times neither would i recommend it for families dont know if they supply cribs etc and didnt see any information regarding same
one point deducted due to our experience with la diva on reception apart from that we had a fab time in a fab hotel in a wonderful location would definately stay here again provided i got a good rate and would definately recommend to anyone looking for a modern edgy hip different experience just keep an eye on their rates to bag a good deal",4.0
its a nice place has a few quirks,"basically its a really clean hotel the room was very modern and clean the room is a little small but for one person it was fine i always check for pests when i arrive in a hotel and did not find any bedbugs really big plus i read some of the other comments and quite frankly i cannot see that being an issue at this hotel it is kept up well i did hear the water running in the other room but it did not keep me awake true its a little old but they look like they are at least trying very hard in spite of the challenges 
i did however think that the parking charge was outrageous 3500night to park thats highway robbery i cant stand it when hotels charge for parking that should be included in the price i will probably never stay downtown again for that reason
other than the parking i was impressed for the most part",4.0
very good fantastic location,"we stayed here for 5 nights in november as a stopover from flying home from visting relatives from houston 
having stayed in ny several times in the last few years this was the first time in the sofitel and was booked purely on the strength of reviews from trip advisorpreviously we had stayed at the plaza as a 30th birthday pressie to my wife in a great room sad to see its being turned into apartments and before that i had stayed at other hotels around central park area this was the first time we had stayed more centrally and to be fair i had some concerns that noise would be an issue however this was not the case
the room was good without being great but being a light sleeper this was more than made up for by the fact it was quiet and in a busy hustling city like ny this is a blessing 
the location could not be better basically two blocks to times square and almost everything in close reach having stayed near central park previously the one criticism of that area is that it is a fair old walk down to the theatre district and macys etc etc
from the sofitel its fantastic everything is within walking distance altho i would still recommend the bus tour 2 day pass as a means to getting around new york cheaply and you learn things on the way round also
the hotel foyer and lobby is beautiful and spotlessly clean the service is great and mostly the concierge is very helpful the guys at the door are even more helpful and a good means of information 
a couple of helpful hints
use the hotels town car service for pick up and drop offs at the airport its only marginally dearer than a standard cab and an aawful lot more comfortable when you add toll fees etc to a standard cab its practically the same the hotel arrange this without hassle the guys at the door can also aid you with this on the way back
avoid the hotel barits pretentious beyond belief and the service here unlike the rest of the hotel was very very poor they were more interested in preening themselves and looking cool for the business people populating the bar than actually serving anyone besides ny is full of good bars and restaurants by the way the indian restaurant 200yds to the left down the street of the sofitel is very very good
overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great starting base in ny its clean comfortable and stylish even better if you get a deal i cant think of better value in ny as its location is perfect well be back herewell just avoid the bar",4.0
fantastic views,"my wife and i were absolutley wowed by the stunning central park views from our 23rd floor room  and by night the skyline was even more impressive 
we were generaly impressed by the hotel overall and were puzzled by less than complementary reviews we had read prior to our stay
the room service was good  as was the food the staff were friendly and efficient and the room was clean and well presented
however a tip i would pass on to anyone considering staying here would be to get down for breakfast early or you will have a long wait",4.0
great hotel nice staff,overall very good experience breakfast was great fruits cereals assorted pastries coffee juice yogurt etc the room was also great very clean  even though i found a cigarrette bud staff is incredible and always willing totally recommend to anyone going to manhattan location in midtown is great near clubs and restaurants and 5th ave,5.0
great stay,well first time in ny  the hotel was great good rooms good facility  good location building going on next door is noisy during the day but we were always out  about we would stay again,4.0
comfy clean and awesome castro location and cheap,this is not a fancy gay bb or resort  it is a motor lodge the bed was comfortable the room clean the best part is the pricevery cheap for the castro area just a short walk to the gay golds gym the castro shops and dinning choices right on the f line the cable car that will take you to fishermans wharf perfect location,4.0
not bad for the price and location,nice rooms clean free breakfast perfect location right next to water st and in between harborplace and power plant live valet parking was very convenient come and go as you please for 24 hours for only 30 bucks other garages make you pay every time you leave great staycation,4.0
great dallas hotel,this was an awesome hotel the lobby is beautiful and very welcoming the front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating my room was not ready upon check but was given a complimentary upgradethank you kristen the staff in the lounge were greaterin was very welcoming and warm the restaurant asador was above my expectations of a typical hotel restaurant the food was very good i was impressed that all the food comes from local farmers and that the menu is seasonali loved this concept the service was superb they also offer a tequila menu with over 100 different kinds i would definitely recommend this hotel,5.0
exceeded expectations in every way,"for the price given this is in the middle of downtown and therefore quite convenient i expected much less from this room and hotel the room we were given had a fantastic view was very clean and incredibly spacious the bathroom was so spacious i think it is a waste of space but no complaints the staff was as friendly as what you would find at a fine resort from the desk staff to the hospitality staff to the valets
i highly recommend this hotel",4.0
great location,my wife and i stayed in the hotel during a business trip the hotel was in easy walking distance to all of the shows we attended and plenty of great restaurants from which to choose we found the room and bed comfortable with a great view of times square the room was clean and reasonably well equipped i only have two minor comments that could have improved our stay the first is the internet connection while i did not use the room internet for which the hotel charged 16 a day there was a free wireless connection available not provided by the hotel why some hotels dont offer this for free while others do is just a silly nickel and dime dig the other is plumbing noise from adjacent rooms although not too distracting if you are a light sleeper you might be awakened if your neighbor has an early shower or visits the toilet during the evening with that said we will certainly stay there again,4.0
whats not to like,"the bowery is a great example of what a boutique property should and could be ive been staying in new york for decades but im always in search of the next satisfying hotel experience this was only a one night stay so i picked the bowery for its location near my meeting and for the excellent reviews here and on tablet now i wish there had been more time for a longer stay 
reception and check in were relaxed and helpful the lobby bar is warm and inviting and the staff was gracious and accommodating its like staying in a private club but without the aloofness my room was a decent for nyc size with special interesting touches and super comfortable bed 
room service breakfast is excellent prompt and reasonable for nyc and the lobby bar is a clubby warm and engaging scene the location is an easy walk to all the great nearby soho treats just north of houston so the bowery can be a perfect hotel from which to enjoy the city in short whats not to like",5.0
at that price you pay for wifi,i got stranded at airport and united paid for my stay but the review is limited on a short 6 hour stay room was good location for airport terminals i was in were great but i was surprised on the cost of additional services heh super 8 motels and mcdonalds gives me free wifi but the hilton has fee i was impressed in my room was small package with a cheap razor a comb and a toothbrush ïn case i forgot something unlike holiday inn which gives these for free the hilton wanted 7 heh not a big deal but at the rates they charge why is there a chage at all where is the value id stay on less impressive sheets a smaller tv and a checkout guy not wearing a fancy suit and get a lower rate with free wifi elsewhere if i was paying i have to say as i entered the terminal at 430 am a very short walk from hotel im sure i felt betterthan the people i saw sleeping on the chairs in the terminal ah a shower,3.0
uberhip nice location but beware,"stayed at the standard for four nights over food and wine festival the location is superb if you like the west village part of nyc 
the hotel is hip and the decor is really nice the staff was very helpful at the front desk and on the street to hail cabs ran into at least 5 celebrities whilst in the elevator 
even on a high floor you will hear music at all times of the night usually until 4am even coming home at 3am i could hear booming on a sunday night 
overall a nice hotel to stay in however a high price to pay 500 dollars night  if you arent a party animal i dont recommend staying here",3.0
style over substance,it is obvious that a lot of money has been put into this hotel the rooms and common areas are very stylish but they clearly put style above functionality it took me ten minutes to find the tiny switch on the euro desk lamp the retro radioalarm clock was attractive but you literally could not read the display the lighting is terrible in both the rooms and many common areas the stalls in the mens room were barely lit  with very dim red ceiling lights the rooms themselves werent much better even with every light on in the room it was hard to read a book the door to the bathroom was a slider that you could not close all the way let alone lock but you had no privacy in any event because the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom is actually the frosted glass wall of the shower if youre showering with the bathroom light on you would be pretty much exposed to anyone in the room the shower has a glass door which again looks nice but it leaked so badly that the floor was literally covered with water after every shower i paid over a thousand dollars for three nights and would have been much more comfortable in a homewood suites the location is excellent and it is a beautiful renovation of this older hotel but its clear that interior design took precedence over everything else the result is an expensive attractive and uncomfortable hotel,2.0
a grand hotel,"i have stayed at the palace hotel at least 8 times both for business and for pleasure the hotel is simply grand and a step back to a classic era just walking thorough the hotel and admiring a the architecture is a treat the garden court especially in the afternoon is just beautiful
check in always quick and friendly have never experienced anything less during any check in
location on the corner of new montgomery and market you can get around the city on foot very easilybut wear a good pair of walking shoes there is a bart station located right in front of the hotel and the f train also runs along market street this hotel is located in the financial district on the weekends and during the evening this area is very quiet and most businesses around it are closed be sure to try the sentinel across the street in the morning for fresh muffins amazing
room rooms are very nice with high ceilings comfortable beds flat screen tv mini bar desk and additional chair for relaxing i have also sometimes had a room with a sitting area that included a couch and walk in closet rooms have always been very clean during my stays decor is also very tasteful and relaxing shades of blue and neutral warm beiges
bath this would be the only slightly negative item in my opinion the bath rooms are small with very limited counter space and i do not care to store my items on the toilet tank the hotel has done its best to provide counter space with marble counters surrounding the sink tubshower combination there may be larger baths available in the hotel but i have never had a room with a large bath amenities are generously sized and are by gilchrist and soames
room location rooms that back up to the alley at the west end of the hotel can be noisy during the early hours i heard trucks all night long rooms facing market street have street noise and cable car noise until about 11pm which really didnt bother me there are also interior rooms that are extremely quiet but you will want to be sure the sheers are drawn or you will look into another room directly across the open space
overall i would recommend the palace as a very pleasurable hotel",5.0
simply brilliant and outstanding,we stayed at an avenue apartment suite for several nights the enormously spacious living space the brave simplicity and yet utterly elegant design were simply stunning as were the professional and friendliness of all the staff the bar on 5th really astounded us in the most pleasant way when alexis ordered a classic drink moscow mule ginger beer fresh lime vodka an esoteric drink that was last seen at the plaza hotel 1970s as her parents told us the bartender not only served it in its traditional russian copper mug but made their own ginger beer it was truly impressive and of course the culinary inventiveness at the ai fiori borders on miraculous will definitely return as setai ranks right up there among our favorite hotels in nyc the peninsula the towers at the palace as well as the mandarin oriental,5.0
would not recommend it,"i stayed at the grand hyatt for 2 nights at the beginning of june i chose the hotel since it was the venue for a rating agency conference that i was attending its always nice to stay in the same hotel as the conference as it cuts out the travel time and one can always nip to the room during boring presentations 
but i made the wrong decision this is one tired hotel the rooms are musty and dirty the bathrooms are ok but have sub standard towels it just felt smelt and looked old its not worth the money you pay i paid 319 per night a corporate rate there was litter in the hallways of the hotel that no one seemed to pick up and was there for both nights i was there and worse still the service was terrible it took an hour for the room service to be delivered and that was bad too i also lost my keys in the hotel room and e mailed the lost and found address on the bill to ask if they had been found you guessed it no reply from the lost and found address i would stay away from this hotel if you are travelling on business pay slightly more and stay at the ny palace its well worth it the grand hyatt is definitely not grand and not worthy of the hyatt brand",2.0
very nice and clean,this hotel was one of the cleanest hotels i ever stayed at the decorum was very modern the hallways were curved it was different then the straight up down hallways of ever other hotel i was ever at the staff was great bonus the young ladies working look like they chose to work at a hotel rather then be models they where all very beautiful we are spg members and were upgraded to the top floor we asked for more billows and a refrigerator and they brought them up in minutes the staff was great could not have asked for anything more from them the room was nice and clean has a over priced stock refrigerator and snacks separate from the one they brought up at no charge the inside from floor 5 and up is stone the only down side is no amenities besides a average size fitness center no pool no sauna parking is 38 a night and takes a little while to get your car i would recommend this hotel as long as you do not care about the amenities when you first walk in there is a bar and that got a little crowed and loud not sure why they put in there did not care for that they do have a restaurant and like all downtown philly restaurants a bit pricey,5.0
very special place in san francisco to remember,"we had our wedding and the reception at the hotel vitale on the rooftop veranda with gorgeous bay and city view we also spent four nights at this upscale boutique hotel located downtown san francisco
service was exceptional and my husband and i were treated with special care as newlyweds our room had breathtaking bay view and we took lots of pictures of unforgettable sweet memories
food was exceptional with upscale presentation 
would recommend this hotel to travelers and guests who appreciate unique upscale boutique style and downtown location would love to celebrate our one year anniversary at vitale next year its our special place ",5.0
more like a good holiday inn but highly recommend,"first of all if you are planning to go to the staples center for any events i highly recommend staying in downtown the location is great and there is a fare few restaurants and bars to eat drink and dance only 6 cab to staples or 5 minute walk
the sheraton was a good choice at 190 pn plus taxes in a really good area 
i probably wouldnt pay any more for the reasons mentioned by other reviewers  no pool no gym no safe and house keeping is a tad lazy didnt put iron ironing board and hair dryer away there is no free wifi in rooms only in the lobby
however the rooms are very spacious and the bed is extremely comfortable
i would compare this stay to a very good holiday inn i once stayed in and i highly recommend it",4.0
spectacular views and great service,we enjoyed the stunning view from a hudson river suite and i highly recommend this investment  its every cent worth but not only the view was outstanding but also the service in the hotel we ended up with a complementary bottle of wine and a cheese plate for little mistake that was not even worth to mention wow what a nice surprice in the evening,5.0
i have nothing good to say,"consider yourself very very lucky if you have had anything other than the worst hotel experience of your life here we were there for a week and had 3 rooms in this hotel
the first room was filthy with no air conditioningheating but were not fussy people and knew we werent paying for a 5 star hotel so we gave it a go it would have been ok except that when we got back from a day of sightseeing our room and all the rooms around us were unlocked with doors wide open there were 2 men who looked like they were maintenance people who told us we had to leave our door open so that they could run cables through to the other rooms when we confronted the hotel manager who has a limited grasp of the english language she denied it and said no one had access to the rooms in the hotel we took her up to the room and instead of apologising for the fact that anyone could have walked into our room and taken all our things she just said ok i give you other room
the new room looked a lot better and we were quite happythen we woke up the next day and i looked like i had a disease i had been bitten all over my body more times than i could care to count by either bed bugs or fleas we gave it another night and it only got worse when we went to complain we had to join a queue of people in similar condiotions or people complaining about cockroaches in their bathroom again all she said was you want another room uh yes i think we did
so we ended up in the room next door to the first one we had and this one at least had heating but boy was the radiator noisy if it didnt sound like water running it wistled like a boiling kettle i was doped up on anithistamines but my husband got no sleep at all 
we got no apologies or explanations for anything and i must say that the hotel manager seemed all to used to these type of complaints given the opportunity i would not stay in this hotel again even if it was free
i honestly hope that this has put you off staying here because nothing is worth the experience we had there i only wish i had read the reviews before booking this hotel",1.0

wonderful hotel in the gas lamp district,i must agree with a few other reviewers it is not five stars the lobby is full of character and charm of a bygone era the rooms are small yet well furnished and with a very nice bathroom if you have a room with a joining door expect to hear every utterance the party next door makes i mean every utterance  the staff was wonderful you can not find a more friendly helpful staff the valet though convenient was very expensive i felt safe walking at night from the hotel into the gas lamp district i would stay here again for the right price not 18500 a night,4.0
upscale hotel in downtown phoenix,we stayed at the westin for 5 nights surrounding our sons wedding the rooms are very large clean and intelligently arranged we particularly liked having a refrigerator in our room the location is convenient to all downtown venues and is across the street from the light rail for access to phoenix cultural sites on central ave wifi is available in the lobby but there is an additional charge for room access the fitness center has a great view as you work out and has uptodate equipment my only negative comment is that the valet parking  28day is too expensive especially when you also wind up tipping the valets every time they retrieve your car for the budgetminded the holiday inn express a few blocks away is not as opulent but is clean and convenient and does have free parking and breakfast fyi there is a convenience store in an asu building 1 block north of the westin on central,5.0
family gettogether,we had a family gettogether and all had a great time we were there from thursday thru monday and enjoyed a great buffetstyle breakfast each morning that was included in the room price they could use 1 or 2 more items to the buffet and it would make it fantastic the front desk staff and breakfast assistants were wonderful parking was plentiful and a very nice pool as well very centrally located and just minutes to the highway we would definately stay ther again,4.0
perfect for families  great location large rooms free breakfast,we paid 8900 a night for a king deluxe suite with a bedroom separated by french doors the den was large with a full size sofa bed the kitchen included a full size fridge a stovetop microwave and a dishwasher also a washer and dryer are onsite our first floor room had a 12 bay window in the bedroom and a huge window in the den that both overlooked the beautiful landscaping outside all areas were clean and nicely decorated i35 and other main highways are 1 minute away and downtown is very easliy accessible in 510 minutes the free breakfast was hearty and weeknights include a free dinner our family of 5 was perfectly comfortable,5.0

rustic charm better suited to a rural inn rather than a business hotel,was looking for a corporate hotel in the galleria area and defaulted to the granduca out of curiosity after our cheap corporate travel department took the st regis off our approved hotel list this is not a hotel for business travelers perhaps this place would come across as a luxury retreat if it were plopped down in rural texas disneystyle as a fauxeuropean country inn targeted to people who couldnt find italy on a map but for the global business traveler faced with the torture of having to travel to houston this place only accentuates the unpleasantness of it all the staff at the front desk tried hard but were defeated by computers that kept freezing the room was highly dated and smelled marginally musty lighting in the bathroom was awful and the tub was made of fiberglass think cheap american subdivisions coffee delivered as part of room service was lukewarm wont stay here again,2.0
right in the middle,nice hotel with good concierge service and great beds good view from the 16th floor however no balconythings to do the duck tour was pretty good shaws grocery store near by best place to eat the cheesecake factorylarge portionsbig enough to split with someone and not too pricey most things are within walking distance we even walked back from a redsox gamebe sure to go to  cheers  i would not recommend renting a car  traffic heavy and parking at the hotel is very high like 40 a day,4.0
very nice staff ok room great locationclean,"just got home from a week in philadelphia stayed at the hilton garden inn right next to reading terminal market the market was great for getting fresh foodsalad sandwiches almost anything you would need there is also a wawa quick market and a cvs pharmacy nearby that is okay the kmart in the mall near the hotel is awful so dont even bother with that place the hotel is clean and they have a breakfast buffet every morning that is really nice but its kind of expensive they do have a free coffee on the 10th floor every morning and free cookies after 5pm that are freshly baked the repair man and almost all the staff that i seen is always busy trying to make the hotel the best it can be the ladies at the front desk are very informative and one particular clerk johnaka ware even personally walked me to the metro to help me find exactly which train to take back to the airport the next day she really went out of her way to help me and we were able to find our train really quick the next day we left our room at 805 and we were on our way to the airport by 825 zipped right on down there and was at the airport by a little before 9am cost was 625 each one way i think if you buy your tickets from the window but a dollar more if you buy them on the train we walked to many attractions like independence hallbetsy ross house philadelphia mintfederal reserveelfreths alleyold city taverncity hall tower what a great view eastern state penn museum row the first post office which has a really nice courtyard behind it with part of ben franklins old home even a museum coming soonunder construction right now also christ church and the grave sight where benjamin franklin is buried we also went to the aquarium and took the ferry across the delaware river which was very short but relaxing go to the comcast building to see a neat screen also china town is interesting they have a fortune cookie bakery so i bought some chocolate fortune cookies
 my only complaint is that the exercise room is small and the equipment is nice but well used so they need to keep an eye on upkeep of the machines just little annoying things like the head phone jack is missing on the bike and one of the treadmills broke down during my last few days and there are tvs on each machine but some dont get all the channels but that is a great feature anyway all in all i enjoyed my time at the hilton garden inn and i would recommend it we took day trips to atlantic city on greyhound and new york on bolt bus both were very inexpensive and had a good time",4.0
beautiful hotel but the concierge was very unhelpful and rude,we stayed at the w hotel in san diego for two nights and had a wonderful trip the hotel itself was beautiful clean and the rooms were spacious the concierge however was extremely unhelpful in providing restaurant recommendations and directions we had three separate experiences where we asked for help and each time we were treated coldly without proper direction when asking for restaurant recommendations we were provided with a few chain recommendations which was not exactly what we were looking for while on vacation i also had to ask in a variety of ways how to get from place to place and again was offered minimal to no help each person was also extremely unfriendly and actually rude if you do stay at the w you should not rely on any recommendations or help from the concierge,3.0

loved the film history and ambiance,stayed here for 5 nights back in april got a great deal for 3 people room was huge 2 lovely comfy beds free internet in the lobby v ery handy found front desk staff on a whole very helpful 1 or 2 grumpy but get that everywhere i think gave me literature on all the filmshows that had been filmed at the hotel and i got great kick out of going through the list of them one of the large function rooms was preparing for a fancy wedding and i peeked in staff in there very welcoming insisted i come in and take pictures which i thought was real nice the swimming pool was small to what i am used to but still clean and acceptable very close to metro station and a good shopping centre practically around the corner abolutely loved the hotel lobby and any shows i see on the tv now im checking to see if filmed here,4.0
historic hotel with small rooms and understated bathrooms,"i booked two rooms at the westin for me and my girlfriend and my parents the lobby is amazing and the building has a ton of character very cool public spaces but it is an old hotel and as a result the rooms are small my parents managed to cash in on the upgrade to an oversize room which was very nice my room was small and nothing to write home about if you are looking for a historic building with a ton of charm i say stay here the parking lot doesnt seem that secure for 40 a night and you can probably park in the more secure transit lot across the street for less i think columbus probably has a lot more luxurious rooms 
hotel is totally fine for what is doing but one could appreciate its historic character without staying in the rooms",3.0

 the room was nicely appointed standard marriott the view of the harbor from the terrace was great 
 bed was the new marriott type and was very comfortable
 the pool while small for a resort was great
the only issue that folks should be aware of is that the concierge has some deal worked out with some restaurants in the gas lamp district we were sent to the same set of restaurants at least twice the restaurants were good not exceptional and we felt like they were not giving their best advice",4.0
best rate great breakfast good room,dont let the address fool you the hotel is on tyvola road at nations ford our gps did not recognize the street address which is actually a named driveway we got our room for less than 60 and it was a nice big room not a suite with a mini frige and microwave the breakfast was great with scrambled eggs sausage bacon waffle station and a good variety of standard fair like cereals and breads and juices even though the hotel was full the breakfast area was kept clean and fully stocked the only disappointment was the hot tub was out of service we didnt check out the small indoor pool or the small exercise room but they were there the business center had two computers and printers,5.0
great hotel and neighborhood,"i stayed 3 nights at the cooper square now the standard and this place met all expectations and more first the pros
1 awesome unobstructed views of downtown skyline and brooklyn booked a cooper 1 room but called beforehand if it was possible to be upgraded to a higher floor and voila we were placed on a room on the 18th floor with an amazing view 
2 the location surprisingly good i wasnt expecting much from the neighborhood but after briefly walking around i realized it was the perfect location 10 min distance to both soho and greenwich village dozens of trendy bars and restaurants peels bianca saxonparole
2 the hotel bar was a plus a perfect place to begin and end the night with a perfectly mixed cocktail eclectic selection of beers and really friendly staff
3 huge bed and high quality linens and pillows
4 really good minibar especially with alcohol selection 
5 although i had minimal contact with staff they were always friendly and responsive checkinout were lightening fast 
now the cons 
1 poorly lit hallways and elevators i really would like to understand the person who designed the elevators with its dark and gloomy feel red lights no mirror or musicit simply felt like a dungeon who would like to start the day like that
2 due to big minibar there wasnt much room left for a wardrobe and its 3 hangers do you expect a couple to need only 3 hangers
overall the experience has been overwhelmingly positive the cons being only minor inconveniences i would highly recommend this hotel and im already looking forward to go back",4.0
great location,"my husband and i just returned from a four night stay at this hotel so glad that i chose it for the balcony but especially the location it is less than a five minute walk to metro and about 10 to georgetown
front desk staff were young but very friendly and pretty effecient we arrived early and were able to check right in our room room was very nice a queen bed sofa and chair tv table for two and chairs refrig microwavecoffee maker coffee grinder the worksbathroom was also very clean and not small as mentioned in other reviews
washington post at your door every morning too
hotel was a little noisy on the first night but we were so exhausted we didnt hear much
tried the restaurant downstairs for breakfast but did not have a good experience waiter and cold food too many other restaurants in georgetown to choose from so dont waste your time here 
would definitely stay here again but maybe on the pool side of the hotel as it may be a little less noisy and more private",4.0
great value of money and excellent location,we booked this hotel via a website and got an incredibly good deal hotel is not up to sheraton standard but i think service room and the location are quite goodnot mentioning the value of money the only thing is hotel can be noisy so avoid the room facing the bus station and low floor it can be really noisy if you stay on the low floor and the wall is pretty thin so you can hear your nextdoor very clearly hotel provides free wireless connection at the lobby so bring your labtop otherwise you end up paying so much for a very very slow internet access at the business centeroverall i do like the hotel and the enjoyed staying at this hotel,4.0
very good for our first experience,"i was in doubletree times square for a vacation with my son we loved the location that was really amazing 
the room was very big with all comforts but it needed some renovation 
i would definitely recommend to a friend of mine",4.0
totally recommended,"we got a room for a great price through priceline beforehand i was a bit worried as other reviews were complaining about tiny rooms when booked through priceline so i emailed the hotel and requested a room with two beds and we got a nice spacious top 14th floor room with a view 
the staff was friendly also very kidfriendly and though im into modern furnishing and design i really enjoyed the historic atmosphere of this hotel
locationwise this hotel was perfect for exploring boston everything was in walking distance and if youre not into walking there are two subway stations nearby",5.0
good hotel great staff,"stunning location with the best view in boston the outside terrace is a great place to eat on a pleasant afternoon but we found the portions rather small for the price and filled up on bread although we got a good deal on the room price the views from our large room made a perfect end to our new england road trip and we hauled the sofa around and drank our last beers as we watched variety of working and pleasure craft crisscross the bustling harbour englishmans spelling and an airship circling in the distance over fenway park you can see it on my uploaded photo a magical relaxed evening no need for tv computers or books just bask in the view
when we dropped the rental car off we walked back along the seafront promenade from the rental facility to the hotel which was a beautiful short stroll
the staff were all excellent including a manager who went out of his way to enquire if guests were enjoying their stay but the concierge team were by far the best i have seen in any hotel
if i was being really picky i could point out the cracked tiles in the lift and the weeds along the waterfront not the hotels job i realize but id get my gardeners to tidy up in front of the hotel if the city wont and my only real criticism of the hotel you have to pay for wifi access even at the cheapest motels wifi was free and i resented being asked to pay so i didnt luckily we had those amazing views across one of the prettiest harbours in the world to take our minds off it 
the water taxis across to various points were brilliant and fequent even if youre on a budget do it at least once then use the hotel courtsey bus to the t bostons subway for other trips across the bay but check with the concierge team on cheapest way
on balance risk the weeds cracked tiles and lack of free wifi and stay here if you visit boston",5.0
hear and feel the flavor of venice,"i brought my 16 yr old daughter and my 15 yr old nephew for their first visit to venice we arrived around noon and had no problem getting a parking space yes it is quite a tight area but very doable knowing that check in wasnt until 300 we went in to let them know that we were parked in their spots the front desk was very nice and told us that our ocean view room would be ready in about 45 minutes he suggested a place for us to eat and then return to check in 
it was a perfect day so we walked the boardwalk enjoying the street vendors and by my surprise a few sidewalk shows that were pro a clean life of no drugs or alcohol a nice message for the teenage travelers i had with me by the time we returned it was 330 
our room was ready and totally added to our trip we had a window that directly overlooked the boardwalk beach and could see the santa monica pier we watched and listened with amusement the people of venice it was great before we knew it it was 6pm the kids wanted a snack and there is a little market across from the hotel where i could watch from our room their trip there and back
we walked to the pier about a 25 minute walk before the sun went down we experienced the pier ate dinner and took a taxi back for about seven dollars
they have an all day coffee and hot cocoa machine muffins in the morning and a friendly staff if you are really picky and do not enjoy life to the fullest this place is not for you this hotel is clean yes historic but clean in the perfect location and a great price enjoy the stay with getting an ocean view room where you can see the ocean even while in bed",4.0
rat hole,i traveled 400 miles to give my daughter and son n law their first baby shower a very special event for us all upon arriving at this poor excuse for a hotel with a set time to meet the banquet coordinatorunload items for the shower and decorate i was told the banquet coordinator was not available and could not be reached by phone i was also informed that we could not have access to the rooms until later in the day we drove back to my daughters which was an hr drive when we came back that afternoon to get ready for over 100 guest we were told by the manager that the elevator would not work without her key but she would make herself available at all times to escort our guest to the 4th floor most of our guest had to climb 4 flights of stairs just to enter a room that was so hot that the 3 tier cake melted and the top layer fell off the temps outside were well over 100 degrees and the humidity was unbearable the room was just as hot my daughter which is 8 months pregnant nearly fainted from the heat when i complained about the heat in the room i was told to keep the door closed leading into the hall way because there is no air conditioning in the hall kind of hard to keep the door closed when you have a 100 guest arriving do yourself a favor dont waist your money on this place this place should be condemned it is filthy and not fit for animals to stay in,1.0
diane cheek was very prompt and helpful,checkin began with anza who was very prompt and helpful then in the morning we had requested water and diane cheek was incredibly prompt and had water delivered within a few minutes this is the perfect hotel stay for all of your lax travels,5.0
prefer other dc hotels but not bad,stayed at this huge hotel for a conference and was assigned a room in the older part of the hotel far from everything elseand when i say old i mean colonialera creaky wood floors peeling paint wornout beds nevertheless it wasnt the worst place i have stayed i cant comment on the other sections of the hotel but the hotel common areas and amenities were very nice the location was excellent with a metro station a few steps away and great restaurants nearby the national zoo a few blocks away made for a pleasant visit too ultimately unless i attend another conference here i would prefer to stay elsewhere instead,3.0
great nyc hotel if you want an authentic city experience,"rooms are very generous in size bedding very confortable as with most nyc hotels street noise can be a bit much so ask for a room as high up as possible and facing broadway yes broadway is actually quieter than 77th street where there is a firehouse
the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful easy to get cabs and the 1 red line is a block away and you can be in the theatre district in no time at all central park and the museum of natural history are an easy walk if you want a hotel in a quiet new yorky neighborhood away from the touristy excess of times square look no further then ota",5.0
great hotel fantastic service and large rooms,"the sofitel is a great hotel which is close to time square but not in all the hustle and bustle 
the service from walking in to the checkin area is very smooth the front desk lady which assisted me was vivian she was great the room service and house keeping were also great i consider myself high maintenance and called them about four times in the span of three hours and they came up immediately
the room was large for new york standards the room is roughly 360 sq ft the bathrooms are all marble and done with great taste the amenities in the bathroom are great there are qtips nail filer and many other things which women would use 
the room has three phones and a 32 inch flat screen tv which is very nice 
i would not recommend eating at the sofitel the prices are outrageous even for new york i mean 25 for cup of fruit thats a bit crazy for brunch i would recommend going to cookshop 44x hells kitchen pastis cafe orlin etc 
right outside of the hotel is a place called db bistro moderne the place is known for 32 burger so if you want to splurge and do something different go there 
there is also a 24 hour duane reade convenience store  pharmacy right around the corner from the hotel which has pretty much everything a person in the hotel would want so you always have that option 
the concierge was useless was not able to make any reservations they recommend the touristy spots and was not knowledgeable i had to call amex concierge who got things done i am from the are so i know the places i like",5.0
worst hotel in downtown fort worth,the downtown fort worth courtyard is simply awful i stay in downtown fort worth at least once per month and i always try to avoid this hotel but everything else was booked this time the front desk staff is unfriendly and sometimes down right rude for example they refused to call us a cab instead asking us to wait at the curb until one happened by this was very irritating because cabs are not common in downtown fort worth the rooms are small old tired and dated the bathrooms look no better than something you would expect in a motel 6 the only positive is the location but id almost rather sleep in my car in a parking garage than in a bed in this hotel again,1.0
what a great vibe,"my husband and i spent 2 nights november 1819th in a superior queenwhy is everyone so surprised at the small rooms doesnt anyone google before they go we went expecting small but i asked for a corner unit and they obliged us  2 windows makes a difference if you are getting a priceline deal as we say in kindergarten you get what you get and you dont get upset the breakfast coffee was 400 but it was delicious and served in a large cupwonderful ambiance in the library with the fireplace and new york times  i loved it so glad this wasnt another cookiecutter hotel we were well received at reception and at baggage storagethe design elements of the room were very well done and if you need drawers and extra hanging space for 2  3 days youve packed way too much plasma tv was a real treat
rented bikes just east of hotel and did central park loop 64 miles in 1 hour  im 65 and i was wearing a skirt what a joy it was we will most definitely return",4.0
not even close,this is not a 4 star resort not even close its squeezed between an interstate highway and a busy business thoroughfare roomsuite was good however housekeeping forgot to make up the room one day golf practice range is a joke with plastic balls due to lack of room golf course is marginal gift shopdelipro shopcondo sales all squeezed into one room main restaurant has very limited menu and quality is just ok service was good however savvy vacationers will go northto scottsdale or carefree resorts,3.0
terrible rooms,while the location is very good and the place tried to be hip the rooms are really below what one would expect for a w hotel the room is very small the bed is small the shower is below average the elevator got stuck and the acoustics are poor the hotel staff attempt to make it up by offering champagne upon check in but i would rather they spend the time upgrading the hotel avoid if possible,2.0
best value in nyc had a great stay highly recommended,my family stayed for 9 nights in a 2bedroom suite the accommodation was faultless with clean bedlinen and abundant fresh towels daily rooms are a good size with air conditioning and very comfortable beds there was no noise at all and we had good views over the city roofscape towards the hudson river the hotel is situated in a safe and pleasant neighbourhood with a plethora of excellent restaurants bars fresh fruit markets bakeries bookshops movie theaters etc all close by there is metered parking in the street or plenty of garages to choose from and subway is also nearby the hotel is only 15 minutes by car from yankee stadium or times square and just a few minutes walk from central park and the major museums front desk staff are especially helpful we have stayed in other hotels in nyc in the past but for location and top value we shall return to the belleclaire on our next visit,5.0
i recommend kawada because im stereotyped japanese guy of cleanliness,"actually the size of rooms is very small for average americans maybe right for japanese 
and you do not have many staffs working for you since the management is cost efficient
and good restaurants are away
and a few homeless people walking once in a while on hill street where the hotel is located in summer time open doors out of emergency stairways
however 
this property has no crime 20 years i mean since the owner has purchased this property and remodelled building as hotel i heard
five story old building has no bugs inside isnt it very funny
the cleanliness is much much better than five star hotels such as ritz carlton grandhyatt etc because of good housekeeping staffs and because the top management people is like toyotashondas stepping down to the level of staffs and talks with them which us auto makers would not do
i am running medical clinics in tokyo metro area hiring 20 doctors so sort of cleanfobic and i love this hotel",5.0
what a pleasant surprise,"this hotel was recommended by a friend of mine this is my second recent trip to san francisco the first at the westin on market and now five days in the milano yes the westin is nice but the milano was larger and only a very minor step down in quality but under half the price
i really have no idea what hotel the people who gave this hotel a bad review were staying in this hotel was well above my expectations  i was wondefully surprised
i had a king which faced 5th street the room was huge and bright with with the blinds open but could be sealed up nice and dark the king size bed was comfortable the bathroom was modern well equipped and with tasteful modern decoration the room was air conditioned
i was here for the san francisco folsom street fair weekend and associated goings on around that weekend the hotel was walking distance to the various venues in the area
it is very close to the muni and bart stations powell street on market street  maybe 100 metres if that i read one review complaining about the lack knowledge of the people on the front desk about places to eat  we have internet  thats what yelp is for
i only have a few of criticisms
1 you pay 995 a day for internet or 3995 for a 5 day option  and this is only for one device it is however less expensive that some hotels but not of course free however it did work flawlessly for the five days i was there
2 there is no room safe  though i didnt enquire about whether there was a hotel safe at the front desk
3 the power points are on opposite sides of the large room  i had to move the desk in order that my laptop power cord could reach but perhaps that gives an indication of the size of the room
all in all i would suggest you would have a very hard time finding a hotel of this quality for under 250 a night let alone the approx 120 a night i spent i wouldnt normally review a hotel but i felt compelled to give one in this case i would recommend this hotel without hesitation and certainly say here the next time i am in san francisco
if you cant find it on any of the major hotel booking sites try hotelrescom  its what i used",5.0
second time a charm,"a second visit made all the difference
a couple of months ago i had a miserable experience restaurant closed room adjacent to ice machine indifferent front desk staff 
nonetheless id heard good things and gave the renaissance a second chance and am i glad i did the front desk staff was efficient helpful and pleasant checkin was quick and they referred me to several local restaurants with directions
the room was much improved  larger and nicer than the last stay large flatscreen tv still great but better view of the harbor larger and nicer bath my bath was only a large shower so if you want a tub be sure to ask for it internet connection is easy with the option for a 13 or 17 charge go for the cheaper rate  still very fast
elevators are surprisingly quick hotel decor is modern and bed was very comfortable its easy to work in your room mine had a settee but im not sure a couple would be comfortable here for a long stay
the club lounge is a nice benefit  hors doeuvres in the evening including sushi and shrimp honor bar with many selections free sodas and water magazines and a morethanadequate breakfast there is a 24hour fitness center lap pool and jacuzzi for all guests 
the only down side in my opinion is the restaurant apparently they operate on somewhat of a tapa system for dinner  lots of small portions or something like that it seemed confusing and expensive especially for one person however there are a number of very nice restaurants seafood steak italian within very easy walking distance
as others have stated location isnt an ideal for tourists in that its not close to anything but the water still taxis are prevalent and the water taxi is nearby but if youre in boston for business this hotel caters to you if youre here for pleasure and can get a good rate its definitely worth considering",5.0
an absolute jewel,i will never stay anywhere else while visiting the city everything was perfect from the bellman to the spa,5.0
really good,"we have been traveling for 6 weeks in all this time we have never come across staff that are so attentive as here nothing was too much trouble for example producing a full days itinerary for a days trip to marthas vineyard at 11pm also very cool feeling about it and a great restaurant
the only thing that we would have loved is coffee facilities in the rooms please please",5.0
exceeded my expectations,"after reading some of the mixed reviews i wasnt sure quite what to expect but i must say the ballantyne was everything we were looking for they have the little details down such as warm towels when you check in complimentary valet jacuzzi tubs classical music playing in the room upon arrival and the staff was so attentive i was really impressed i would put it on par with a ritz carlton type place 
the only drawback was that when we arrived at 4 pm our room was not ready and we had to wait until about 430 but they allowed us to check out a little late so it wasnt a big deal the spa was very nice",5.0
not that bad,"i stayed here for 3 nights with my 8 year old daughter yesthe room is very small we went on a cruise in may and the cabin was actually bigger but for us it was ok because after hitting the city all day we were exhausted every night and just crashed the bed is very comfortable the ac worked fine the weird thing was the glass window around the tub with a curtain so you could watch your roomate use the shower if you wanted why and by the way there is no sign on the outside of the hotel telling you that it is the hudson so thankfully i recognized it from the pictures alsothere is no place to put your clothes no dresser no drawers in nightstand nothing there is a place to hang a few thingswe had about 8 hangers so we had to leave our stuff in the suitcase which is ok for a long weekend staff were friendly concierge was able to print our boarding passes for our trip home hailed us a cab loud music in lobby nightly from the club but didnt hear it in the room we were on the 14th floor theres ice machine and vending machines on every floor 15th floor has the terrace with nice scenic views and a place to relax if you get claustrophobic in your room i guess 
great location next to columbus circle subway stop central park is 3 minute walk away 15 20 minute walk to rockerfeller plaza and times square 24 hour cvs on the corner cute diner called the flame was nice for breakfast 
overall i recommend it for a short stay when you just need a place to lie your head at night fine for one person with 2 you tend to trip over each other not recommended for someone with claustrophobia",2.0
should have believed the others on here,my own fault  did not check out reviews on ta before arriving  but was a business trip and last minute at that so really had no time to research  generally i dont take others word for what they say about their visits  its all in the eye of the beholder  but this time  lets just say i wont be back  it was close to my business meeting therefore the reason it was chosen back to staying only in bbs for me,3.0
stay here  do not worry,"just returned tonight from 3 nights in nyc this is the first time we did not stay at the crowne plaza  couldntwouldnt do the 37500 a night they wanted so after a lot of research i used priceline and ended up with the grand hyatt i was apprehensive from the bad reviews but in the end ill say that i would stay again in a minute
we arrived at 1pm and were in our room early by 110 the front desk was extremely friendly 
the room was fine  beds very comfortable everything clean and pretty the room was cleaned every morning on schedule the bathroom was not large but certainly adequate  i have smaller bathrooms in my own home so no big deal
concierge was very helpful along with the bellhop and the men outside the hotel who helped us get taxis
nice to walk over to grand central station without going outside to get a quick snack or lunch starbucks there too
cant say enough  for less than half the price of crowne plaza  ill stay every time",5.0
this is a great hotel,"we went to stay at this hotel for both leisure and business actually the hotel has a great location in a really great part of downtown san diego within a couple of blocks of the gaslamp area the hotel has nice rooms that are comfortable and the staff was very helpful the hotel has a comfortable and modern interior
when we arrived we had a speedy check into a 14th floor room the room was very clean and spacious enough
the beds were comfortable and we had no problems while staying at this particular property
the hotel has a hot barnightclub on the roof that his hopping at night at least on friday and saturdy nights when we were there
we would stay at this hotel again",4.0
fantastic hotel,i like many people was a bit concerned about staying at this hotel after reading the many reviews however upon arrival our room was immediately upgraded to a junior suite  fantastic  it was huge the room was clean and well looked after with coffee making facilities and a useful fridge if you wanted to keep your drinks cool the air conditioning was a little noisy but i would rather have noisy air conditioning than no air conditioning  it was sooooo hot and humid in new york they had a great starbucks coffee shop in the bar until 1100am so you could get coffee obviously and a light breakfast which was really useful the staff on the whole were very helpful and the concierge gave great advice when asked the hotel was situated at 45th and madison which was a great base for getting around the city it was 2 minutes walk from grand central station and 1015 mins walk to times square we would definitely recommend it and hope to stay there again,5.0
not what it used to be  at all,"my husband and i stayed at the palmer house for seven nights during the thanksgiving holiday let me point out that hilton no longer owns the palmer house  a new york outfit bought it a couple of years ago theyre undergoing a huge 150 million renovation and the chicago charm is being killed off in favor of new yorknew york no offense but if i want to go to new york city ill go 
i have stayed at the palmer house dozens of times in the last 40 years the last time prior to this visit was in 2004 we decided to give the palmer house one more try while the 2004 visit certainly lacked lustre this visit was awful i remember the graciousness of the hotel seeing all the staff happy and better yet happy to see you now  we got the distinct impression we were a bother the bellmen and i use the term loosely look at you when you walk it like youre cramping their style we saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps while the bellmen yacked on with eachother in the entire week we were there no one opened the door for us  no one greeted us shame on these new owners dont they know the first thing about customer service first impressions evidently not
the first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains it was horrible and kept us up at night furthermore the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean we had to call housekeeping three times each time they would come they didnt correct the problems we gave up we tried to change rooms but were told the were completely sold out line we made our reservations for this trip in july were hilton honors members  who cares anyway the next day we changed rooms and while the room was better we still experienced problems with water for instance on two mornings the water ran brown with silt not good
the restaurant lockwood did not open until thanksgiving day despite being advertised as opening weeks before we made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior i must say the retaurant is terrible the whole layout stinks the ceilings are far too low the tables are bare no table cloths no flowers no candles stark the flow of the restaurant is tangled at best no one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant its a zigzig game getting to and from not only that but we ate there for breakfast each morning simply because our rate included it and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable there are plenty of waiters hanging about but i dont think the manager has told them what to do yet no salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning no coffee the next morning funny enough we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience no kidding id avoid this place to think the hotel closed the wonderful french quarter restaurant and opened this unforgivable one more thing about this restaurant the weird music choice who wants to hear janice joplin while eating thanksgiving dinner  or any other time for that matter the music was awful rap new age rock ect the manager said they were playing the staffs cds wwhhhhaaat 
for a good restaurant try petterinos the south water kitchen wonderful and harry carays theres also a corner bakery that serves good coffee sandwiches and pastries
lastly the decor is no longer tasteful the lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view there are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables  in the lobby dreadful no relaxation there at all anymore you cannot even walk through it its a circus the carpet choice on the floors we were on 21 and then 15 is hideous i describe at as the stoneout peacock of pinball wizardry i have a feeling potter palmer would flip if he saw this mess
what are these new owners thinking a staff member told us the new owners also bought the old carson pirie scott building directly across the street which closed in february i shutter to think
well with marshall fields selling out to macys carsons closed the berghoff restaurant closed trader vics closed and now the palmer house in complete shambles chicago is sinking fast we sure hate to see it go whats next are they going to raze wrigley field now they seem to be the last man standing goodbye chicago
we did decide on one thing no more hilton hotels for us even though hilton no longer owns the palmer house their name is still attached were sticking with marriott who is fabulous we made the switch after our palmer house trip three years ago
there are plenty of hotel choices in chicago we stayed at the marriott renaissance last year and it was great if we ever get up the nerve to come back to chicago thats where well be staying",1.0
excellent hotel with topnotch customer service,"i have stayed at the hilton w 57th avenue twice in the last 3 months each stay is only getting better the service at this hotel is far and away the best and the nightly rate was a steal for what you get rooms are terrific and location cant be beat
free breakfast was excellent",5.0
overrated unclean room would not recommend,after reading reviews of this hotel i was looking forward to my stay the price was fairly reasonable for a san diego hotel the selling points for me were the free parking and the free breakfast and in that respect it was fine however the room that we were given wasnt cleaned very well the toilet was filthy room wasnt cleaned well mustard packet lying on the floor of the room there was no soap in the toiled and there was an opened shampoo bottle on the bathroom floor we had already hauled our baggage up to the room and were too tired after our long drive to change rooms the next morning we discovered that the water was clogging in the tub very disappointed with this experience thankfully we were staying for one night only the breakfast was good and plentiful and the parking free besides that i cant think of anything good about this hotel definitely would not stay here again,2.0
not my first choice but good valuelocation,"ive stayed here a few times on my business trips this is not my preferred hotel but i must say the staff is very helpful and the location is good  close to greek town although the rooms are pretty updated they need cleaning the wall lamps have lots of dust so maybe they just need to do some deep cleaning
last time i stayed here may i had a pleasant restful stay but previously during the winter months i had a terrible 2night stay my room faced the front of the building so the wind would hit the ac unit and it kept making loud sounds i could not sleep all night the hotel was sold out so i could not move to another room",3.0
very good and very reasonable,"i have just come back from ny this was my first visit the park 79 is very well priced and in an excellent location it is mad busy in the centre of manhatten there are lots of good priced eateries walking distance and the park is just two minutes away as is the subway which is very cheap the room although quite small was spotless and cleaned every day fresh towels daily and the staff were really helpful
i would stay at this hotel again",5.0
nightmare for a person with allergies,this hotel was a baaad choice  first do not make a reservation through ritz it will cost you at least 100 more i was checking rates after i book it and found priceline and other site for at leat 100 less now let me start with positive  the staff is very friendly and pleasant and the lobby looks neat and clean and you have the view of the statue now if you have allergies like me this hotel is a diseaster i wanted room feather free  of course it wasnt and not only that but there was feather on the carpet not sure why it wasnt vaccumed and the worst was ac griddles oh my did it jump start my allergy the dust on it was thick and zesty simply horrible the chair in the room had marks and furniture was so dusty that i left a note for the housekeeper dust writen on it the toilet didnt flush good and there was hair in the bathroom bathroom was nice size just wish it was clean  ooo and i forgot the dirty carpet  so if you consider this hotel make sure you are person who cant see good and has no allergies and youll be fine ,2.0
very nice room  great service  expensive parking,this has to be one of the best hotels that i have stayed in the service was wonderful the fridge was well stocked and the room was very nice the bed was comfortable and the maid service was excellent i would definitely stay here again the only down side  the price per night is on the expensive side and parking is 50 per night the internet is not free  1295 per night,5.0
hotel giraffe a lovely small hotel,"my husband and i spent a weekend in nyc at the hotel giraffe we lived in nyc for many years and wanted to find a charming small hotel instead of one of the big midtown chains we were both very happy with the hotel giraffe 
 the valet parking was quick and the bellman and desk people were very polite and sweet coffee tea capuccino etc were offered throughout the day in the lobby there was wine and cheese at night and a continental breakfast in the am 
 we had a corner suite on the 7th floor with nice views down park avenue what is referred to as a balcony is about 2 feet deep and more like a platform to stand out and get some fresh air the suite itself was nice and fairly spacious it was decorated in subdued neutal tones i would recommend the hotel giraffe for someone who is looking for a small charming hotel",5.0
great location great concierge and lobby is great for business,"enjoyed the hotel was able to get an early check in since i had to get ready after my flight and to a meeting across town  front desk team was great room size was small but good size for what you needit wasnt too small in other words great views from my room and the windows opened so it was nice to get a cool fresh breeze the concierge team was probably the best we needed dinner reservation at saxton and parole and they were able to get our time and suggest a few other places nearby for an after dinner cocktail 
the lobby was great to get some work done while sipping on some coffee and the complimentary wireless internet there were many others doing the same so it was comfortable with great views 
overall i enjoyed my stay and always have fun while at a w hotel",5.0
not safe roaches and holes in the blamkets,roaches i would never allow my family to stay here again please pay a little more and stay elsewhere the bathtubs do not drain so youre standing in old nasty drain water to take a shower i killed a roach on the wall less than 5 minutes upon entering the room the carpet smells funny and the bed blankets have holes in them not a safe area at all  security cameras everywhere and back entrance is near a dumpster the wifi is not strong enough to reach all rooms so you have to go to the lobby to check your email ive stayed at several super 8 motels and this one is well below par i knew it would be loud bc of the airport but therere too many negatives to ever stay here again,2.0
happy parttime new yorkers,"having stayed close to times square last year this was a perfect choice in terms of location just 2 blocks from times square i found the hotel to be modern clean and comfortable the room facilities were in good working order not denying the rooms are small  but your never in breakfast was a bonus with a good selection including cereals pastries bagels  cream cheese or jams fruit juices coffee and tea was also available all day the best thing about this hotel was the service received from the staff on reception they were so friendly and helpful nothing was a problem they enquired various times on line to answer our queries and suggested various eateries bars and ways to get around i would and have recommended this hotel to many people value for money was superb compaired to alot in nyc also location location location
thanks for a superb stay  lynda and diane",5.0
great location,"i read some reviews regarding security and we never had any issues with that our van was parked in their garage for 5 days and was never touched either 
the entire facitlity is worn out but for the price in downtown dc it was tolerable our room had a balcony overlooking the marina and channel it was great sitting out there in the morning and in the evening after a hard day of siteseeing eating meals is difficult the restaurant in the hotel is pricy and there arent many places nearby because they have free access parking at the facility we drove over to arlington or alexandria most nights for dinner and supplies
the location is good too we were only a 20 minute walk from the mall and several memorials and monuments the circulator bus stops right out front and will take you up 7th for only a buck we used it several times to get up to the sites when we had a time issue and about every evening it was a relief to ride back on because of our tired feet and children",3.0
a very good place to stay,"the mosser hotel does not dissapoint on the contrary  i was very positively surprised about this place the room was very small indeed but it was very neat and having all amenities in this price class shared bathrooms were superclean and it was always a fere one available the hotel is located very conveniently right in the centre of downtown but it is also quiet so one can find peace and rest in the room i especially liked the comfy bed after a 15 hours flight staff members at the reception were very friendly and helpful with all my questions
i can definitely recommend this hotel and i will stop by next time i pass through san francisco",4.0
gorgeous roomnice location,"stayed for nine daysservice personnel were very accomodating the room was beautiful  kept well i liked having a small kitchenette and launderette in the room 
 i asked for foam pillows as i am allergic to downfeather pillows and received pillows with some sort of foam chips in them they were very uncomfortable that would be my only negative comment and would suggest they correct this you might want to bring your own foam pillow if you prefer one over a feather pillow",5.0
never again,"the park central hotel is in a great location you can walk practically everywhere that is really unfortunately the only kind thing i have to say about this hotel although our 9th floor room was spacious as far as new york hotels go it was rather well kind of gross i really believe that the overwhelming stench of bleach that greeted us when we first entered our room was supposed to make it appear as if our room had been cleaned after we spent a little time in the room it was quite clear our room had not been cleaned 
the bathroom was the worst the base of the toilet was covered in hair and urine stains there was dust hair and dirt around the baseboards and in the corners there was hair in the shower once used they never replaced the glasses with clean ones there were pink sticky looking stains on the wall above our bed one day they didnt even make up our room despite the fact that we had the please clean our room sign on the door for all we know we were sleeping in a bed with dirty sheets i cant even let myself think about it i believe some of the upper floors have been remodelled so im thinking whatever positive reviews you read about this hotel are from people who stayed on these floors the plasma tv was nice again i think its there to distract you from the grime and the elevators were wacky the entire time we were there sometimes we had to go up in order to go down also the pictures they show of the lobby well the lobby doesnt look like that anymore we didnt eat in their restaurant way too expensive and let me tell you we hardly ever saw anyone in there if you want a great breakfast youve got the brooklyn diner over on 57th just west of 7th and the europa cafe on the corner of 57th and 7th there are just so many other food options and hotel options shop around youve got both sheratons the dream hotel the essex house the w and a lot of other reputable hotels in the midtown area spend a little more stay somewhere else unless of course you dont mind having someone elses hair in your shower",1.0
very pleasant experience and would definately stay again,this was an outstanding stay at the hilton midtown the location was great only a few blocks from times square one way a couple blocks to central park the other way and easy subway access the stay started out wonderfully we had booked a room on the executive level top floors which was a great move it only cost a little bit more but it is well worth it there is a separate check in on the top floor with absolutely no wait we were able to get early check in which was very convienent the physical hotel itself was nice nothing outrageous but nice in the evening they served complimentary appetizersfresh fruitetc which were very good and in the mornings you had continental breakfast when we went to check out the staff kindly offered us a very late check out 500 pm rather than noon this was outstanding because all i was asking for was to check our bags with the bell desk because our flight was not leaving until the afternoon and our original plan was to do some more sight seeing during the day it was a very rainy day so without us even asking for it they offered us this late checkout at no extra charge since we would be pretty misarable walking around the city in the rain the concierge was also extremely friendly and helpful this was a perfect stay and would highly recommend and if you do stay here i would also advise the upgrade to executive level,5.0
good for a night,my family was traveling from georgia to el paso  we stopped here for the night the room upstairs nonsmoking was clean and actually a lot nicer than any other super 8 i have stayed in the front desk employee was nice and there were no problems i didnt feel unsafe in the area but then again we only stayed 1 night it wasnt expensive 52 with military discount but for that much in a super 8 i atleast expected a hot item for breakfast which was the only downside just cereal some fruit  muffins etc we went down the street and had mcds overall it was a decent nights stay,3.0
rewriting history in its rating,"i booked a three night stay with a popular online service it gave the san carlos a 35 out of 5 the rate was about 60 less than a much better name brand hotel around the corner 
when i arrived i was told i did not have a reservation i assured the counter person i indeed had one they were insistant i did not i produced the confirmation number hmm thats not our number
 i produced the booking receipt and asked for the manager after additional explaining and 20 minutes she had to make the reservation on the spot 
i know this hotel had a grand history and boy are they doing their best to keep it just like it was in the 50s
just a short list of deficiencies
uncontrolable shower temp scald to cold in milliseconds 
no heat or cooling control they say just open or close the vent so 170 rooms are treated as one 
the original elevators are old and creaky and i think they were the first one west of the mississippi and slow they even post inside the elevator that they are subject to breaking and to be gentle 
the walls have been pained so many times that its hard to tell where one wall starts and the other ends even so the sound of the next rooms occupants was interesting 
no room service
if they promoted this monument as exactly what it is  a chance to stay in a really historic hotel with 1928 detail and play up the ghost thing even more than they do now some masochistic patrons would love it 
one positive was the wireless was actually fast and free 
pay a little more and
avoid this classic old rundown overpriced uncomfortable relic",1.0
not at all a touristfriendly hotel especially when it comes to asking if an area is safe to walk down,"there are only 3 things good i have to say about this hotel 1 the cleansiness is very good 2 the location made it easy for us to visit the tourist sites and the people at the reception were very nice thats all but i have a lot of bad to say about it
my advise in going to washington dc when it comes to asking what area is safe and whats not and yes every city has good and bad is to do all your research before coming because you absolutely can not ask the people is this area safe at least not at this hotel they get very angry and offended and this happened to me twice in a row the very moment i arrived in the hotel and i even mentioned how there are good and bad areas in every city first time i asked this arts lady and straight away budged in said something like your be fine how about just keep out of the ne part how about that very sharp and rudely and i think also she said something about why are you here then so i thought to myself ill ask someone better if i am not going to be answered nicely so i asked the security guard who was standing around judging the fact he is a security guard so i thought he would be most helpful and he says yeah noones going to kill you or hurt you or anything and i says are you ok and he goes yeah im just a bit ofended you know as if i had that intention to upset them they both knew that every city has good and bad areas and that i was a foreigner a tourist that is not a immigrant who knew nothing about it and the act of being angry and being offended was all put on me ending up throughout the whole vacation holding my breath i have travelled to the usa 8 times now and every time i asked about low and high crime areas and everybody in every place told me and helped me out unlike this hotel i have crap like this in the uk time after time even directed at me and we all get fed up with it i did not save up all that money to usa to experience another uk attitude 
other complaints is that as soon as i arrived i went up to the swimming pool and it was all set out which looked like there was going to be a party ok i understand its a conference hotel but i asked if i could go in the pool and apparently its only for people in this arts thing i could not use the pool the whole time i was there and when the people from the arts group came you could not move in the lobby because it was crowded so much so that we felt that we werent guests anymore the elevator was unmovable at times and they were all drunk i mean very drunk you could not even stand outside in the entrance at night without the crowd screaming about next to you therefore unless you were toat least put up with the outside bit you are limited to your hotel room because you were in the crowds way allthe time you can tell the body language when you walked past the only nice people there really was was the people in the reception they were very nice but the rest i would go as far to say that they need to know how to respond to tourists better even when we were waiting in the lobby for the airport shuttle the people both inside and outside couldnt seem to get rid of us quick enough 
apart from all that there was nothing really in the hotel shopwise apart from a gift shop even there there wasnt much that was worth buying apart from the hotel resturant in which we had to book to get in we had to live on mcdonalds on the other corner of the road
i do sound like a complaining brit here but i would by far consider it worth complaining when you have spent all that money to live your holiday like that
i would never again in my life waste a single dollar pound or euro on even using this hotel even if i won the lottery let alone staying and i would not recommend others to either
disgusting",1.0
mini pineapple cupcakes in the lobby,"nice location with easy access to everything by foot or by car i was most intrigued by their unique mini pineapple cupcakes that welcomed you in the lobby they were a whimsical way to reinforce their brand
the bathroom was my favorite  spacious and sleek the rooms were very clean and the bed was full of pillows you could sink into prop your feet on or just squish as you sleep the night away ill say we didnt spend much time here but we used it as our book end for our trip from seattle to victoria to vancouver and back to seattle we were easily able to walk from here to the space needle pike place the piers and even uphill to queen anne 
i will say their reservations process was not as smooth as the stay  my friend experienced multiple charges and phone calls required to correct it however they did correct it and our stay was comfortable",4.0
on the beach in pacific beach,"i have stayed at the pacific view before  several times  and i find them consistent the place has been upgraded gradually over the years and is still not a fancy place thanks for that  but while spartan it is neighborhood friendly and clean 
ive always had great service and prompt response from the staff whether it is onsite during the stay or via email before or after and theyve always been flexible and accommodating you cannot beat the location if you are looking for being in the middle of things  if you like the beach you really dont have to leave the neighborhood for much of anything the bed seemed new and was very comfortable with good quality linens 
the room furnishings otherwise were almost nonexistent  i would have liked to have had a decent table and chairs  but i made do with a couple of the deck chairs pulled into the room from the balcony outside there was a high table in the room and a couple of plastic stools  one of which had a crackedbroken seat thats about my only criticism  and it would certainly not cause me to look elsewhere  the other positives are numerous this little motel has the feel of a small business  and thats one of the things i like most about it
i opened my windows and had the sounds of the neighborhood california beach culture and the ocean in my room not to mention the cool sea air and sounds of the waves 24 hours a day there are many great places to eat within easy walking distance i love you pacific view inn ill be back soon",4.0
nice room served its purpose lobby is too crazy for me though,i probably wont stay here again considering its size and the chaos of the lobby the lines to check in and out was 20 people deep each person taking a total of 20 minutes to a half an hour the front desk person i got after waiting in the line for nearly an hour or more was a nasty nasty woman by the name of joy dealing with her was a very unpleasant experience given her hard alpha woman attitude she addressed me as a man calling me sir after asking for my id that clearly says im female the trip to the hotel was horrendous as i arrived at port authority  115 and finally got up to my room around 345 leaving me no time to enjoy my day in the city before having to get ready for an event in the evening,3.0
great location no bed bugs horrible wifi comfy bed needs updating,"not very modern
rooms could be remodeled but hey  its nyc
no breakfast includedbut there is a starbucks 1 block away
great location2 blocks from 96th street subway stop and you can take the express red 1 subway from times square so it takes maybe 10 minutes to get there from times square alsoonly 3 or 4 blocks from central parkgreat place to run early in the morning
wifi was really badhad to go to starbucks bed was very comfortable
i was in room 212 very quiet corner room so was very large
asked for a room with 2 single beds got a queenkind and wasnt charged for the upgrade no bed bugs
dont wait to book 2 nights beforehandyoull get ripped off",3.0
well worth it,"me and my wife stayed in the donatello in sept 2008 and it was a great start to our california holiday the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was large bright clean and comfortable really god bed too which is important to us i used the gym a couple of times which is a little small but functional unlike some other reviewers we didnt have any problems with noise from the street even though it was friday and saturday and we could see the entrance to a nightclub from our 15th floor window
the only negative is the breakfast its fine if youre happy with coffeee croisants bagels fresh fruits and gooey gunky sweet muffins but the breakfast room itself is very small and nowhere near able to seat all the guests who come in so most ended up taking their breakfasts to their rooms to eat again fine if you dont mind doing that but something to be aware of
location is very good and it seems quite critical we popped over to look at the hotel california which is only a couple of blocks away and one we were considering staying at but those couple of blocks make a big difference the neighbourhood takes a swift dive for the worse into a world of liquor stores and downbeat people hanging out on corners not exactly romantic but the area immediately around the donatello is fine
overall then a very nice hotel for the price and in a great location",4.0
beware of thief,i left diamond earrings on nightstand and they were stolen so a thief works for the hotel i realize it was my mistake in leaving them but the hotel needs to find out who is robbing guests i filled a claim with hotel that was turned down big surprise they said no unauthorized entries in room but had the incident date wrong hotel handled event poorly no one called back after i reported theft i had to make several phone calls and emails before i heard from hotel i am sorry that i gave housekeeping generous tips before they robbed me also taken were other personal items such as soda beer and snacks,3.0
amazing in every way,"my wife and i received a free night from hotelscom after staying 10 nights elsewhere over the past year we chose the fanciest fivestar hotel in san diego the grand del mar we stayed between christmas and new years expecting a crowd but the hotel felt rather empty nonetheless the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating the hotel itself is part of a resort that includes a worldclass golf course four swimming pools a spa at least two restaurants and a comfortable lounge 
our room was by far the most plush luxurious entrylevel room weve ever experienced the bed was heavenly with down pillows and turndown service the flatscreen hdtv was huge our bathroom featured marble counter tops a sunken tub separate large shower and even a television we loved the grand del mar",5.0
very uncomfortable stay,before arriving we had a change in plans we contacted the hotel and requested that one of our rooms contain two double beds instead of one king they informed us on three different occasions that this would not be a problem we also told them that if we could not switch rooms for whatever reason we would like a rollaway bed because on their website it stated that these were available upon request upon arrival 70 park informed us that there was no such conversation made with them about switching the rooms note both my wife and myself spoke with the hotel several days prior to arrival we were also told by managment that in order to get a rollaway bed we would have to had contacted them days before so they could make arrangments to get one from another hotel we checked into our room which we were told that it was upgraded because of the inconvience only to find that we couldnt even walk around the room without one of us sitting on the bed because lack of space we also found that our toilitries were opened and used there was hair in the sink and the bathtub as we turned back the sheets for bed we found hair all over the sheets we contacted the front desk and found out that because it was christmas they had let all of their housekeeping staff leave a manager showed up to the room with sheets in hand but it took her almost an hour to make the bed i even had to help her there was not any thermostat control and it was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open in 20 degree weather 70 park also doesnt believe in changing the sheets daily you must request this service that was obvious our first night also if you would like to have a drink at the bar downstairs a glass of house wine will set you back 15 note half a glass we travel every 4 months to nyc and thought we would try a new area of town and this hotel is not worth the money comparable to other hotels in midtown manhattan we do not expect to have service and quality that we receive in our own homes however cleanliness is a huge issue if you can stand the filth you may be able to stand 70 park,1.0
great location ,ideal to get to a the popular sites staff friendly and rooms fit for purpose nice and quite too for such a central location breakfast on the terrace restraunt  7th floor looking out on rockefeller centre was pleasant affair would definitely go back an happy to recommend it,4.0
good for the money,good location good bed great value for money not an immaculate place but if you can deal with that its fine it did smell a little if you are after 5 star luxury stay somewhere else if all you are going to do is sleep and shower its fine service at reception was blunt but efficient they offered us a later check out which was appreciated,3.0
great hotel,new hotel nice modern furnishings similar layout to springhill suites but slightly larger rooms refrig and microwave in rooms breakfast available in the mornings for a feebar open at night this hotel is just across the street from a large mall with numerous chain restaurants only a few minutes off the highway,5.0
beware of this hotel,i should have read reviews beforehand abnormal billing is rightwe used travelocity where you prepay and the hotel still charged then at the front desk claimed it was not doublecharging went home and checked online banking yes they doublebilled travelocity has a guarantee to fix things but that was an hour on the phone with the hotel thru them then since the only incidental should have been 24day parking chargewhich is high they debited my account a 50 hold for parking instantly but the credit to my account will be seen in 25 days and with some banks they said can take 23 weeks well luckily i use bank of america it should be soon but this is ridiculousi attempted while there to reconcile at the front desk and they said oh dont worry we wont doublecharge forget this hotel you can not trust them and yes reaching the accounting department is impossible you get voicemail and they dont ever call you back good thing i atleast had travelocity to deal with them for me or who knows what would have happened,2.0
noisy freight trains and bad location between highway and train,"my company booked a room there for me i was very disappointed by the noise during the night due to the freight trains and also by the location as again due to the trains there is no way to reach the domain area just 200 feet from the hotel you need to take your car and do several miles to go to a restaurant at that place there is also no way to eat or drink something in the hotel
otherwise it is clean with a good breakfast there is an outdoor pool and hot tub
i do not recommend that hotel",2.0
very reasonable choice,"this hotel at lombard street is a good option when visiting san francisco we had no major complaints but we missed a refrigerator also no breakfast was served the room was clean the staff was friendly the relatively large room had a somewhat somber appearance but was otherwise ok lombard street is busy and there is certainly some traffic noise in the room at least in front side rooms wifi worked well car parking is free it takes about 45 minutes to walk to fishermans wharf and about an hour to the boats leaving for alcatraz however you will have no problem getting a taxi in lombard street 
there is a nearby stop for the san francisco doubledecker sightseeing bus 
taken into account that hotel prices in sf are relatively high the overall pricequality balance was good",3.0
average hotel good location,what i look for in hotels is location and price the gaylord was fairly inexpensive and seemed to be in a good location which is why we chose it the location was actually pretty good within walking distance to the center of sf and to some attractions eg crookedest street one slight issue with it is the close proximity of it to the dodgy area but as long as you dont wander off its fine the rooms were clean enough and suited us we were there to see the city not the hotel but if going back to san francisco i probably would spend a little more money for a nicer hotel,3.0
great comfort and full of room,this hotel is located very convenient to the airport has a massive amount of room in each suite and is very comfortable the inner plaza was very nice and there were fire pits to sit around what shocked me the most about the hotel was its affordable price in my opinion it offered a better deal than any other hotel of its kind in phoenix considering what it offered,5.0
great service,"literally every person on the hotel staff whom i encountered at the hotel commonwealth was friendly helpful and just good old fashioned courteous including front desk staff doormen housekeepers and roomservice whether i needed more pillows or scrambled eggs after breakfast hours or even a wheel chair without an advance notice each request was fulfilled promptly and politely after i said thank you the typical reply was with pleasure 
also great fitness room with new high end equipment
very convenient for parents of boston university students suggestion quieter rooms on the higher floors further from traffic noise below on highway 90 on one side and commonwealth ave on the other
located at kenmore square t station",4.0
basic and a tad expensive,"this hotel is not good value for what you pay it is clean and the amenities are very basic  nothing to write home about i am guessing the rates tend to be high because people need to stay close to hospitals they need to visit if it werent for convenience no one would stay here 
boston has a great public transportation system if you are traveling on leisure there are better hotels and better locations",2.0
ok hotel good location,i have stayed in this hotel several times in the past 5 years i have never had an awful experience some of the queen bed rooms are small this trip i stayed in a room with two double beds for the first time the room was larger as was the bathroom the drawback was we were right over the cta bus stop outside however when we put the ventailing system on fan and created a somewhat noisy white noise we were fine the breakfast had actually improved since i had last stayed about 2 years ago the offerings were ok nothing special there are some good breakfast places to eat nearby if you dont care for what they offer all in all not a bad place to stay if you want to be in the lincoln park area,4.0
thank you ritz for a topnotch getaway,"my girlfriends and i met there for a onenight stay to celebrate our friendship to bask in the luxury of all things ritzcarlton to savor a few drinks and tasty food and to enjoy watching some college football together yes we love our pigskin all missions were accomplished in a way that has set the bar higher than any other hotel weve visited together when it came time to depart we didnt want to check out 
frankie checked me in at the front desk and i couldnt have asked for a more pleasant check in he is the kind of employee any business would love to have  exceedingly polite friendly smart and efficient i was impressed i asked about paying a fee for an upgrade and he quickly accommodated my request with a reasonable fee i told him that my girlfriends and i were meeting in charlotte to enjoy life spend time together and watch the football game that night on tv and mentioned we wanted to see virginia tech win i had a spa appointment to get things started so he suggested he have someone deliver my bags to the suite so i could start enjoying the spa excellent plan frankie 
i had a deep tissue massage in the spa and quite simply that rocked the whole spa experience was exactly what i needed there is a full body shower at least one regular shower some quiet areas a steam room and a sauna room the whole area was spotless and the attendants were available when needed but not intrusive they werent hovering around the spa area all the time which can be awkward if one is partially dressed andor make one feel rushed to leave but there was always help at available at the very closeby front desk when i booked the appointment the attendant had mistakenly left me on hold for a really long time so when i checked in she gave me a small gift to apologize which was not needed but very kind of her to do my friends and i met in the spa and spent a lot of time just chilling out which we sorely needed one of my friends also had a massage and gave it a thumbs up
next i saw our room  and wow was it a room it was the most beautiful hotel suite ive ever seen it was incredibly spacious with a separate bedroom with two queen beds and a large living room area the decor was immaculate with original artwork and beautiful furniture the bathroom was huge and featured rich marble decor with a shower with a glass door a tub and a toilet room my friends and i felt like celebrities  it was that vip on the desk in the living room area was a bottle of complimentary champagne with a note from frankie wishing us well for a fun evening in the hotel and even a go hokies message now that is how a hotel rocks out the customer service we felt cared for and important 
we tried to hit the urban sip but it was closed due to a private party i love that place so it made me a little bummed that i couldnt share that experience with my friends who had not been there before but who could be disappointed in the ritz when we were having the kind of experience we were having
we ended up having drinks and some light food downstairs at the bar it was a great scene for people watching and relaxing and it was pretty hopping even for a weekday it was thursday night the appetizer specials are reasonably priced we watched the hokies start the game on the tv at the bar then went in the restaurant for dinner where we could continue to watch the game and eat the food there was quite good and service was excellent 
in fact we had such a great experience at the hotel that we ended up staying there all night and not leaving the hotel at all when it came time to crash the suite was completely quiet and the beds were like little clouds of heaven  an a sleeping experience 
thank you to frankie the spa staff and everyone else who made our visit truly exceptional i hope my friends and i will be able to find the time to rendezvous there again soon the charlotte ritz is the kind of place that truly offers an experience versus just lodging and that was exactly what we needed",5.0
very good but there is a twist,"nice digs for the price and here are the good things
buffet awesome in the mornings saturday they get behind but still good
parking lot is great costs 22 per day but still ok
managers reception awesome great deal cocktails and pupus
location is easy find
weight room and pool good deals too
business center is all free nice but had to wait to use it 3 stations 
now this is all great with one exception internet access in the rooms and suites is per ip address what the heck as a family we had three pcsand had to pay for each day for all three pcsnot customer friendly 
other hotelsone code is for the room and use 1 2 or 3 pcs cmon break down and take care fo the customers",4.0
worth it for 150 per night or less,my husband and i stayed at the palace for memorial day weekend the lobby and dining area of the hotel are beautiful we were in a grand deluxe room which was ok if i were to go back i would spend less on the smaller room bc the only difference seemed to be a higher ceiling and a few extra feet of space the rooms are clean and old elegant but the bathrooms are small and need an update there was no turn down service we mentioned this at the front desk our last night and they said you have to request it no one told us in the beginning the concierge was not very helpful and actually recommended a restaurant that was overpriced and poor quality aqua the palace is in a very good location but there are plenty of other choices in union square breakfast is outrageously priced 60 for two room service is a fortune as well overall the hotel is charming and we had a pleasant stay were not ones to spend much time at the hotel and we didnt visit the pool or anything only book it if its a bargain,4.0
listen to the food comments,"take note of the other reviews when they talk about food
the hotel is pretty good rooms clean large well maintained etc reasonable bar although theres not much atmosphere
only down side is that in the evening the restaurant trys to pretend to be somthing its not the menu is a bit fancy and doesnt really live up to what it promises breakfast is ok but no more and if its busy the service at breakfast is patchy
for dinner your better off going to pf changs which is a 100 yard walk through the car park
all in all is does what a hotel of this standard should do",4.0
this hotel is not finished,"stayed here nearly a month after the hotel completed construction but it is still very much under construction ive stayed in worst hotels  but this hotel wasnt worth the cost
we had to change rooms 3 times
there are two elevators to service 30 floors prepare to wait on one day they had one evevator closed for construction use only
elevators stopped working entirely during the stay 24 floors is a long walk down
on day of check in concrete was being pored on a closed sidewalk i had to call the front desk to figure out how to get into the hotel
construction workers everywhere
wires hanging from wall
had to wait 30 minutes to ice as they ran out and had to go out to buy some
so there are some positives
the rooms are nice and very quiet especially for new york theyre not large but large enough the staff was friendly and apologetic but i think they have to be used to apologizing by now new york is a big city with tons of hotel options and for the cost id stay somewhere else",2.0
not worth the moneythere are others with better service for the same price,my first introduction to the hotel was the restroom in receptionit was dirty and not of the standard i would expect for a hilton hotel the staff were not particularly friendlythey seemed to have a take it or leave it attitudeand werent very friendly and the noise from the construction was bad and it goes on all night ps the hotle staff lie to guests about what time the construction starts and endsi wont stay here again,2.0
i could live in one of these lovely suites,i have stayed at ss several times over the last 3 years i love the rooms the staff and the facility i highly recommend it close to many fabulous restaurants and shopping in hillcrest close to 8 5 and 163 the zoo balboa parkcant beat it for the price and the staff are friendly and helpful,5.0
clean hotel but terrible location,"i just got back from my trip to detroit and i had stayed at hotel st regis for 1 night thankfully it was just one night the hotel is quite an old architecture and is located in a neighborhood that appears to be quite shady i arrived on a sunday and found the neighborhood to be deserted although the hotel is located not very far from downtown i was terribly disappointed to know that there was only one eatery across the street i went around the block trying to look for a decent place to eat or order my food from but found it hard to believe that near a bug hotel like that there was one fast food store happy pizza and a chinese take out place none of them seemed to be decent places to eat i saw plenty of suspicious looking people walking around people who looked like they had doped and drunk for days gleefully the city police department is a block away the only saving grace was a cvs phramacy from where i ended up getting chips and soda for lunch the hotel menu is terrible
as far as the rooms are concerned they were clean beds were comfortable i am saying beds because in the room i was initially assigned the conditioner started making a noise and i could not sleep further so i called the front desk person who told me that he would send someone to my room after waiting for about 30 minutes i went downstairs to ask if someting could be done about it i was surprised when her said is it still making noise and i thought to myself you said youd send somebody and now you expect the conditioner to get fixed by itself then he quickly assigned me to another room and called someone to accompany me to the room to make sure everything in the room was ok the other room was alright but i was surprised that not a single word of apology was mentioned for the inconvenience caused
the hotel looked desserted and at night in the lobby when i went down to report the conditioner making noise i heard the sound of glass being shattered as if someone was repeatedly banging a heavy glass object with a hammer at 23 minute intervals from the private party room the whole time i waited in the lobby there were no lights on in that room the front desk person went inside the room and brought back someone else with him and that person quietly went and sent down in the lobby waiting area it felt a little strange
2 positive things they let me check in earlier than the hotel check in time and check out a little after the check out time hence i give a 3star rating
bottom line plus  clean rooms and spacious bath rooms minus  old building malfunctioningnonfunctioning gadgets in rooms poor location with very shady activities in and around the premises poor options for dining personnel can improve on courtesy",3.0
we can recommend it,we were looking for an unexpensive hotel in the san diego area and found ramada we did not got disappointed it has everything you need to stay some days in san diego the customer service was very polite and helpful the room and bathroom were very clean the breakfest was ok i was happy abputh the tasty yogurt and fruits we can recommend it,5.0
a wonderful oasis of calm in the middle of manhattan,my husband and i spent a week at the library hotel in late august i discovered it through this site and thought it sounded lovely the fact that im a diehard booklibrary fan helped make the sale it was everything i had hoped for and more ive stayed at many different hotels all over ny and this is by far my favorite the room was small but very well designed so it didnt feel cramped also there are so many wonderful places to hang out particularly the spacious 2nd floor lounge area which offers free breakfast wine  cheese monsat evenings and coffeeteacookies throughout the day theres a starbucks across the street but you wont need it since there is also an espresso machine that makes a yummy cappucino the free business center with computerprinter was also welcome so i could check my email every day without having to track down an internet cafe i never bring a laptop with me when im on vacation but i do like being able to stay connected at least a little bit i also appreciated the fact that there are only 6 rooms per floor so its much more quiet than larger hotels where people are coming and going at all hours i never heard a peep from outside our room times square is an easy 10minute walk away and with grand central practically right next door its always easy to find a cab or take the subway highly recommended i definitely plan to return to the library hotel,5.0
clean room  good service,we spent the week of july 4th 2012 at the boston sheraton the rooms were clean and fairly nice we were at this hotel for a convention and the hotel handled everything quite well the location is good with access to the charles river and bikerunning trails the hotel is less than a block from a subway station which turned out to be a really quick and easy way to get around the hotel is also connected to a shopping mall with a grocery store nearby which saved a ton of money on food the restaurant in the hotel was waaay too expensive for us as we had two children with us the lobby has free computers and a starbucks and the concierge station the room we had was large enough with two beds  smaller than queen size but the bathroom was tiny the door on the bathroom took up almost so much space that you had to stand on the toilet to close the door once you were in i used the gym everyday and it was stocked with plenty of high quality equipment although the thermostat was broken and it was really hot and humid i would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again,4.0
both stays deligthful staff housekeeping restaurant lounge,"we stayed at the plaza hotel for part of our honeymoon so we have set some high expectations having visited nyc several times over many years once we discovered the charms of downtown and this hotel we have no desire to stay up in midtown again we have stayed at the millinium for the past 2 octobers for a long weekend thursday  sunday and highly recommend it 
noise has not been an issue on either stay but we are typically out on the town by 900 and its so wonderfully quiet at night weve always had toplevel service from everyone and in the past year there does not seem to be many changes we recognized several people who made our fist stay and now our second stay so enjoyable this stay andrey of the front desk was a standout helping me set up the initial reservations and then was so helpful when i made some changes as many other reviews pointed out the rooms are larger than most even the bathroom the view of downtown the river etc remarkable my husband is a hilton honor member so wifi was free
we are comfortable taking the subway so we are a quick ride to times square central park theaters the met etc more importantly for us the hotel is within walking distance of tribeca and if we are up for a longer walk or even a very short subway ride we can span across the island and visit soho the village little italy wonderful nighttime walk and chinatown a must on a saturday morning 
this trip we took our nephew a firt visit for him to nyc and we could walk to battery park for the traditional tour of lady liberty and ellis island we enjoy seeing and even running across the brooklyn bridge such a stunning engineering accomplishment 
previous trip i used the fitness center and it was well maintained i have not been to the pool my 21 year old nephew dressed up from a night on the town with us went to the first floor lounge when we returned back to the hotel from dinner the bartender chatted with him about my nephews upcoming life plans and it made for a good im on my own and finally an adult experience it solidified for my nephew how easy it is to visit nyc and that people are friendly",5.0
luxury and value,excellent service from all concierge was very helpful to these first time dc visitors housekeeping staff was very stealthy while servicing our room twice daily the bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably sizedwe were there 8 days the bathroom was upscale with quality fixtures stone and glass and plush towels traveling around town was easy with cabs always at the ready and only 1block to the metro the white house was an easy 3 block walk a nice large park was onehalf block away and there were a variety of eateries within walking distance the food and service in the hotel restaurant was superb one minor inconvenience was the limited drawer space in the room the only negative in our stay was the hotel bar where service was extremely slow and they did not offer frozen drinksdaquri margarita etc,4.0
diamond in the rough,we just got back from this wonderful hotel we had 4 kids and two adults and loved it it is brand new and beautiful we had a two bedroom suite with no kitchen the shower had double heads which made it easier to shower more than one child at a time on the weekends they have a nice breakfast homemade waffles muffins bagels juices and coffee there is a computer for your use with no charge there is also a hotel cat that just adds to the whole ambience although you cant get into the ocean from there it is still a lovely setting very quiet and quaint the hotel staff is very accommodating and friendly driving to the hotel i was questioning where we were going but once there it was definitely a fine i would definitely stay here again,5.0
in our moment of griefsheraton was there to comfort us,we made a lastminute reservation with the sheraton four points lax due to our mother being taken to the hospitaland subsequently being admitted to the intensive care unit we booked a block of three rooms for family members who were taking turns holding roundtheclock vigil by my mothers side the entire staff witnessed 10 family members going in and outexhaustedcryingand at the hotel just long enough for the 2hoursleep shifts we scheduled this went on for 7 long daysnights until out mother passed away in my 10 years of being a frequent travelerand staying at every major hotel chaini have never experienced the kindness and accommodation offered to us by everyone we encountered at this starwood hotel justin the manager is exceptional and we thank him and his entire staff from the bottom of our hearts whenever my family travels  well be staying at starwood hotelsand when in the los angeles areano matter the glitz of other hotels or the offerwell be at the sheraton four points lax sheratonyou and your employees are nothing short of wonderful thank you,5.0
beyond convience,our stay at the colonade in boston was excellent the location is amazing the prudential t stop is right outside the front door the entrance to copley place and prudential shopping areas are right on either side of the hotel there are many great places to eat right there centrally located to all parts of the city service by all employees was extremely friendly and helpful they would slways smile graciously open doors and welcome you when going in and out rooms are clean and furnished nicely i wish it was not so expensive to stay in boston but this hotel is priced in line with the others nearby i would definitely recommend this hotel,5.0
i love the ace hotel,"my boyfriend and i have spent many nights at the ace hotel over the years and i couldnt be fonder of the place that said we hadnt been there in at least a year when we realized our keys were locked inside my apartment sometime last month it was after midnight and the resident manager had apparently gone to bed so we walked into the ace and were immediately checked in to a simple room with windows overlooking wall st at the reasonable nightly rate of 8900 check in was quick simple and casual 
i was sad to see that the chess board in the lobby was gone but they do have a computer available for guest use and a hip selection of complimentary magazines our room did not have a private bathroom just a sink the shared bathrooms were clean white and spacious and there was never a line to use them
the complimentary breakfast is quite possibly the best thing about the seattle ace hotel its self serve available from 611am and delicious the breakfast room is accessible to guests at all hours and is equipped with a snack machine coffee a microwave dishes and a coin op washer and dryer 
there are a couple rooms that are really cool 116 features a spinning glass mirror wall between the bathroom and bedroom as well as a private terrace if i recall correctly and 128 as well as others has a sexy glass wall between the shower and bedroom many of the rooms feature shepard fairey type stencils on the walls and minimal modern furnishings",5.0
stylish and new,"arriving in houston after dark with no reservation we stopped at a few hotels in the galleria area they were either completely booked or over our budget at the courtyard we were pleasantly surprised that the price was 99 plus a fee to park that was less than the others for an additional 10 charge we added a hot breakfast for two
the front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful both when checking in and out everything was new squeaky clean and beautifully decorated
the breakfast was a buffet with eggsomelettes prepared to order served on real dishes with real eating utensils",4.0
the best boutique for the miracle mile,"our family stayed here for two nights in march the hotel is clean friendly and run very professionally the location is right next to nordstroms and within an easy walk of all the miracle mile shops
the doormen were helpful in arranging transport to the museums and the blackhawks game
the rooms are bright quiet and very clean
a lot of the guests were there on business or were from europe with lent itself to a very efficient stay which is what we liked 
the presupper drinks and morning coffee were a treat the restaurant in the hotel has top rated food although skip the coffee for breakfast as it free in the lobby
we shall definitely return and highly recommend this hotel",5.0
best location,this hotel is just the perfect place you do not have to walk outside to get to the metro the lobby is gorgeous the rooms are fabulous the service is great and the white house is within walking distance so many other sites are within walking distance as well china town is a couple of blocks away and they have many good restaurants at reasonable prices if you are thinking of taking your family to washington dc this is the hotel to stay at great spot,5.0
mixed review,we choose this hotel due to all the trip advisor reviews the location is great and the hotel size was just what we were looking for no lines for the elevator or lines for breakfast etc the rooms were clean and spacious and staff very attentive our only concern was the noise in the roomwe were on the 10th floor but we did not sleep a wink taking this in consideration that its nyc but we have stayed at other hotels before and we did not hear the street noise like this one sorry to say we would not stay here again,3.0
always welcomed,i have stayed at this hotel only three times all three times there hasnt been a line to checkin moreover two times i was offered a suite and im only a hh gold member the executive lounge is well stocked and elegant great prices last time was under 90 free private shuttle to lax nice pool and jacuzzis carls jrs burgers next door what more do you want,5.0
good but some minus,"stayed there 26 august  4 september
room is clean bed sare good as is bathroom staff is friendly
but the person after the desk is very important 
we recieved a call that there was no more money on the creditcard and that i had made some phonecalls so immediate payment was ordered going down it was a woman on the desk she saw that the creditcard attached to the room was the wrong one 
 the confirmation for the picking up for the airport person on the desk refused to do it had to make the phonecals ourself after that we saw another person make the phonecalls for the clients 
 halfempty of empty shampoo and douchegel not always replaced
 glasses not always replaced so shortage of glasses when drinking something a the chamber
probably typical of new york but the airco outside made a terrible noise
 something to consider as i was on holiday i did not have my portable with me so the internetaccess in the room was for me useless there are 2 computer available but they charge 8 for 10 minutes the possibility of free internetaccess woudl be nice
do not expect a wow but it will do",3.0
nice hotel will stay there again,clean rooms free wifi was surprised how close it is to michigan ave will stay there again for sure i didnt have extra time to do other things parking garage is right next door only gripe they should validate the parking fee other than that no complainants,5.0
comfortable but hard to get too,we enjoyed our room at the hyatt place in austin very much it was spacious and comfortable the hotel is not however in a convenient location you have to work your way through a maze of highway ramps access roads and city streets and one wrong turn puts you into confusion the hotel advertises itself as being easily accessible to downtown but this is not the case the hotel is not in central austin but rather in north austin to get to downtown you have to take i35 which will be a parking lot at rush hour to get back to the hotel you have to work your way through the maze the hotel breakfast was way above average except for the coffee they say it is starbucks but what we had was weak and tasteless the staff was very helpful and polite we probably will not be back it is just too inconveniently located,3.0
well located nice hotel,perfect location close to times square but in quiet street very comfortable room and bed bathroom something special staff friendly and helpful wifi wouldnt work in our room on top floor but good access to computers and printer in lobby walking distance to good restaurants,4.0
fantastic hotel brilliant location,"we visited san francisco for our honeymoon and chose this hotel for its value for money and location  the price we paid for the donatello was very reasonable compared to a lot of hotels in san francisco especially in the union square area we stayed for 4 nights in total our room was on the 8th floor and was a lovely spacious room including a fridge coffee machine flatscreen tv safe iron and plenty of storage space there was even a turndown service provided every evening i have noticed a few people commenting on the rooms being noisy due to street noise however during our stay this was not an issue as we barely noticed any noise
all staff were very pleasant and happy to help with any questions we had on the top floor of the hotel was a club lounge which had free tea and coffee a lounge terrace gym and jacuzzi all included in the price of the room we didnt eat in the restaurant however we did visit the bar once and would recommend you go at happy hour as drinks could be pricey outside of then all in all this was a great hotel and if we visit san francisco again we would definately come back",5.0
horrible should get no star,just needed somewhere to stay for the night while we were in town expedia set us up with this room over the phone so we had no pictures of the place or anything  we figured a room for 100 dollars would be decent enough to just sleep in we arrive at the motel hoping the rooms look better than the outside of the motel go inside and we look at each other like really i wouldnt of even paid 50 for this room i didnt feel safe at all here we slept with a chair up against the door the carpet was filthy i didnt even walk on it without shoes the tv had porn on channel 4 it was just a very unpleasant place to stay at i was upset with expedia that they would even recommend anyone to this hotel  especially after reading all these reviews yuck  when morning came i was so glad to get out of that hell hole,1.0
the quality i had come to expect from the westin is gone,"i booked a terrace suite and looked forward to arriving since i was a frequent customer about 3 years ago and my experience was always great boy was i disappointed the valet team has been changed and they are nonchalent and i finally had to ask them to come over to the car to give me a hand i went inside and the service desk personnel were professional and courteous and so were the bellmen
 i received my room key and went up and the room was clean and neat the heaven beds are truly heavenly and the complimentary amenities were very nice it was at night that things went wrong it was a cold night for la and when i tried to turn on the heat in the bedroom it didnt work i called down a guy came up got the fan to work and said it should warm up in a while it didnt not only that but when i called back he never returned it was like an icicle i called the front desk asked for a floor heater or just extra blankets if they couldnt get it working but they said they had neither and there was nothing they could do but send the guy back up i feel asleep on the living room couch since it was warm in there and if he came i didnt hear him the next morning i was greeted with a cold shower because there was no hot water i was told they were working on the boiler but by 1130 am still no hot water so i took a cold shower and realized the westin i had known was no more i would have to think long and hard about spending money with the westin la anymore and thats sad since i used to be a gold member",2.0
hyatt grand in downtown,hyatt is grand in downtown sfo the place is really big and you are very impressed by the first looks very good to stay for business travelers going to sfo but not that good if you are all alone in the town for the first time,4.0
great place to stay,overall a great hotel recently built with stylish rooms and a cool bar on the roof overlooking the city walking distance to the gaslamp and if you feel you need to walk off the sunday brunch at the del you can walk to the aircraft carrier museum,5.0
great hotel with even better service,"this is one of the better marriott properties that ive travelled to over the years the hotel was upscale and inviting and the people were terrific this was our anniversary and the staff made every part of the experience great from choosing a great room with a view of the city to sending up a bottle of wine to help us celebrate probably the most helpful person there was nash he was always available for assistance no matter what we needed and sent up a great card thanking us for choosing the jw and wishing us a happy anniversary what a great touch
the only negative part of the trip was the loudness of the city im not sure the hotel could do much there but many times we woke up at 3am with the banging of trash trucks or people on the streets not sure if better windows would help or not but minor in the scope of things",5.0
gigahotel but with good and kind service,this is one of the biggest hyatt hotels in the us the room is very good and clean attended to a meeting in the hotels convention center  that is giga too the elevators get crowed several times during the day due to the peolple attending to the convention center the location is perfect close to all shops and in front of the chicago tribune building also in front is the pier to the boat sigthseeings  a must in chicago cons when checking out there was a fee for receiving packages i had bought a book from amazon when i complained that there was no mention of that in the web site  they just removed it from my bill,4.0
good value for area,"i came to stay at this hotel as part of a conference out of the options available for my conference and checking nearby hotels not part of the conference this hotel is a good value for the price the location is in the financial district but on the border of a not so nice area it is a good location to walk to different places nearby and to get to the bart also the hotel is a short walk to the cable cars if you want to a nice ride up to fishermans wharf
the hotel room itself was average the bathroom was a bit outdated i was on the top floor with a view of the hotel pool which can get quite noisy if children are playing in the pool there was also a persistent sound that i relate to hearing an automatic garage door opening and closing at all times was heard from my room i know my room was a couple doors down from their service elevator and the smell of garbage was drafting down the hall during my stay one of the ice machines close to my room was not working which isnt a big deal but i thought id mention
there is a starbucks and restaurantbar as part of the hotel i would recommend if youre here for a conference avoid the hotel starbucks hilton honors club members receive free certificates to starbucks which makes it really busy in the mornings there is another starbucks down a blockor try the boudins down a couple of blocks for a more san francisco experience
the service was as expected the staff tried to reduce the lines at check in and tried to help different requests their emergency guest toiletries spare toothbrush toothpaste etc was a bit sparse but there is a convenient store across the street 
the gym is adequate with updated machines and weights this hotel does have a supershuttle stop outside with vans leaving frequently without having to make a reservation it also is not difficult to get a taxi from this location
i guess i expected more from this hilton chain but it was a fine average experience",3.0
great hotel solid location,"wandering around unfamiliar cities is one of my favorite traveling pastimes and the area around the grant is terrificlots of local flavor in the bars and restaurants nearby
the hotel itself was quite nice though they gouged us for parking i also found the room to be a bit on the small side having written that i would stay here again in a minute wonderfully comfy beds nice and friendly staff and cool amenities",5.0
terrible customer service,my husband and i stayed for our anniversarylocation is just ok water view is a fish pier we had a terrible encounter with security we were not offered any kind of customer satisfactionthe pool was freezing and there was no jacuzzi or hot tub not a very well run hotel we stay in boston very often and learned a lot staying here would pay the extra to stay somewhere else,2.0
almost perfect everything only avoid the room 222,i was there in august 2012 in the hottest period of the year generally i can say that the hotel and his suites are perfect for stay in dc the rooms are spacious and well equiped clean the bed is perfect the staff is professional only one thing that left me disappointed the room 222 is looks directly and close to the central aircondition compressor engine and no noise isolation in the window so every 5 minutes the huge compressor starts and you feel in the room like in the diesel engine deck of a big merchant ship any way if you are enough tired maybe is not a problem but for me it was to noisy this room is simple not fit the general apparence and service level of the hotel maybe they sould be convert it for some other use store for example,3.0
palatial as the name suggests incredible location views service and excellent value,i stayed in the hotel with three friends on a holidayshopping trip to new york friendly helpful staff idyllic views of st patricks catheral very spacious bedrooms palatial foyer it is located one block from fifth avenue which makes it ideal for shopping siteseeing and theatre times square is within walking distance for us we appeared to get an excellent deal  it was incredible value for money however ithe breakfast appeared overpriced so we ate in a deli two doors from the main door of the hotel i would highly recommend this hotel,5.0
nice room sufficient bf and helpful crew,"as we entered the clerk welcomed us with a smile she verified our reservation quickly and we got to the room the elevator was a bit old but it did the job the room was not too modern and you could have seen that the furniture are not new but it was not shabby at all the room and bathroom were clean and tidy and they maintained it every day the breakfast consisted of your regular coffee muffins cereals and boiled eggs  it did the job
when we asked the clerk about places to visit  she willingly offered us a few alternatives and gave us precise directions
the location was central and close to a bus station our rooms window turned to the street so it was a bit noisy but we managed to sleep",3.0
10 second walk and bam youre on times square,this hotel was literally a 10 second walk and bam you are on times square we payed 300 a night in early november which was the best deal we found for such a great location there are two entrances to the hotel the main entrance on 44th street and the back entrance on 45th street which is handy depending on which end of nyc your coming from we stayed in a superior room which is just a standard room but bigger and on a higher floor the hotel seem a little out dated but had been renovated so it looked nice but it wasnt all nice and shiny new like a new hotel over all we plan to go back to nyc and stay here again it was such a good location and nice hotel,4.0
clean and met expectations,the rooms at the intercontinental are spacious and immaculate im a clean freak and it passed my standards with flying colors we stayed there after a few days at the cape and welcomed the metropolitan feel of the hotel the bathrooms are lovely and the sheets are soft the room was cleaned quickly each day the bar and restaurants outside are delightful to spend time in the bellman and the doormen are warm and welcoming but the rest i the staff needs some warmth training they are almost stoic it seems to be much more o a business hotel but was close to quincy market and the aquarium which served our needs fine the gym is top notch for a hotely only complaint was it was a bit sterile and cold if thats my only complaint they are doing a good job,4.0
great suites and personalized service,i stayed here for my brothers funeral it was a tough time because i had lost my son three weeks before the staff was so accomodating will and ray were so nice and the staff behind the desk were very kind the free full breakfast was good dinner at the courtyard was too coffee tea and hot chocolate were served all day all around my experience was terrific,5.0
a great downtown bargain,"this hotel was clean moderately priced with modern amenities and a larger that usual room for a downtown hotel the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was delicious with a variety of hot and cold items the free wifi was wonderful and also a rarity in downtown hotels it seems the hotel is a convenient walk to all downtown attractions and a short bus or subway ride to the historical district or the the university district in west philadelphia buy transportation tokens at a discount a block and a half away on market street it was also a short few blocks walk to the train station for the ride out to the airport
nearby 13th street was a wonderful location for restaurant and happy hour hopping",4.0
nice location but tiny room and bathroom,just off 5th ave i liked location very much however the bathroom was very tiny if you are solo thats fine but 2 people no place to put your bags the staff were very nice though,3.0
it was a super 8 and it still feels like one,it recently changed ownership and went from super 8 to ramada its a blight on the ramada chain what made me the most upset is that the picture they show makes it look like a nice hotel from the front they have the word hotel really big on top what they dont show is that the majority of the rooms are motel style and not hotel we were in the way back in a building on a slope second floor with no elevator and many steps no offer to help with luggage no offer to help with anything really it looked like they slapped a coat of paint on it and maybe bought new very hard beds the blanket inadequate was stained the windows dont have screens so i wasnt comfortable opening it to air out the room the ice machine as listed on their ammenities flyer was not to be found at all in my group of buildings and you had to walk down a sloping parking lot to the main building the fitness room had 5 machines and the bike didnt work they advertise a shuttle service but never mentioned one and when i asked they said to get downtown was by taxi or local bus theres a nice espresso barcafe across the street but when i asked about any local restaurants they said the only thing is their own restaurant yet their website lists over a dozen restaurants it was very misleading and since i didnt have a car i was stuck there after returning from my business downtown my advise is to stay away unless you want to stay at a newly painted super 8 motel,1.0
fall asleep to jack hammers and construction and pay a premium for it,the location of the hotel is great for being in viewing distance of the world trade center construction site unfortunately that closeness also includes listing to the tnt explosions and jack hammering of site preparation the hotel provided no advance warning that the superior room with view meant a view of a construction site and listening from 600 am to 1030 pm to construction sounds once we arrived to checkin we were provided with notice unfortunately a bit late to make better reservations we were accommodated with one room change reluctantly the self service kiosks were also not working for checkin and at checkout had to use two of them,1.0
brand new hotel,"i had a great stay at this hotel since the hotel has been open only a month everything was spotless in the room which was a little small but they managed to get a lot in the room the king bed was very comfortable and there were two bedside tables hdtv and a chair and ottoman the bathroom was a good size and spotless the free wireless worked well
i was on the seventh floor directly above the entrance and could see the upper portion of the empire state building above the building across the street 31st street is not very exciting but in just a block or two you are at herald square and another block or so at penn station i ate every morning in the restaurant and enjoyed the breakfast choices
i definitely will consider staying here on my next trip it is super convenient if you fly into jfk as you can take the train to penn station and then easy walk to the hotel",5.0
recently stayed at the colonnade i must,recently stayed at the colonnade i must say i was extremely impressed with the staff and overall appearance of the hotel it is obvious that the employees put their customer first and they take every opportunity to ensure your stay is the best it can be first ratethe rooms look like they have been recently renovated i would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to family and friends,5.0
clean and cheap  very hard bed,very friendly helpful staff i had reserved the room online so we had a quick check in the motel was full so we had the choice of a second floor room or a wheelchair accessible room on the first floor we choose the first floor room it was a smoking room and we are not smokers the smoke smell was not so bad that we could not stay in the room and it was very clean however being that this motel gets a lot of visitors the double mattresses seemed flat they were very hard and my husband and i did not sleep well we woke up stiff and achy,3.0
fine hotel in a fine location but no breakfast,"this convention style hotel is located in the back bay it is conveniently located two blocks from the tgreen line prudential station making for quick trip in and back to logan airport for only  2 each way and avoiding the rush hour traffic that would have made trip twice as long the room was newly redecorated with a comfortable bed and the 15th floor offered a nice view of the bay
check in was quick and that is not always the case when conventioneers show all at once
the location is a couple blocks from boylston and newbury streets with plenty of top notch restaurants and shops really a great neighborhood there is a large shopping mall that you can get to without going outside
the one thing that i could not understand was why there was no breakfast restaurant everybody had to leave the hotel for breakfast or go with the coffee pastry yogurt etc from the kiosk type food services
i would recommend this hotel for the convention trade if i were on my own i would consider the lennox on boylston st",4.0
great hotel at a great price,first time at thewit traveled with a group of 3 couples from hartfordefficient check in friendly staff clean and quiet rooms everything is new and fresh great breakfast and best of all a very reasonable price for a big city hotel would recommend it highly,4.0
old and tired,"booked two junior suites for family weekend at famed parker house hotel 
arrived to find no doorman or bellmen in sight
both suites were on the 2nd floor both overlooking a building under construction approximately 5 feet from the windows hotel entrances are surrounded by scaffolding for repairs no mention of construction on the website
in my search for electric outlets found significant layers of dust behind furniture hallways are poorly lighted walls are in major need of paint job and carpet is filthy
high speed internet is very slow
these junior suites each had 19 televisions  smallest that i have seen at any hotel in at least 15 years
took a trolley tour of boston and saw any number of hotels far superior in location quality and price
this oncefamous hotel has seen better days",1.0
a great holiday inn,"for what it is this holiday inn certainly gets the job done great location walking distance to pretty much everything in town helps that philly is an extremely walkable city 
the rooms are large and clean bathroom is a little small but it sure isnt a dealbreaker the staff were helpful and friendly the free wifi was a great deal
parking is 21 a day which might seem outrageous at first but for the in and out privilege and looking at the prices around nearby hotels it really isnt so bad
a well run hotel all around",4.0
wasnt that crazy about the neighborhood but it was okay,"we stayed here for one night since we were flying out of sd intl airport at 630 am the fact that it seemed to be convenient to a bunch of stuff down in this area of town might be of importance to you it wasnt to us lots of stuff in walking distance though  right like anybody walks in socal
thought it was pretty wack that they had signs up all over the place crowing about the fact that they change the bed linens for every guest really has it gotten commonplace that all hotels dont do that pretty creepy if you ask me
this place was a pretty good place to stay only had one gripe  if you need an airport shuttle make sure their schedule is going to work for you as close as they are to the airport having one ride per hour may be convenient for them but if you have a 630 am flight it gives you a choice of going at 430 am or 530 am cool just what i wanted get to sit at the airport that extra half hour at 5 am
the room was good pretty large and adequately equipped really liked the hot otis spunkmeyer cookies at the front desk mmmmm the neighborhood looked a little dicey but on the other hand if youre wanting to spend some quality time at the world famous body shop stripclub its real convenient for that just saying",4.0
served its purpose for half the nightsmoke smell woke us up for the other half,this seemed to be an average hotel upon arriving we went swimming and then to bed at 430 we woke up to a horrible smokeburning smell needless to say we didnt sleep the rest of the night because we were worried that wed all burn up we called the front desk around 500 and they said it must just be the oven however the hallway and downstairs didnt smell at all so im not sure how it could be the oven when youre on a roadtrip you need a good nights sleep i would have enjoyed sleeping the entire night,3.0
we have stayed here several times and every time it is a wonderful experience,great clean affordable place in a perfect location,5.0
excellence has a new meaning  boston harbor hotel,"i recently booked a small group at the boston harbor hotel i will admit that this particular group although small in size is extremely high maintenance and are generally a challenge to every hotel there were many changes and special requests prior to arrival that required me to speak with hotel employees from several departments my prearrival conversations and email correspondence were attended to timely and professionally but also with a refreshingly sincere friendliness 
upon arrival i was prepared for some of the numerous requests to have fallen through the cracks but every single thing i had arranged was in place additionally the staff in the various departments followed up with me personally during my stay to ensure their particular departments were responsive to our needs and even suggested things i had not yet considered talk about anticipating your guests needs
 the hotel itself is lovely and located in an excellent location the amenities are well above average and the restaurant alone is worth a flight to boston however it was the warm reception each of my attendees received coupled with the consistent high level of service from every single employee we encountered that will have book only at this hotel in boston really an amazing experience",5.0
best service ever at a hotel,we only stayed for one night but it was wonderful i had to call the hotel a few times before we arrived and every time anyone who answered was so accomodating robin and jorge who work the front desk are wonderful they went above and beyond to do whatever it took to make our stay fabulous the next morning we needed to check out but werent flying out until late that night they helped us plan our entire day and even let us keep our bags behind the front desk while we went sightseeing when we returned they had called a car to take us to the airport i plan to return to san fran and will never stay anywhere else,5.0
just handy for work but generally poor hotel,"i have stayed at the hilton post oak three times so far its handy for walking to the office and is chosen by the company i work for so i cant be fussy but the place itself lacks character rooms need refurbishment they are not very clean carpets are worn out and stink
air con blows cold air on your head as the beds are just close to the vent so you end up turning it off and sweat during the night
staff at reception are rude and snobbish however the waiting on staff are brilliant and the buffet breakfast is very good",2.0
budget hotel at a good location slightly overpriced,"we stayed for one night at this hotel we chose this based on its location  the cheapest available in the area 
location excellent five minutes to the downtown shopping district about 15 minutes from pikes place market however there is a gentlemens club at the back side of the hotel and the area may not be that safe to walk around late at night
amenities exercise room is minimal but equipment is functional no cleaning agent for wiping down the machines after use though
room old but adequate the bath tub is really narrow and small problems with dialing outside calls complimentary internet access but the wire wire only no wifi is very very short and is awkwardly located in between two beds i couldnt put my laptop on a desk and had to kneel down to work with my lap top very inconvenient
like location
dislike across from gentlemens club feeling a bit unsafe to talk around at night",3.0
ive always been a skeptic but,the hampton downtown is a great place to stay not only for the value but the service is excellent we are always skeptical when we read reviews and so that is why i decided that i needed to provide input on this hotel because we had a very positive experience first of all the hotel is a price value considering it is within walking distance to the cruise ships restaurants the ocean etc etc the rooms are very nice and well maintained the staff is excellent their shuttle service is very accommodating and the breakfast buffet is yummie not only did the staff go out of their way for us during our stay but they allowed us to store our luggage on our return from the cruise week our flight didnt leave san diego until 6pm we got off the cruise ship around 930 am and the hotel picked us up stored our luggage while we toured san diego for the day and then drove us to the airport we were very impressed and will definitely stay there again when we return to san diego ps yes the train does come through the area but it really isnt as bad as some have reported in the reviews we were on vacation and a little noise from a train wasnt going to bother us the positive to this is that you can go all over san diego from the train shuttle,5.0
first class service,"seven girlfriends and i stayed at the aloft on our way to a cruise we were catching in jacksonville
there was an airport shuttle and it was so fast and efficient
the hotel was modern and very cool
walkable to restaurants and last minute itmes
being near the airport it is used a lot but very clean
quiet and even has a pool
i bookeds the room on priceline and got a great deal
i cannot say enough about the desk staff they were so friendly and accomodating",5.0
great location for a 7 night stay highly recommended,"we originally chose the empire hotel based on its proximity to central park since we were on our honeymoon for a week we didnt want to be in the busy centre of manhattan the whole time on our arrival we were helped with our bags by the bellman straight away and miriam made our checkin quick and easy at the front desk she was a credit to the hotel giving us plenty of friendly advice on local sights throughout our stay we found all of the staff to be nothing short of friendly professional and courteous
our room a deluxe king was exceptionally clean and wellmaintained with a great view on the 8th floor it was away from the noise of the lobby and the rooftop bar and the sound of the street we had 7 nights of great sleep even with the window open we didnt know what to expect of the room before we came having read many reviews that the rooms were small but ours was a great size for the two of us if you want a bigger room you cant expect to pay for a standard queen and get a large suite
the empire hotel is in the perfect location for exploring central park visiting the lincoln center and getting into downtown manhattan its only a twenty minute walk from times square in fact when theres a whole foods at columbus circle a fiveminute walk you cant beat the location for convenience
wifi in the lobby area is complementary and if your flight isnt until later in the day on your day of checking out theres a free luggage storage room this was great for us as our flight wasnt until 7pm that evening
wed definitely come back if we chose to visit new york again",5.0
overpriced and over rated,stayed here for 2 nights and that was too long they didnt accept our travelex card for payment whereas every other hotel had been happy to accept it we have two children so we wanted to drop our luggage off and then head off to universal studios we didnt get back to our room until about 9pm when our son tried to go for a shower we found we couldnt adjust the temperature as the handle was broken we called reception expecting that someone would come fairly quickly but we had to phone again over half an hour later by which time wed had to shower our kids with cold water as they just couldnt stay awake any longer also the shower was so smallwe could barely turn around it didnt seem clean and the shower nozzle was so low we couldnt wash our hair the next morning we asked them to fix the shower and i told them wed had to put up with cold showers but got absolutely no recognition that this mattered when running a so called up market establishment we would expect prompt service a warm shower that was usable and to feel that every customer was important after travelling from australia we were tired and not having a clean usable shower was extremely disappointing especially considering the high price of our room would never recommend this hotel or stay there again,2.0
consistently a great experience,we typically stay here the night before an early morning flight out of the airport and normally using out marriott rewards points the staff could not be more accommodating and welcoming we have stayed at jw marriotts and ritz carltons and have not gotten the same service rooms are beautiful and always very clean the bar is a great place to unwind and the concierge lounge has a most adequate breakfast to get us started cudos to the management of this hotel as it is always a welcoming respite for us,5.0
very nice hotel but not perfect,"most stuff about this hotel was fantastic i liked the rooms the bed the shower and amenities the breakfast and i think the bar was good too though expensive if i remember 
we only experienced two problems first when we arrived to check in we were asked if we could wait until 7 pm as they had a large group to check in in return they offered us breakfast coupons for each day we stayed there when we returned to check in that evening the person checking us in knew nothing about it so we had to argue for a bit and wait until that person could contact the person who had checked us in my wife was more annoyed than i as she would not have agreed to check in later without getting a substantial return for it being tired from the trip it did get sorted out later and we received what they had promised 
the pool was also closed while we stayed though they had made arrangements with another hotel for us to use their pool 
without those two experiences which i assume most travellers wouldnt have i would definitely give this a full 55",4.0
one of the best so far,"my wife and i have just returned from a five night stay at the crowne plaza manhattan starting on the 26th of may 2008 and i have to say we were very impressed by this hotel although the hotel is currently under renovation our stay was by no means interrupted by the work being carried out we have stayed in some of the big named hotels in new york and this was by far one of the best we arrived at the hotel at 230 in the afternoon and had to wait approx 30 mins for our room to be made up as the check in time is 300 pm when you enter the lobby you need to take the lift to the first floor as this is were the reception area isthe rooms were extremely spaciousvery clean and also had air conditioning fresh towels were provided and the room was cleaned each day of our stay for location it dont get much better than this the view from our room was amazing looking out on to times square and also on to the hudson river all the broadway theatres nice restaurants shops and the ny information centre are within walking distance of this hotel the only thing i would fault the hotel on is their wifi acess in the rooms firstly for the daily cost of 20 and also the signal strenght was very poor it was like trying to connect using dail up  very slow  but this was only a minor issue i would highly recommmend this hotel to anyone looking for good hotel in central manhattan thank you crowne plaza for a very pleasant stay i have posted some pics of our room for everyone to see

if it werent for my business meetings i would have never had a reason to leave the hotel,my colleagues and i had some work to do down in san diego over the weekend but also wanted to stay somewhere where we could enjoy the nightlife after our work was done the hard rock had it all after our work was done we enjoyed ourselves at the pool bar in some unseasonably warm weather after a few drinks at the pool we headed back to our suite with a balcony overlooking the main street and rested up a bit while enjoying our ipod music through the rooms speaker system the shower and bathroom were separated which made it easy for me and my colleagues to get ready quicker than usual although we decided to eat somewhere else many restaurants walking distance from the hotel the hotel has a nobu sushi restaurant downstairs as well as a late night diner for those after hour cravings after a quick bite we headed to the hard rocks multilevel club and enjoyed some of the amazing san diego nightlife that we had heard so much about aside from the cutting edge design features and amazing amenities the hard rock san diego has to offer the staff was as friendly as can be from the concierge all the way up to the gm craig martin i will definitely stay here again next time im in town and urge anyone that wants to experience all that the san diego gaslamp quarter has to offer to stay here as well,5.0
great hotel  great experience,i stayed here for one night for a getaway weekend with my husband and another couple the hotel is in a grand historic building the decor was funky and beautiful the room was quiet the king deluxe room was large the bed was very comfortable the place was very clean and well maintained they had a nice wine reception at night what more can you ask for if i had a complaint it would be that kimpton for some reason likes to use sliding barnstyle doors for their bathroom i dont get this it isnt very private fortunately the bathroom was in a little hall way in the room so it wasnt so bad in this case i was very satisfied and would definitely stay here again,5.0
top notch hotel in every way,we also mentioned it was our anniversary 30th for us and received the same goodies  very nice touch the room on the harbor side 14th floor  was incredible our experience with spa services was also exceptional the hotels location is great for sightseeing and shopping at quincy market,5.0
great for business,stayed at the hotel monaco this past week while in chicago for a conference my room was large the bed was comfortable the water pressure in the shower was good one nice thing is the shower head is set high no need to duck your head to get wet here not much in the way of views from my 8th floor room but the window was large and let in enough light the hotel is near the el and is right between the loop and n michigan easy to walk to either,5.0
perfect for 6 year olds up to 16,"just returned from 5 nights with my wife and 2 daughters 7 and 10 what a perfect place for the family we are a very active family and this was perfect for us tennis golf and hiking close by 
excercise in the am and hit the pool about 11am lunch at the pool for the kids is 5 for a cheeseburger chicken tenders or quesadilla  great deal my wife and i like to have some beers during the day and we brought our own cooler to the pool each day great happy hour from 46 every night with half price drinks and sushi in main lobby area  did that daily complimentary laundry was nice 
we used points for our stay room rate was 400 a night great place to use points with the kids not a place to use points without the kids i would not pay 400 of my own money to stay instead find a condo unit to rent across the street at marriott canyon villas that gives you full priviledges at the hotel pools probably get one for 15003000 for a week depending on time of year
the blue sage is a satisfactory place to eat breakfast lunch dinner i would pay the 25 resort fee per day gives you access to tennis golf driving range and free meals for the kids at sage each day per each full paid entree 
roys on site is overrated 
i have stayed at many marriotts all over the us and abroad this is probably one of the nicest",5.0
not really downtown,"this hotel is in excellent shape the renovations are finished and the final product is nice and comfortable we found the room spacious and everything was clean the breakfast was good and the employees friendly even with a 6 am maintenance call because i couldnt get the hairdryer to work which turned out to be operator error
the only bad thing about this hotel is the location granted its actually affordable so i would stay again but the downtown part is misguided it is a quick walk to the monorail which will take you downtown but it is not in downtown seattle",4.0
spacious room ideal location,excellent hotel spacious rooms very clean great view if you choose upper floor workout facility was bright clean with good equipment and pool was perfect for early morning indoor swim staff was professional pleasant and sincere in wanting to ensure a comfortable stay location is ideal for walking to back bay boston commons or newbury street would definitely choose to stay at westin copley place again,5.0
comfortable inviting and responsive,while the room was starting to show its age with a dulling carpet and wellused shower head the room was spacious clean and quiet and the housekeeping staff quickly replaced the dead batteries in my tv remote and the burned out lightbulb in the bathroom i was pleased to see energyefficient cfl bulbs in all the lamps and the bed was the exceptionally comfortable when i inquired as to complimentary upgrades i gladly accepted a poolview room the selection of available restaurants onpremises was convenient but betterpriced options are available for those willing to make a short walk,4.0

sfo hilton finance,stayed here many times over the years on business great location next to china town with many shops and restaurants hotel restaurant is a good choice for breakfast and for a cheaper selection the mom and pop restaurant next door for breakfast ans lunch,4.0
not worth the money,we consider ourselves to be openminded hip young parents so we thought it would be fun to try this place with our kids ages 5 and 8 we live in the bay area and have stayed at other boutique hotels in san francisco but liked the area where this hotel is located and the appeal of the art we were sadly sadly disappointedfirst at the reception when we arrived the front desk doesnt have a welcoming attitude at all we were barely acknowledged and were told that we wouldnt know which room we would have until 300 pm we booked this 2 days prior with a staff member when we got the room key and saw that the room was right there in the lobby area facing the street we asked for another room i asked if there were other rooms for us to choose from the flat answer was no all the rooms are booked but that wasnt trueas we later heard at 100 am when a passerby was able to book a room on the spotthe room was located on the 2nd floorvery noisy noisy noisyfacing the street listening to any and all conversations outside the hotel as well as in the lobby the room itself looks outdated putting ikeaish furniture doesnt make it clean or cool for the same price try a joie de vivre boutique hotelbetter service better attitude better rooms better breakfast,1.0
new years eve disaster,i took my boyfriend to the hyatt regency as a christmas gift i wanted to spend two nights including new years eve at a luxurious hotel knowing how gorgeous hyatts can be  particularly the grand hyatt in dc where i had wanted to stay  i assumed this one would be just as beautiful we were in for an unpleasant surprise the outside of the building makes it look like a cheap motel the facade is grungy and dismal though the lobby was nice enough and the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable there were more problems the cleaning people did not replace our towels the second day and they did not provide us with new bottles of water the worst part of our stay came on new years eve  just past midnight due to a computer glitch all guests of the hotel were locked out of their rooms chaos broke out with the 500 asian professionals group who were anything but professional when they could not get into their rooms the rowdy guests were drunk and fighting smoking in the elevators and running like crazy people all over the hotel they set a fire alarm off at 130 am the hyatt staff did not have an appropriate way of dealing with the glitch there was just one person who could unlock the rooms so it took hours before every guest could get to bed it was an absolute circus though not the hyatts fault the computer glitch the way that they handled the crisis was terrible we were also annoyed that they hadnt told us that a rowdy group of hundreds of 2025yearolds would be staying in the hotel i would not stay at this particular hyatt ever again bad memories,2.0

my new favourite san francisco hotel,"i had the pleasure of staying at the st regis for 4 nights while attending a convention at the adjacent moscone center the san francisco museum of modern art is next door union square market st and the ferry buildingfarmers market are within walking distance the hotel deserves high praise for its location design style technology amenities and especially its service 
the st regis and luxury collection are the starwood groups high end chains having stayed 3 times at the wonderful st regis new york and having visited the st regis monarch beach ca and washington dc i was looking forward to my stay here and at a convention group rate to boot
the hotel is about 2 years old and located on the corner of mission and 3rd directly on the corner the facade of a historic 8 story building was preserved and a high rise tower was integrated behind beside and above it on what once was a parking lot the hotel occupies the first 20 floors of the tower the top 20 or so floors are st regis residences within the older building are the hotels 2 restaurantsame dinner on the first floor and vitrine breakfast and lunch on the 4thas well as the 2 level spa and offices there is a landscaped terrace on the roof and another larger terrace on the 4th floor which was tented for an outdoor dinner party when i was there the lobby in the newer building is compact but stylish and welldesigned a design feature of rose petals is echoed throughout the public areas
our convention rate was for the superior room category on the lower floors 58 so i was pleasantly surprised when i was upgraded to a deluxe roomsame size but on a higher floor 15 i also was able to check in early my room looked similar to the photos posted on 1106 by a tripadvisor member from sunnyvale ca my room faced west with a view of yerba buena gardens moscone and points beyond the east facing rooms face the bay but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the financial district
the room itself was not too large but contemporary and sleek the entry foyer had a table wooden floor sculpture and leather walls there was another wood wall hanging in the bedroom the bedside table held the st regis signature phonecomputer that can control the thermostat lights window shades alarm clock etc via a touch screen there were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair but no chaise lounge or fainting chair as seen on the hotel web site there was a large marble window ledgegreat for counter space one wall held the 42 flat screen tv which did not swivel and 3 recessed doorsone was a too small closet only about 2 feet of space another held a safe fax machine out of ink and 3 drawers the third held the minibar and fridge and dvdcd player the spacious bath had an enclosed wc a tub that opened onto the bedroom a separate shower stall with marble bench rain head plus handheld head there was a 2nd flat screen tv but only one sink in the room and bath there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels
technological glitches included 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired batteries with the phonecomputer the party i was speaking to occasionally could not hear me though i could hear them the hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when i requested a wakeup call and the operator called twice but could not hear me so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door alas the phone still was acting up on check out day 
overall service was top notchquick courteous and professionalespecially the front desk and housekeeping the problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies the doormen were not so attentiveoften talking with the valets no one helped me when i walked up with my luggage when first checking in some of the concierge staff while helpful were a bit aloof i believe all the st regis offer butler service in new york this is quite formal but seems less so here one butler i spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessionalwhen she couldnt answer my question she yelledasked another employee without putting me on hold so i could hear every thing
the public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool also open 24 hours the whirlpool steam room and sauna are within the spaall are on the small side the business center consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators this may be a temporary location
regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviewsyes you can hear them but i imagine the other nearby hotelsw four seasons westin marriottcan as well
i have stayed at a few other highend hotels herethe ritz carlton campton place the palace i would like to one day try the four seasons and the mandarin oriental but for now the st regis is my favourite san francisco hotel",5.0
really good position,the location is excellent for exploring the city in a few minutes you can get to fishermans wharf or ghirardelli square the hotel is also very close to two terminals of cable cars the hotel is not bad the staff is nice there is a large car park for a fee room is quite and clean even though the view of the inner courtyard is not exactly the best the room price is quite high though in line with san francisco prices the wifi is free of charge while breakfast is extra all in all our stay was positive,3.0
just blown off,we arrived on dec 27th and left december 31 and were booked in room 12225 we could not view the pay per view movie and i called the front desk to asked them to fix it we were charged for the movie and spent the rest of our visit with a television that did not work properly i was informed by the operator that 50 of all televisions were inoperative i also complained that the exaust fan in the bath room did not work this caused a lot of steam as well as the room heating up the vanity faucet leaked and there was quite a bit of mold behind it the toilet ran constantly and many times i had to remove the lid to secure the flapper valve the room was not cleaned properly every day because twice our ice bucket was left without a new bag and water in the bottom of it in addition the window lock was broken and the batteries in the safe needed to be changed because once i could not get into it the front desk did send someone up thenbut they never changed them that was the only time the front desk sent anyone for what we paid we should have gotten better service and a better room,2.0
what happened here,"spent 5 nights at the lenox the location is superb refurbishments to the rooms were evident beds were ok linens were very good air conditioning controls left alot to be desired in 92 degree weather

ramada inn better than expected,"we recently mid april stayed 4 nights at ramada inn and were pleasantly surprised bearing in mind some previous reviews seems to be having a facelift and is looking good so far  our room was freshly painted and the bathroom was new we had a fridge and microwave too  handy for purchases made at the farmers market close to the metro with several people offering assistance with ticketing and directions although we did use taxis at night caught train to universal studios and upgraded to a list front of line ticket so no waiting in queues  still cheaper than taking a tour and meant we saw everything la was hot during the day and cold at night so be prepared 
the staff very friendly and helpful we would definitely stay there again as excellent value also there is a good budget chinese restaurant across the road",4.0
good hotel in a good location,"this hotel is convienently located from the transportation centre we arrived there from the airport and was pleased to find the hotel so near we also used the bus service from here to the stockyards which was ideal for us
we did not realise the historical nature of the hotel until we arrived it is very close to the convention centre and our room overlooked this 
the room itself was a standard hilton room nothing extraordinary but functional this was great for us as we spent most of our time out and about in fort worth there is also a starbucks within the hotel if needed the staff were friendly and helpful greeting us with a cheery hello each time we passed that was a nice touch which is not always found within this hotel chain
we did not partake in the breakfast at the hotel but there are other places nearby where you can get a variety of breakfast options
all in all we enjoyed our stay and the hotel served our purposes of having somewhere to lay our heads whilst sightseeing a functional hotel room with air conditioning clean room and clean bathroom",4.0
great location and price,wonderful central location to times square and the theater district clean and tidy,4.0
not as bad as the other reviews lead me to believe,"we live in the columbus ohio area and wanted to take our kids 6 and 3 for a short staycation the kids always love kalahari but we didnt want to drive the 25 hours each wayand part of the lure of kalahari is the outdoor activities as well so we decided to go to fort rapids however after reading all the reviews i was more than hesitant 
generally speaking the hotel and waterpark are just fineas long as you arent expecting something upscale the hotel room was a bit dated and does need repairs if not careful the water in the bathroom came out scalding hot but that could be managedbetter than no hot water the bathroom had some tiles that were cracked and falling out and the tv was circa 1999 however the room was comfortable and our family of four slept just fine i read a few people talk about bed bugsand then i read a 5star hotel in nyc also had them
as for the waterpark let me put it in simple terms if kalahari is the major league of waterparks than fort rapids is a solid aa farm team our kids had a great time and were never bored for them they saw no difference bt kalahari and fort rapidsat least from a waterpark perspective the two arent even comparable when it comes to food quality food choices arcade and indoor play areawhich fort rapids doesnt even have 
i would say that if you have older kids 10  14 fort rapids is probably still fun for a few hours or one nightas long as their expectations are set i definately would not make a weekend out of it a onenight stay is probably perfect if your kids are older than 15 then stay away they will hate it after 20 minutes there just arent that many rides for kids in that age group how many times can you go down the same water slide
another tip is to arrive on thursday instead of friday we got there at 4pm on thursday and shared the waterpark with 50 other people total on friday morning i would say the numbers swelled to around 100 stillno wait for any ride it was like the park was all to ourselves but about 6 or 7pm it got packed not helped by the 300 kids that got off what seemed like 10 buses 
finally a quick word about the staff there are plenty of life guards and they are on at all times i watched them carefully and they never stopped walking and they were diligent about keeping their eyes on the water they have been well trained as for the rest of the staff they were pleasant but you could easily tell that they werent a professional staff i know working sucks but at least they could try to be happy
one last thingabsolutely no problems with the high speed wireless internet work great",3.0
we had a great experience,"this hotel has lake union right across the street the staff is friendly and always willing to help jim  front desk was always kindtheres always a bowl with delicious apples at the reception and also different teas  coffee the pool is not big but is indoors and in seattle this is a great thing theres also a hot tub
our room was spotless very spacious it had 2 queen beds and a sofa bed desk chair big lcd tv and 2 vanities one outside the shower area and another inside more than enough room for a family of 4
ac worked well breakfast area was ample with a terrace area so you can have breakfast overlooking the lake breakfast was good my daughter loved the blueberry waffles breakfast staff was always attentive and kind 
the hotel provides and excellent shuttle service to downtown one of the drivers dont remember his name was super attentive the hotel but specially the people who work there made our stay unforgettable thank you
tip if you happen to be in seattle on a sunday and want to go for a free ride on a wooden boat go to the center for wooden boats you can walk there at 1000am and sign up on one of the waiting lists they have for different boats every sunday they give free rides beginning  300pm but you have to sign up early my family and i had a great time there",5.0
they lost my top,"the hotel was very good and clean nice viewwhich you pay
but after the cleaning lady came to remake the bedi could not find any more my new top which i had left on the bedit was very disappoining as when i went and ask the reception they did not help at halli could choose to not doing anything or make an official reporttoo much for a topbut for the price you pay they could at least give you a free drink when something like that happens",3.0
great place to stay in baltimore for the inner harbor,this hotel is a good place to stay for the location near the inner harbor of baltimore at a reasonable price my husband and i stayed in a suite that had free wireless internet refrigerator coffee maker and hair dryer the continental breakfast was delicious and filling the hotel staff were pleasant very helpful and polite across the street from the hotel is the charm city circulator  free public transportation throughout the city this is very convenient overall this is a good place to stay,4.0
good weather great hotel,my girlfriend and i traveled to phoenix this past week to search for an apartment we move in september and wanted to get a good idea of places we are moving from columbus its spring break and the weather there was perfect so we came down for a businessleisure visit the hotel was amazing beautiful architecture great location in the mountains ample pools and hot tubs excellent service and the room was large and comfortable the only negative i could find is that there were lots of teenagers and adolescents  the only problem was that they were all in the main pool area but thankfully there is a pool inside our hotels courtyard this was a great place to come home to after active phoenician days and i will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and family that come visit,5.0
grand and comfortable,"cant beat the midtown location on 54th between 5th and 6th aves and its 
its a grand old hotel in very nice condition without the madness that is known as the hilton across the street the rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable but do not expect to have any view from your window other than a brick wall valet parking is available the weekend rate in early june was 265 to 300 but adding another 30 to have breakfast for 2 included is the right decision the buffet breakfast was more than adequate with eggs bacon sausage smoked salmon fruit cheese etc even though there is no omlette station and no pancakes that certainly beats going out for breakfast someplace else where you will certainly spend at least 15 per person i would choose this a place again",4.0
old and run down,i booked this hotel for 2 nights on businessthere was no fridge or microwave it would have cost an addition 50 a nightthe water in the tub could not be shut offeverything was in bad shape the bed was the only thing that made the stay bearableit was comfortablewould not recommend,2.0
wow even better once you have actually experienced it,i would like to just say our checkin was done in an efficient and professional manner by mei and her professionalism didnt stop there we had few problems but she was able to help solve them before it was even noticed had a couple other glitches with service but overall it was on point you have to know to apprecite places as the waldorf in order to really enjoy your experience there it was centrally located to mostly everything time square rockerfeller center subway and shopping on saks fifth also i have to give a huge thank you to ms ana who works in groups dept and made the whole trip worthwhile,4.0
nothing to worry about staying at this hotel,"i had read mixed reviews before i stayed at hie fishermans wharf and was a little worried the check in staff were all very helpful the lobby was welcoming and you had free internet and printing access 
the room was a little smaller than i had expected but was clean and in good condition there was no view out of the window but the hotel location was good close to the pier and the cable car turnaround 
the free breakfast was a bonus having read a few reviews i did not expect fine dining we went early as our body clocks had not really adjusted from uk time 8hours and never had a problems finding a table 
overall the hotel was fine it did everything we needed it too i have not stayed in any other hotels in san francisco so i can not compare it in terms of value for money",3.0
best location and value,"very friendly staff the thing that impressed me the most was the value and location of this hotel the hotel is located directly on michigan ave magnificent mile and it is within walking distance to navy pier lake michigan bus stops there is a corner bakery right around the corner where there is excellent breakfast the water tower mall is also close by approx 5min walking
the rooms were clean everything was working and what you get for what you pay is an excellent value",5.0

great location good value at right price,"i stay in manhattan a couple times a year on business and leisure travel all the affinia hotels are good to great this one is quite good a priceline bid got a standard sized room by manhattan standards small for 115 before taxes it was clean and comfortable the hotel was a couple blocks walk from the megabus stop and right next to penn station 
there are lots of places to eat right nearby i suggest cafe r to the east on 31st for good reasonably priced eats of all sorts",4.0
great hotel if a bit noisy,"room was tiny  but wed got a really cheap rate so were expecting a box  but was stylish and clean and bathroom was good although had a glass panel to the bedroom so could be embarassing if you werent travelling with your partner
location was excellent for the east village and les  loads of bars and restaurants nearby plus subway on the corner only problem is that it is right on a busy road with lots of late night revellers so it was noisy at night despite the double glazing so not a good choice if youre a light sleeper like me
staff were fantastic friendly and efficient and gave us vouchers for free drinks and the cute japanese bar next door 
one of the best things about the hotel is the roof terrace which gives great views of midtown and downtown over the roofs
breakfast was ok  usual buffet stuff on disposable plates but plenty of it free wifi and internet downstairs is a definate bonus
overall defintely worth a stay although no way would i pay the rack rates on the hotels website  make sure you get a good deal on a discount site",4.0
great location,location is excellent rooms are a little small  so are the bathrooms concierge is very helpful,4.0
not for those allergic to animal dander,this hotel has so much going for it a great location beautiful historic details and excellent service but in attempting to be totally pet friendly it fails to be completely human friendly i am very allergic to animal dander allergy pills dont completely control my symptoms and they have side effects that make for an unpleasant experience most hotels that allow pets have some designated petfree rooms especially big hotels that host conferences i expected this but the park plaza doesnt animal dander isnt removed by regular vacuuming and laundering of sheets and pillow cases it requires steam cleaning of carpets and furniture washing the walls and it cannot be completely removed from mattresses and pillows this is why its meaningless to tell guests that their room has been carefully cleaned i was told that if i had a bad reaction to the room i could be moved and try another room but unfortunately since bad allergy reactions can take a day or two to manifest and days to clear up thats not a good solution not only did i start to have bad symptoms by the end of the second day i found the lack of an upholstered chair in the room increasingly uncomfortable i had to avoid the bed as much as possible as it made me wheeze and the hard chair with a plastic seat necessary to cut down on pet damage i guess made working in my room hard i had to avoid common areas as they were overrun with dogs if i hadnt been at the hotel for a conference i would have checked out and found another place to stay as it is i will ask the organization never to use this as their conference hotel again and im sad about that as it is a beautiful place im not sure why pets have to come before people here hotels stopped letting smokers have the run of the place years ago the current pet friendly policies are a big step backwards the millions of people who have severe animal dander allergies arent trying to be difficult we are just trying to breathe freely how about designating some rooms for pets and some petfree,2.0
be careful about hard rock,i was scheduled to stay at the hard rock in june but had to cancel i had booked the hotel back in january when i called six days before my arrival date to cancel i was told that i would be charged for my stay because i did not cancel seven days in advance i told the customer service rep that i had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that i was told back in january i honestly dont remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel i for one will never stay at a hard rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice,1.0
fishermans wharf stay,the hyatt was a very comfortable place to stay very good service and the restaurant was pretty good too good beds pillows linens climate control we stayed there during the 2012 us open golf tournament very convenient for public transportation lots of restaurants and shopping close by only criticism is that the wifi should be free would stay again,4.0
the is a fullbilling hotel,"even before you step in the hotel they will ask for more money than you have already committed to from the pricey valet parking and high drink charges to the upcharges for basic utilities like access to the internet they are committed to pulling as much money from you as they possibly can irrespective of the amount of service you use
whats odd is that the lobby is all but useless since they play music i find obnoxious and the seating is sparse and uninviting if you are going to spend the money do like all the us presidents do and go across the street to the fairmont and at least get a nice atmosphere",3.0
great party location and great staff parking weak,"i would recommend this hotel if you have activities downtown

we visited austin to see family and a night out the location was great walking distance to food and fun the staff was very helpful and friendly rooms were ok and i was able to get a room on the 23 floor good view looking east i did later find out they offered a free breakfast but only after we had already check out wish that had been relayed at check in no big deal beware of the parking the valet service told me their area was full and i need to self park in the area below the hotel after driving around the 5 floor garage found this full as well i located a spot on the street and on my walk back to the hotel noticed the valet parking still cars guess mercedes trumps dodge trucks well the street parking was free on the weekend",4.0
superb hotel in a fabulous location,"we booked this hotel via ebookers and it was nothing short of excellent the staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were spacious and had all facilities that you would expect plus much more

cool hotel with nice rooms and great location,i am a starwood member and there were few good choices in boston the night i stayed here i paid close to 400 a night which is more than i usually would spend the hotel is very nice it has a very interesting history as a converted prison from the late 1800s it is a bit trendy and hip which i enjoyed the lobby is especially cool i did not try either restaurant but they both looked good they are lots of local neighbor hood places to eat and drink to just a short walk to beacon hill the rooms are nice see the pictures attached i stayed in room 1103 with a great charles river view and city view get a odd number room on a high floor,5.0
great hotel,perfect location and great beds great service i would stay there anytime again,5.0
an oasis of comfort and service in times square,located at the edge of the theatre district on 42nd st between 7th and 8th avenues this hotel provides a convenient oasis of serenity and comfort as well as a great location for getting all around nyc by subway the front desk staff is the best ive ever experienced especially guest service agents coretta elcock and gwen raquel ortiz,5.0
clean spacious value for money and great staff,"ofcourse i was worried after reading all the reviews on here but i still took my chances and booked this hotel i can rate this hotel best among my entire stay in the states to give a clue it was better than stratosphere in vegas the best part was the polite staff especially marvin all of them were really cooperative and helpful i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone travelling to san francisco 
and yeah dont miss the small shabby mexican eatery on market st i think its called taqueria on the corner of 6 st and market st you will certainly bless me for this tip",5.0
great hotel great location very friendly staff,my wife and i got a good deal on a suite at the magnolia so we figured wed try it out the location is in the heart of downtown dallas very close to everything downtown and close to the major highways in dallas the room was large and spacious the bed was comfortable and the room service was actually good kobe burger i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in dallas,5.0
clean comfortable and convenient,my family traveled to baltimore to drop our son off at johns hopkins for the second half of the summer this hotel was a terrific place to stay not only is it located right across from the stadium at hopkins but the rooms are very comfortable the internet is free and the beds are really cozy my only complaint would be that the bathrooms are small but we didnt spend much time there so it didnt matter much to us parking is extra so be prepared for that we got a great deal that included breakfast and the breakfast was very nice the staff are helpful and pleasant oh when you check in you get a yummy warm chocolate cookie,5.0
excellent in every way,stayed here 3 weeks ago with my mother in a double room the rooms were big beds super comfortable staff fabulous location great near 2 subway stations close to 5th avenue it was wonderful to retreat here after a huge day in nyc would not hesitate in staying here again or recommending to friends the kitchenette was great as we could have our own breakfast in the room if we wanted too we never had to wait more than a minute or two for the lifts lovely ambience and the restaurant downstairs has fantastic food,5.0
location location and shuttle service ,"this hotel is located in the middle of great shopping even beyond the galleria next door four ladies on a girls trip never had to venture further than a few blocks the entire weekend for great food and retail therapy 
malle the shuttle service driver was courteous and very helpful driving us back and forth to dinners the other staff was pleasant as well
the hotel itself is updated in some places like flat screen tvs carpeting in rooms and vanity area but less in other places like the showers 
overall a good value when booked through third party provider",4.0
one of the best,had a great experience at the inn at the market very very clean extremely comfortable bed and bedding great location was able to walk to public transportation superb restaurants within walking distance used the free business center every night for email staff was super friendly and helpful loved all of the lights and outlets in the room,5.0
dont expect anything more than a good nights sleep,lobby good and clean valet nice not knowledgeable front desk personle not informative on anything didnt know where things were could not give information on where to get transportation interacted with 3 different front desk employees and they all were a bit snippy all that was tolerable but the onsite restaurant dine i will not recommend at all the staff was rude the food quality is overpriced some staff didnt speak english or even understand it there was not a blow dryer in the room and it took 3 calls to get on and then they acted like we stole it and looked around our room before giving us a dryer would not stay here again for 16000 a night,3.0
great place,been staying at this hotel since 2006 and they have always done me right the hotel is in a great location next to nasa clearlake of course keamah shopping great food and the beach not toention the hotel price is right compared to lesser valued hotels in galveston this place is always our first choice when were wanting a quick get away,5.0
thanks cadillac,we found cadillac very comfortable and the staff were efficient and accommodating great bathrooms nice lobby a short walk into town and right near the beach its worth checking out the venice beach skate park those kids have got talent,5.0
id say excellent if theyd not charged me twice in the end,"i liked the hotel very much it creates the sense of luxuriance large nicely decorated bedroom separate kitchen room everything is clean but wellmaintained though not brandnew centrally located in washington street bicycles rental next street if anybody is interested 
i was charged twice ive got 2 alert messages immediately and told the same to the lady at front desk she assured me only one is charge another  hold ive left my bank phone numbers and she promised to release the hold however it was pure doubleprocessing now i have to spend my time for initiating chargeback  better pay cash in this hotel",4.0

this is the friendliest place i have ever stayed,over the years i have stayed at the alexander inn around 40 times while traveling on business while not luxurious the rooms are clean quite comfortable and charming what keeps me coming back is the friendliness of the staff from john the innkeeper to the housekeepers and desk clerks the staff is very friendly and helpful the inn is conveniently located and just a couple of blocks from the arts district there are wonderful resteraunts within a block or two the alexander inn is by far the best lodging value in the city i will be back again and again,4.0
could be better,"good location 
nice property that has seen better times 
carpets needs replacement or at least some intensive cleaning hallway carpets were filthy 
elliptical machine at the gym is old and noisy 
service is correct but slow nothing special 
needs improvement to keep up with hilton standards",4.0
clean hotel  reasonable rates great location,my family of four including two teenage boys stayed here for five nights in august the location just off m street was very convenient to the shops and restaurants in georgetown as well as the metro station about 1 mile away the hotel rooms were very large and reasonably priced the free continental breakfast included cold cereals pastries breads fresh fruit juice and coffee the hotel and surrounding area was very clean and we are picky about the hotels we stay in we felt safe walking around town and back and forth to the metro station at night even the few homeless people that we saw were very friendly and respectful i would definitely stay here again,5.0
loved the space,we stayed at the buckingham 1 nov  4 nov 2008 excellent suite room loads of space kitchenette area lounge area with sofa bed so easy can accommodate 4 people great location 57st off 6 ave only 2 blocks away from central park in the heart of everythingwould book again,5.0
good value and location,i like the fact that the hotel is directly 3 blocks down from great shopping in union square the hotel room was very large clean and comfortable its a older hotel with loads of character the continental breakfast and evening reception was a really nice touch the staff was very professional and personable,3.0
great place to stay when visiting chicago with family andor friends,"i went to chicago with a group of friends for the weekend this hotel was centrally located  short walk to millenium park the river architectural tour a walking food tour and a block from the l which we took to a white sox game the rooms were suprisingly spacious for a big city and very clean we opted for a river view room and there was little to no street noise the staff were friendly and professional  the concierge easily got us tickets to second city the same night while i didnt use it the workout facilities were clean and had a fridge packed with cold bottled waters
the hotel also has some nice touches such as starbucks coffee each morning in the lobby as well as a wine and sangria hour with lite hors doeuvres
all in all id highly recommend this hotel especially if you are visiting chicago with friends andor family for the weekend",5.0
whats wrong with this place,"not a lot really 
i stayed for a single night its well positioned in chicago north of the river a few blocks from the miracle mile the front desk is prepared for your arrival and efficient i got a good sized corner room on the 5th floor well appointed for business good bathroom good sleep even thought there was some traffic noise sable restaurant provides a good variety of food 
the next day we ran a meeting for 25 in room designed to use natural light the room was good and activity nicely supported departure was smooth",5.0
comfortable stay,while not in the city center this hotel is conveniently located by a major route so it is very easy to get anywhere the room is clean and comfortable while the signs of the hotel indicate room cleaning on the weekend is available upon request only we found our rooms cleaned without asking on a saturday the complimentary breakfast offers some good options the only down side is that there seems to be only one elevator in the hotel and it is slow oh and the pool is more of a splash pool than a swimming pool so it was a little disappointing because we ere going to try to swim,4.0
a very pleasant stay,"my family and i 4 adults stayed at the monticello inn for 4 nights we booked a nonsmoking room with 2 king beds online throught the monticellokimpton website with no problem 
 the location was great right in union square it was within easy walking distance of shopping and cable cars although we had a car we could have easily used public transportation anywhere since it seems that most lines cross through union sq
 the room was very nice despite the buildings age the hotel is well kept and clean with comfortable beds and pillows i was relieved that the room did not in fact smell of smoke at all being a nonsmoking room i expected that but id been rudely surprised before the bathrooms are small but how big does a bathroom need to be they had dispensers instead of bottles supposedly to avoid the waste caused by amenity packaging for hand soap lotion shampoo conditioner and shower gel my only real complaint about the bathroom is the shower head was not very good
 since we did had a car we opted for the parking package which included valet parking in the price of the stay although we did have some trouble due to some miscommunication between the front desk and the parking garage it was convinient to not have to look for parking every night the downside to this is if you leave something in your car you need to have them bring the car back up from the garage in order to get it
 the staff were all very friendly and always offered directions when we took the car out unfortunately the continental breakfast was 6 per person but the staff gave us very good recommendations for nearby breakfast places
 overall it was a pleasant stay and since we could walk to so many places we felt that we got a much better idea of what the city is actually like rather than just hitting the tourist hot spots",4.0
some aspects were very good some just average,"we stayed for 3 nights this month with access to the club level 
pros
club level is awesome excellent assortment of food and beverage each day beautifully decorated for xmas and great service
nice spacious rooms considering the size of a typicaly nyc hotel room this was great separate bath and shower king size bed desk area and ample closet space
housekeeping and valet were excellent 
cons
location while i did like being away from the fray at night its a good 1520 minute taxi ride to midtown which gets expensive and a tad annoying after a few days
reception concierge restaurant staff were ok not great ive had better and more genuine interactions at budget friendly hotels eg we had dinner at the restaurant waiter never checked back to our table to ask how dinner was or offer drink refills 
no gift shop be sure to pack all your toiletries or be stuck with tiny selection of goods stuck behind concierge desk or hope you make it to duane reade during regular business hours 
i would need to rethink staying here in the future for the  you pay there should be more onsite amenities better service and transport services offered by hotel to take guests to midtown

my family had a great stay,i along with my family enjoyed an extended stay at the hotel we thoroughly enjoyed the time spent at residence inn i was very impressed by the services provided by the hotel staff they were very friendly and always keen to help that made our stay very comfortable the canal view is fantastic and one can always take a walk by the canal highly recommended,5.0

great for the price,i was a little skeptical about this hotel after reading some of the reviews but my fiance and i decided to chance it we booked the astor for a long weekend mar 30apr 2 we are both extrememly fussy and were pleasantly surprised when we arrived lobby was a bit small but check in was a breeze people at the front desk on both night and day shifts are very nice be careful with the doorman hes a little pushy about bringing up your bags the elevator is a bit small only fitting about 4 average size people i was extrememly suprised once i opened the room door yes our room was small but it had a private bathroom and remember this is new york if you want big you gotta pay big everything including the bathroom was impeccably clean checked every single spot in the room before we decided it was perfect our room 1005 has a small balcony facing out to other buildings not the nicest view but ok for us the bed and sheets were comfortable and yes we were woken up at around 6 am on friday morning to the rattling radiator but it only lasted about 5 minutes and didnt happen again for the rest of our stay there is a subway station on either side of the hotel which is perfect for getting around it is a little far from all the attractions but with the subways so close we had no problem with that in the end we actually prefered it that way after standing in front of the hilton in time square  2 am check out was quick and they offered to make arrangements for a transport from the hotel to the airport at 18 pp which was not bad but we had already made other arrangements to be perfectly honest i thought it was a steal for 89 a night and would definitely stay there again,4.0
wonderful setup so why do they nickle and dime you,very nice location close to 5th street right beside petco park  baseball good rooms good fitness centre was there for a convention  good meetingconference rooms main peeve was that the wifi was 1520day the business centre was even more expensive the convention had to set up an internet cafe so that attendees did not get dinged but that was only for day use even in this day and age hotel 8 has free wifi everything was set at gouge prices a coke can in a machine was 450 parking was 25selfpark 30valet per day did not expect that from a class organization that caters to businessconvention crowd,3.0
best place in manhattan,"by all means check in to the chelsea pines inn after traveling to nyc for over thirty years i finally found the best kept secret
its on west 14th in the heart of the meat packing district the sky line and chelsea its walking distance to soho china town and little italy
the inn is spotless rooms are bigger than you would think for nyc
each room has a theme of stars from the past which makes it even more inviting 
every morning starting at 730 they offer a continental breakfast which is surpasses for sure fresh muffins home made breads bagels croissants peanut butter cream cheese butter assorted jellies coffee tea juices cereal yogurt fresh fruit even a splash of an english breakfast with ham cheeses olives beautifully displayed they have a closed in patio that when you are sitting there you forget you are in the city but instead in an english gardenthe staff is the bomb friendly and so helpful they will suggest restaurants shopping places comedy clubs you ask them you will get an answerand when you return from a day out in the big apple they all want to know what you did and how it went they are genuine people which makes chelsea pines a home away from home
oh yea and be sure to look for charlie the resident cat hes the best 
thank you chelsea pines for a great 15 day stay cant wait to see you next month
i was traveling alone so security was a big factor for me i felt so safe and welcomed there i felt like they took me under their wings",5.0
nice hotel but huge inconvenience,i booked a room through priceline for 90 per night  taxes and fees i was extremely happy with this price as i have stayed at this hotel before and remembered it to be very nice i was really happy with the quality of the hotel our room was clean spacious and very modern overall the staff is friendly and helpful the hotel is in a very central location a short distance to navy pier the magnificient mile and several rail system stops the el i would have rated this hotel very highly and been incredibly happy with our stay except for one huge inconvenience we checked in around midnight and were told that the hotel had been overbooked due to their contract with british airways and poor weather in europe resulting in the grounding of many european flightsi understand that this situation was out of the hotels control they offered to move us to another nearby hotel for the night and swissotel would take care of the cost for that night as much as i would have rather just stayed there and paid for all 3 nights i realized that there was nothing that could be done and this seemed like adequate compensation i was under the impression that i would be refunded the cost of one nights stay this was not the case when i inquired about the refund upon checkout the clerk informed me that the hotel had merely covered the cost of the other hotel i said that i did not feel that this was adequate compensation for having to move to another hotel after midnight then packing up and checking out of the other hotel less than 12 hours later i had already paid to stay at the swissotel so them paying for the other hotel did nothing for me she only said that she was sorry to hear that i emailed the hotel upon my return home but i have yet to receive a response from anyone at the swissotel chicago i would be extremely upset had i paid full price for this room overall this hotel is very nice and the staff is friendly and helpful however this situation was a very inconvenient start to our trip a simple response to my email would have been nice,3.0
great location,this hotel is located in a great area within walking distance to most of the great sites like the vietnam memorial and the lincoln memorialit is about 34 of a mile from these famous landmarks the hotel restaurant does not open until 7 am so if you have an early conference or workshop dont expect any coffee or breakfast there is a starbucks within walking distance and a few places to eat within a few blocks the rooms are not equipped with the usual amenities of big name hotels like coffee makers and ice machines but the restaurant will bring you ice if you need it the internet is free although i could not access it and chose to go to starbucks instead of sitting on the phone with tech support they have no business center and no place to print boarding passes but kinkos is around the corner this hotel was very roomy and quiet the only noise i heard was people walking around in the room above me this is not a good choice for handicapped people they have several steps into the hotel lobby and not much of a lobby to speak of with very very small elevators this is a boutique hotel and is representative of a european hotel the ambiance is very quaint they keep you supplied with bottled water for free,4.0
great location in midtown manhattan,this hilton garden inn does exactly what it says on the wrapper dont expect swimming pools and goldplated taps do expect great service and the most fantastic breakfast in the adjoining restaurant and clean rooms and if you are a hhonors member there are great benefits to staying here as well you can walk everywhere from here bar lower manhattan  and the subway is 50 yards away,5.0
great stay for a family of 5,just returned from a week at the salisbury had low expectations due to the age of the hotel it was a clean friendly hotel with huge we had a one bedroom suite rooms and so convenient to everything we wanted to do there is currently a big construction project going on across the street so if you get a street view room you will be awakened by the construction noise didnt eat the breakfast there but plenty of bagel shops and delis close by two blocks from central park close to times square and museums this hotel is not fancy no doorman but room size price and location more than made up for it will stay there again,4.0
reminded me of embassy suites,we stayed here for a discounted rate offered during movein week at ut we checked in late in the evening so we didnt get to use any of the restaurants or enjoy the outdoor patio which looked lovely the hotel is set up in a triangular fashion with the rooms along the perimeter overlooking the big central area so it has a very open feeling we had a standard king room it was very clean modern and quiet bed was comfortable and we had soft feather pillows bathroom had all the usual things including a hair dryer coffee pot provided in the room two robes provided we used the gym and it was clean with wellfunctioning equipment although it was limited as in most hotels the cardio equipment had personal builtin tvs and they supplied towels infused water headphones etc very nice setup valet available but we selfparked and it was another 12 the taxes were almost 40 for one night location is convenient to campus but certainly not walking distance if you were in town for a football game lots of interesting restaurants within one block entry access to the jogging paths around town lake were within one block of the hotel which is fun if you have never done it i would stay here again but i cant imagine paying the usual rate which the front desk said was over 240night with taxes i think it will be almost 300 its not that good,4.0
incredible customer service,people really do make the difference when traveling we had made reservations for 2 rooms but the couple we were overnighting with had a child emergency and had to cancel right before checking in the staff could not have been more concerned or gracious they could tell we were frazzled and were very accomodating the rooms are always nice but the real value here is the staff despite all of the options in town i wouldnt stay anywhere else,5.0
good murray hill experience,"i just finished 5 nights at murray hill east suites the location is fantastic it is super easy to get anywhere from grand central the gourmet market around the corner is super the lack of internet access was a real pain you can get a signal from kinkos next door in the lobby sometimes and pay with your credit card to surf but i ended up going to the apple store at 59th and 5th for free access the staff was hot and cold sometimes modestly helpful but often disinterested  standoffish 
the rooms are super big very firm beds i had to buy my own pillow at macys their pillows really bite esp now that premium hotels have such a nice selection and we are spoiled 
i think this was the loudest hotel i have used in nyc even at night there seemed to be constant noise out front in part because there is a steel plate covering a hole in the street that makes a racket every time someone drives over it but earplugs settled that problem
so every hotel has its ups and downs but i liked mhes overall and would stay again but only if it is mainly for the rate which was the case this time but it is sad when 250nt is a good rate im not sure how much longer i will be able to afford nyc",4.0

excellent very happy customer,i stayed in a view room with two double beds with my friend for westminster dog show the location was brilliant across the road to madison square garden down the road from port authority great for shopping tours ladies macys down the road you must go from here we walked to times square empire state building and much much more the subway is right next door and the tick tock diner is great value for breakfast or a late night snack staff were awesome  we felt right at home rooms were clean  very comfortable highly recommended,4.0
setting its own standard,i live in new york city when i want to take a mimi vacation i check myself into the standard the hotel is located in the heart of the meatpacking district and just steps away from all the major bars and restaurant rooms have great views services are great and people are friendly having great restaurant and lounges you will never leave the hotel the only negative i have about this hotel is the checkout time,5.0
a great hotel,stayed here for the second time on business having previously visited with my family i was delighted to find i once again had a huge room with a great view the front desk staff couldnt have been more helpful and room service was able to deliver me a sandwich at 10pm highly recommended,5.0
something was not quite right,"i stayed in this hotel while i attended a conference in seattle from november 14 2006 to november 18 2006 i thought i was saving my company money by staying here rather than one of the hotels closer to the washington state convention and trade center but in the end i spent the same amount of money it would have cost me to stay in a closer hotel
the biggest problem i had with this hotel is its location it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the convention center due to the construction and the traffic lights try doing this in the rain a few times and youll see how much of a problem it is going to the public market and other tourist sites will require an even further walk expect to be very tired at the end of the day especially if you are traveling here from the east coast like i was
be careful with the valet parking i woke up on the third day of the conference to drive my wife back to the airport when i went to pick up my car the valet came back and told me that my car had a flat tire i am rather suspicious about how that could have happened we did not run over anything during our drive from the rental car office to the hotel and there were no apparent problems with the tires when we picked up the car i have no way of proving if the valets caused the flat but i am peeved that no one noticed the flat until i had to go pick up the car just imagine if i had discovered this on the day i was supposed to leave seattle as it was i barely got any time to visit the space needle after waiting for roadside assistance to fix the flat i also had to shell out an additional 30 to get my wife to the airport via taxi
the breakfasts arent bad when you consider that they are included in the price of your room i would be more disappointed with them if i had to pay an additional fee for them the potatoes were usually lukewarm and the pancakes and french toast had that institutional taste they also premeasure waffle batter for the makeyourown waffle bar but many days the amount of batter they gave you was not enough to make a complete waffle
i also had an issue with the housekeeping i returned to my room at the end of the day only to find that the glasses in the bathroom had not been cleaned i know this because my wifes lipstick was still on one of the glasses it was things like these that gave me an uneasy feeling about this hotel
all in all i have to say that i was disappointed with this hotel it was not a bad experience but it wasnt up to the high quality i have come to expect from marriott hotels",2.0
good location,this hotel is nothing special the rooms are ok but not great if you want to stay in a famous hotel this would be a good one because it is not too expensive the best part about this hotel is the location we found difficult to ask for a 2 bed rooms and only got an extra bed instead when they brought the extra bed the person who brought the bed was not happy and you can tell which i thought was rude but may be normal for nyc i would not recommend to stay in this hotel only because you can find a cheaper one closer to the central park and probably as good as this one or better,3.0
fairly nice,"this place is a good value for the money especially for the dc area however i did encounter a minor problem i made my reservations several months in advance through the front desk a week before our trip i called to double check our reservation the front desk had the wrong dates feb instead of june i explained that i called in feb to make reservations for june when we arrived we were given a room that was adequate for our family of 7 however it wasnt the room that was described i feel that we were put in smaller accommodations for the price of the larger the front desk was willing to give us a discount but said it would take several weeks to go through accounting we settled for free parking and no charge for our rollaway which was less hassle but not as much of a discount as we could have received the kitchen was also not as well stocked as i expected i dont recall a pot or pan in the place since we were mainly using the microwave that wasnt a problem but just something to be aware of if youre planning on cooking to save money
pluses picturesque georgetown location near the dc cupcakes store and larger rooms for a much better price than other hotels 
minuses rooms are dated but clean halls smelled of smoke though the room did not be sure to double check your reservations",4.0
mediocre hotel fine for most stays,it was dated but clean average hotel ac only sorta worked staff was unprofessional and not very friendly so we went our way an they went theirs room was spacious but odd full size fridge and had only 1 outlet in the entire room so it was iron or have a cup of coffee and it was across the room so you couldnt use the iphone for alarm if you wanted it to charge at night which also means no laptop in bed nice bar and restaurant the most fantastic thing about this hotel was it was soooo quiet bachelorette parties fourth of july volleyball tourney with a million highschool kids but i didnt hear a thing so id stay here again,3.0
great place but a few tips,"my husband and i just returned from six nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary we asked for a quiet location and didnt care about a view and were given room 701 a junior suite that faces the side of the mcdonalds building next door it was well protected from neighboring room noise it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet and fairly protected from street noise but more about that in a minute the room was very large and clean the bed and chairs comfortable and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries the bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan as it has no vent or window and a couple of days when i attempted to shower around noon i had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water this didnt happen when showering earlier the kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters as we did not like the inroom pucks filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee the azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar including items such as stuffed tofu sesame noodles and seafood a hot foods bar and many essentials such as boxed cereal baked goods sandwiches and drinks so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner a table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both but we only had the desk
i had read some reviewers comments about rooms being too hot and they were right in fact the entire hotel is overheated and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40degree air at all times including at night fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units which created a nice white noise for sleeping unfortunately though the smell of mcdonalds often wafted in a fanonly setting on the heatingac unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy but the only option at this time of year was hot air because the hotel hadnt yet switched over to ac were lucky that we didnt arrive later in spring because i can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there also there were no screens on the windows so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open
i do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators stay on a lower floor and take the stairs we were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats
the second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed and has two computers with internet access for guests the trouble is theres no regulation of usage so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other likeminded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends her mother finally told her to get offbut then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email the other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to flickr apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs the staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area
overall we would stay there again but only during the cold season on the quiet side of the building or during the hot season when the ac is turned on",5.0
should have been great,well accor as a group normally provide excellent service and hotels the times square hotel is the exception from the moment we arrived till the moment we left the staff could not have done less to assist with anything from faulty items in the rooms to a very poor quality breakfast complete with cracked cups and plates the room was just ok at the price and location the door looked like it had seen better days and had been attempted to be kicked in a few times the location is great and if the staff gave slightly more than a damn about being there it could be just ok if they try otherwise they are obviously selling based on location and name shame accor shame,1.0
definately will stay here again,stayed in san diego for a few days before a cruise and got the best service from the staff and especially the shuttle service,5.0
great hotel great location,"excellent hotel in the heart of new york city easily accessible to all you can do and think of doing in this vibrant citythis hotel has some really good bars and the food is good toovery nice spa but mind you try and book treatments in advance as they are really busy
the rooms are very comfortable and have every convenience built in
the subway station is right there ans so is the bus stop so extremely convenientgreat restaurants all round the hotel as this is really a restaurant city with some great food
the managers at this hotel are really nice and i had to extend my stay due to an emergency but was immediately assisted by mr tim mcdonnell and everything was taken care of inspite of the fact that the hotel was really busy
the concierge service was excellent unlike many similar hotels in the area

what a wonderful boutique hotel would stay again for sure,"my best friend and i stayed at the hotel monaco in denver for a girls weekend for my birthday we had tickets to a show in boulder and decided to stay in denver becase there is more to do in denver we live in colorado so we were driving anyway
for some reason we had a hard time finding the hotel its kind of in a weird place set in the middle of other buildings not really set apart like most big hotels are we drove by it once its on a oneway street and it was pain to get back to there is no parking garage just valet only i guess the complaint i am making is that there is no big sign telling you where the hotel is the sign is small make sure to keep an eye out for it
hotel monaco in denver is in a great location within walking distance to the 16th street mall and the convention centeryou can pretty much see all of downtown 
denver by foot from the hotel monaco when the weather is nice
when we finally arrived we were very happy with what we found the hotel monaco is very stylish very cute very clean and the staff is wonderful they are extremely dogcat friendly and that was cool we didnt have a pet with us on this trip
we had a queenqueen room
our room was beautiful and clean the beds were comfortable and it was nice and quiet the only thing i didnt like was that the windows didnt open they do advertise soundproof windows they are sealed shut and if i remember correctly there are solid panes of glass over the windows that bothered me as i like to open my hotel room windows for fresh air
the restaurant panzano was delicious for dinner and for breakfast i highly recommend the eggs benedict we thoroughly enjoying our dining experience at panzano
we also had spa services including massage and pedicure at the renaissance aveda spa  salon located inside the hotel 
we walked to fado irish pub and sing sing it was quite a hike in dress shoes and it was cold but a nice walk nonetheless we ended up taking a biketaxi a human pedaled biketaki thing back to the hotel after an evening of drinking and that was fun
i highly recommend sing sing we had a blast there

great base hotel for sightseeing,"we got a great last minute deal on this hotel through expedia we went to seattle to watch a seahawks game and because its one of our favourite cities to visit the fairmont lived up to its title  its an elegant hotel in a great location the lobby is beautiful the food was good try the banana foster creme brulee at the lobby bar and breakfast cost 20 ea service was prompt and more than helpful there is a 24 hr concierge who can recommend restaurants and activities for every budget 
i had read reviews before booking and i concur that the rooms are small but they upgraded us for no charge the decor is very fussy and a little dated but the bathrooms and room amenities were adequate although the room lacked a coffe maker my only real complaint is that the towels were thin and not soft at all but 2 robes were provided which was a nice touch
there are three entrances to the hotel each on a different street which is very convenient 
it was only one block from the university street light rail station which brought us directly from seatac airport for 250 
from the hotel we walked to qwest field which was only 10 mins at a brisk pace pike place market the waterfront all shops and malls and took the monorail to the space needle 
this hotel makes a great base for exploring downtown seattle

hotel grand hyatt ny  strategic location direct passage to the grand central station and metro,the hotel is really close to times square chrysler building onu 5th avenue rockfeller center public library moreover there is a direct access from the hotel to the grand central station and metroreal good to move fastly and easily in new york if you dont want to walk  my and my friends rooms were big only the bathroom was small my room was always clean but my friends room 2 times in 5 days wasnt clean so the hotel to apologize for this gave them a credit to spend in the hotel restaurant and bar  all hotel services have to be paied and so without tell me anything during the check in when i received an enveloppe from an express forwarder to pay a small amount for this service they charged on my credit card an important amount to cover also potential future extra costs i discovered this only when i received on my mobile phone the information of this debit and i called my credit card assistence service to verify what was happened may be someone cloned my card after my complain the receptionist explained me that this was the hotel rule and they at the end of my stay will have recharged on my credit card the change to close this complain they give me a small credit to use at the hotel bar honestly speaking i think that this things have to be explained during the check in and not after a complain  anyway this is the turist life  i advice this hotel because it is nice and the location is really strategic,3.0

so welcoming i wouldnt trade this hotel for anything,my husband and i went to boston for a 2 night stay without out 3 children we booked our two nights at the lenox through travelzoo and were not disappointed upon arriving from the airport we checked in at the front desk check in was smooth and after telling the staff we had a rough flightthey asked us what we wanted to drink within minutes we were given a glass of wine and ice cold boston lager for my husband now that is great service the next day we were headed to a red sox game we stopped to ask the concierge about recommendations for dinner he gave us a few suggestions made reservations for us and then proceeded to give us 2 tickets for the red sox game when we arrived back in our room we discovered a bottle of wine on ice along with 2 wine glasses i am not sure if this is typical or we just lucked out but i wouldnt stay in another hotel in boston after this service,5.0
overnight stay at a great hotel,i spent friday night at this hotel while recently in boston like all other times i have visited this hyatt property the rooms service and staff were all excellent the staff was attentive and accommodating and made the check in and out process effortless the hotels location is easy to find and is superb if you are visiting anywhere in the city i highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to stay in a classic city property,5.0
basic but very acceptable,"staying one night in an extended stay hotel takes some getting used to as it is not unusual to find no shampoo in the bathroom but sometimes it is a good option as the rooms are typically larger and there will be a small kitchenette 
i had to make a quick trip to charlotte and then we realized it coincided with the presidents visit to the dnc this was one of the very few hotels in charlotte that did not double or triple their rates to fleece those attending the dnc and this is to be very highly commended the easy access to the ring road as well as a local supermarket makes this a very convenient hotel internet access was free but as a new twist there is a charge if you want a higher speed access the basic free access worked fine but i would not be surprised if the clever it folk dont start to slow it down until they get enough high speed paying customers 
parking was fine but you need to watch for the very small entrance sign on park road i drove right by it",3.0
time for new mattresses,"we checked in at 11pm the neighborhood was a little rough the bed was awful it was as if someone had thrown a foam mattress on top of the old mattress if you got too close to the edge youd roll off the bed 
we forgot our shampoo and there was no small bottle of shampoo like in all the other bws in which weve stayed we washed our hair with a very small bar of soap and barely had enough left for bathing the heavy curtains covered the air conditioning unit so we had to prop a chair under the curtains to hold them up so we could get cool air into the room when we checked out the next morning the two men at the desk barely spoke english so it was difficult to communicate with them we finally gave up and just left for the price it was fine but i would never stay there for more than one night we almost never stay in a aaa two diamond and this is the perfect example of why",2.0
good enough but could be great,"located on hotel circle this hotel is on the margin of getting a very good from me
the good things are that the rooms all open on secure interior hallways theres just one elevator and to get to it you have to pass the front desk all the other doors are locked and accessible only with a room key
next theres free internet free parking and decent rooms with a kitchenette no big frills but nice to have there is an ironing board hair dryer etc convenient plugs for you electronics and all the necessities you might need
spacious windows that open plenty of lighting nicesized bath very reasonably priced even on walkup with no reservation
now to get the very good id love to give this place it needs just a few things the trash cans need to be emptied more often on the exterior and the elevator could use a good wipedown blankets should be inspected for holes and carpet replaced when worn
thats it otherwise its a nice place
keep in mind that i had a smoking room  i dont smoke but thats all they had it smelled amazingly fresh so i took it but there were burns in the carpet and around the bathroom sink if i were this hotel id ban the smokers to the outside like most places do to each his own though
the area is hotel circle i find the area inexpensive but otherwise unattractive its right on the freeway as are all the hotels in the area 
on the other hand its just down the hill from hillcrest near the fashion valley mall and just minutes from downtown and the airport
i liked this place because it didnt pretend to be something its not",3.0
what a letdown,"i dont understand why this hotel gets such good reviews here i reserved a bayview room and even paid extra for this experience what i got was a view of the train yard and the big hilton in front of the bay this hotel is really too far away to have a bayview even on the 12th floor you really didnt see much but hilton convention center train yard and a thin strip of ocean water out on the horizon the rooms were a good size but were noisy from the trolleys running most of the nightplus the bed was so uncomfortable and the pillows put a kink in my wifes neck
the bar closed down early at 1030 when we arrived and the hotel was dead i know they cant change their location but a bar closed at 1030 they should not mislead people on their website into thinking that this place has nice bayviews as it doesnt
the good reviews here must be for a different hotel than what i stayed atas i was not impressed and checked out early",2.0
convenient for business and pleasure,"we stayed in the hotel for 7 nights and found it to be a most convenient location to get to business meetings the convention centre as well as interesting spots for dinner and tourism
the rooms are quite spacious and in good condition 
i found the service excellent  the main guy at the front desk is hilarious but helpful also in the restaurant and bar they are great the conceirge can be a little annoying especially one of them who on arrival kept asking us about our departure so he could book a car for us to the airport  i kept telling him that i dont want to think about my departure when i just arrived after a 25 hour flight but he wouldnt listen too pushy
breakfast was excellent considering this was a garden inn better than some more expensive hotels

hampton inn manhattanseaportfinancial district,good hotel situated with a subway station within walking distance the only complaint is that the rooms have paper thin walls and doors did not bother us too much but might be seen as a negative breakfast was included in our room and exceeded our expectations since this is a hampton inn catering more towards business travelers who might only be interested in a quick bite there are a few bars in the nearby seaport village for a quick dinner or a few beers,4.0
would stay here again,let me start by saying that i would stay here again the room was very clean we were not bothered by noise from the surrounding area we use ear plugs a problem i had was that they say there is free wifi but we found it spotty at best i was all over denver and as i write this i am in a restaurant so i know how to get on different connections so i dont know what the problem was the staff was very helpful in trying to figure out the problem i would just say that if you have work to do and need to get on the internet you may want to reconsider,3.0

great experience  hilton san antonio,"this was my second stay on the hilton san antonio hill country hotel  spa the first time i was here it was for business in the winter the hotel was running at a much slower pace and i had great outstanding service my family and i came back for a summer holiday and you knew that everyone was on holiday i did have to wait to check in but this was after having to wait to go through customs wait for my delayed plane and wait for my luggage welcome to vacationing with everyone else 
our room was a suite overlooking the pool it was beautiful clean and spacious  we were very pleased the hotel is in the perfect location for sea world and offers complimentary shuttle service to and from the park yes we had to wait in a line but we also waited in line to get into the park and for the majority of rides we wanted to go on we had our breakfasts at the hotel and on our sea world day it was very busy as we wanted to eat early and get to the park we had days where we slept in and were able to miss the rush and had a relaxing enjoyable breakfast
the outdoor movie and smores are a nice treat and one i highly recommend
while the hotel was bursting at the seams with people on summer holidays i can say that we had a great time our room was clean and spacious and the staff went out of their way to make this a wonderful family holiday  will make this our holiday hotel for san antonio",5.0
nice hotel close to everything,my wife and i did a weekend in philly with our parents to see the king tut exhibit which was only ok and check out the local historical attractions the hotel decor is art deco and in my opinion very classy the entire place was clean and well maintained the rooms were great especially a handicappedaccess room my inlaws needed although the beds were too high for a wheelchair bound person to comfortably get on service was good checkin was a breeze the parking was expensive but you cant avoid that in downtown philly we had a 27th floor room and the view was awesome of the skyline only downside was the rooms doors do not go all the way to the floor and a lot of hall noise pours through the 2 gap some woman decided to have a cell phone conversation outside our door at midnight and i not only heard everything she said i could hear the guy on the cell phone with her besides the rough sleep it was a good overall stay and the deal they had running for the tut special couldnt have been better this is a hotel we would consider returning to in the future,4.0
nice taste of japantown,this hotel in japantown felt like an oasis of calm in a busy part of sf it could use a little updating in the rooms and common areas carpet etc but overall a very nice hotel its close to yoshis on fillmore which is why we chose it staff was very courteous and helpful room had some japanese touches and amenities  it definitely felt different than an average hotel room our street level room facing the street was somewhat disappointing  thought i had requested a better view room but not a big deal they probably would have changed our room if we had asked in all honesty overall as frequent sf visitors but not to this part of town we felt comfortable and safe in an unfamiliar area,3.0
100day incidental fee they dont tell you about,typically hotels hold a credit card in case charges are made parc 55 charges you 100  day on your card in advance before you even make any charges i am staying 10 days and was supposed to be charged 1000 but for some reason they decided to only charge me 100 i have yet to see if ill be getting this money back worse nowhere on the website can i find information regarding this incidental charge several people at the front desk i spoke to said they had no idea if the information was on the website or not ive traveled numerous times for both business and pleasure and this is the first time ive had this happen to me or heard of it happening stay tuned folks,2.0
it was ok location was what made it,i usually find that negative reviews of places are overly critical and i usually end up being pleasantly surprised once i get to a place buti will say in this case the reviews are pretty accurate i knew a nyc hotel would likely have small rooms and this place definitely did along with a bathroom the size of closet but on top of that the room walls are so thin just as many reviews saidwe literally could hear word for word convservations that our neighbors would have and it woke me up early each morning in addition the rooms really do need a serious update1980s for sure the front desk staff were not very friendlyacted as if we were a bother to them because they were always so busy and maybe because we were priceline customers which i dont think should matter should still be treated with equal respect we had requested a room with two beds but there was not one ready when we checked in so the clerk said he would send a rollaway bed up right away well guess what we get back from an entire days excursions at 1100pm at night and no rollaway bed and what made my review jump from average to poor is that i just checked my credit card statement and there is a charge from the hotel that i did not authorize even though we were priceline you still have to give your credit card for incidentals when you check in well we charged nothing at all to our room we were only in the hotel long enough to sleep and get ready each day and when we checked out there were no charges but now there is charge for something i called the customer service and of course i dont get connected to a real person but had to leave a msg and wait for someone to call me back within 24 hrs so well see how that goes but the the only staff that were friendly were the bell captains so that we appreciate and the room was pretty clean not spotless though always hate when i find other peoples hair in the bathroom and the location could not have been betterreally right in the heart of the theater district and times square we never had time to even make it to the pool or fitness center so cant comment on that overall if you get a really good deal on this place then it might be worth booking only for the location otherwise it is just very average to poor with nothing memorable other than the location if they would do some updating and make you feel more important there then i would probably think differently but well see because i am really interested to see how they will handle this mysterious charge and why the heck it is on my credit card grrr,2.0
overall a good stay and easy to drive too,"i stayed the night in manhattan for the first time and found that this hotel was very easy to find cant miss the large red colored hampton inn sign on the side of the building as you drive up 8th ave this was also the first time i drove into nyc and found that the parking at the hotel was very easy to get into and out of
i arrived at the hotel several hours before checkin and the staff was very accommodating by rushing to get my room ready so i didnt have to wait around in the lobby with my bags i did end up having a bit of a mix up when i first was given a room the first room that i was assigned was occupied when i opened the door needless to say it was a bit of a shock to walk in on a couple of people so i went downstairs to get a new room and the staff was very apologetic about the mix up after that everything was fine my room was clean and realitively quiet for being in the heart of nyc although you could hear the neighboring rooms slamming doors all night
overall it was a nice enough hotel friendly staff great location one block from time square easy parking only 30 a day which isnt bad for nyc alright breakfast i say alright because i had the oatmeal and that wasnt so goodso just dont get the oatmeal everything else was fine youll have a nice time at this hotel

worn out  uncomfortable needs a lot of work,this hotel was a huge disappointment for the 3 nights we booked a jr suite it was supposed to be our luxury end to a californian trip it it not a luxury hotel this hotel needs to seriously renovate and have some customer service training pros location the garden dome is lovely id just walk in to look at it the food prices however in the hotel are reminiscent of 80s expensive accounts the dome over the pool was nice we were on the 4th floor by the pool and i was concerned about noise from the corridors but that was fine lovely high ceilings cons bed was horrible doubles seem more like super twin sized unless your married dont consider sharing even still we put our daughter on the bedroom chair with ottoman wedged so we could each have a bed the beds were very uncomfortable and old the sofa bed was worse if the beds were comfortable and the room quieter then we might not have had such a bad experienceid still think i paid too much but at least we would have slept rundown outdated uncomfortable distressed  and i dont mean fashionably wooden furniture was scarred  upholstery was stained sheets were worn and there was even holes in our coverlet windows let all city noise in every morning there was beep beeping from trucks our toilet was plugged so my dh went to the front desk to let them know it was about 9am and after an hour waiting we then called the front desk and while she was apologetic it still took another 20 minutes when i called housekeeping they were really rude yet the maid in the room was nice we do tip daily the bathroom grout was dirty looking id not take a bath in there when i let the front desk know we had checked out i wanted to let them know that i was disappointed i wasnt asked how everything was so i didnt have the opportunity it took 40 minutes for the valet 48 day to find our van we had a minibar in our room a can of pop for 5 i can expect 3 but that is crazy i did take pictures and will load them later i do not mind spending money if there is value in it id never stay here again unless they do some serious renovations especially with the beds even the elevator buttons were in horrible condition i dont mind the brass stuff but its all scratched and just unpleasant,2.0
typical hotel in favoured tourist area,holiday inn fishermans wharf was ok i certainly had no complaints extra bed for son was not great but room was large enough for two nights breakfast cart in morning was very reasonable and staff were very friendly and helpful location was very good if you have never been to san francisco we only hired our car the day we were checking out as parking fees are ridiculous but public transport in san francisco couldnt be easier and is very reasonable and handy for hotel including tram stop,3.0
wonderful hotel in the heart of sf,"this hotel deserves the reviews it gets the rooms are clean and comfortable the staff are friendly and helpful the doorman that we passed twice a day or more was a real highlight he was friendly helpful and welcoming he always put a smile on our faces

they have dvds to lend and there are lots of tv channels so its easy to find something to watch after a long day they also have fruit out at night if you desire a healthy snack

our king room on the 8th floor was very lovelycomfortable bed good shower and water pressurenice touch was the lighted makeup mirror tons of natural light as well as ample lamps as well as tons of plugs for different things to plug in
be prepared to pay 15 for underground parkingyou have unlimited access in and out for that price
one change  on the website it states unlimited free local phone calls in their guest directory that they leave in the room it states 50per local calli called downstairs and they were unsure i called the diamond desk and they said they spoke to a manager and the policy has changed and there really is a 50per local call hopefully the website will be corrected to reflect the change
being a diamond member we were offered complimentary breakfast  erics really pretty restaurant insidei ordered a cheese omelette with a bagel  very tasty and my husband had the french toast and he enjoyed that a lot too coffee tasted sorta burned tasting so drank mostly water",4.0
lovely service exceptional service and a fun place to stay,"the hotel was lovely and quite stylish rooms were clean and represented well as shown on site what we really enjoyed were all the extra efforts shared with us its always fun feeling like a guest instead of another body to fill a room the concierge maryanne or maryellen was super helpful and really listened to our wants  needs in recommendations of restaurants  must sees with our frequent requests i could tell her recommendations were not just the standard responses as we are not wanting the typical tourist spotswe wanted to really experience boston thanks to her housekeeping etc we had a great time overall in boston who said boston is unfriendly 
we didnt visit the bars or restaurantjust a little too much hipnesscool factor for our style",5.0
an awesome stay  will definitely return to the library hotel,"my boyfriend and i are just returning from a 3 day stay at the library hotel and have just loved our experience the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful from getting us a cab during busy hours hotel staff actually spent 10 minutes on the street trying to get us the cab to making restaurant reservations for us at the awesome benjamin steakhouse across the street for very last minute
the morning breakfast was great lots of variety and constantly replenished so you dont feel like youre eating leftovers if go for later breakfast great coffee is served all day as well as fresh pastries and fruit the complementary wine and cheese is also great with a nice selection of food and wine i recommend the wine and cheese on 2nd fllor as opposed to getting a drink on the 14th floor terrace
our room was very clean and comfortable although some could argue that the rooms are small they are no smaller than any hotel room you would get in europe and has everything you need for a very confortable stay hotel noise is also very limited as there are not many rooms per floor
also we drove in to the city and got a discount to a parking lot around the corner due to our stay at the hotel and this was the cheapest weve ever paid for parking in new york
we will definitely be back at the library hotel for our next stay in new york city",5.0
beautiful hotel unbelievable price when bidding as trendy as it gets,"this hotel is modern trendy and packed full of people i was wearing designer jeans and a collar shirt and felt out of place while registering for my room
room were small but clean and trendy bathroom was large would definitly recomend this hotel again the best bid i ever one for qualityvalue
there is underground parking 1 block away for about 30 if you park at the hotel it is about 15 more wireless internet was free as well although i did have some difficulties connecting with my tablet",5.0
hotel carlton  full of character and charm,"i picked hotel carlton for my first trip to san francisco after reading positive reviews on tripadvisor and also as it was one of the few hotels that was able to meet my required dates as always i feel a good hotel should have a comfortable bed good shower high level of cleanliness and a good location free wifi is a welcome bonus
im pleased to report that hotel carlton does fulfill this criteria and also gets brownie points for the walkin closet and the excellent front of house staff who were unfailingly polite sincere and friendly in helping book excursions and shuttles to giving directionssuggestions for places to eat furthermore i was pleasantly surprised that both daynight staff were equally lovely and proactive  it is always a shame when part of one team are more helpful than the other but this was not the case here
however ive given hotel carlton 4stars because of noise levels which did disrupt my stay as my room was opposite the lift i expected some level of constant noise but was not prepared for the building work across the street which prematurely ended a much needed liein i also felt the hotel should have ipod docks rather cd alarm clocks as this would have helped drown out some of the noise but hopefully not end up as a source of noise pollution itself 
i did raise these points with front desk who clarified that the noise was an ongoing issue that the hotel were taking strident measures to address and that they were ordering ipod docks for rooms in the near future which was a satisfactory response
i would recommend this hotel for anyone sick of those modern identikit chain hotels or someone looking for a hotel with plenty of spirit  high maintenance types would do better to go elsewhere it is a 10 minute walk to union square and there are plenty of places to eat nearby as well which makes it a good base for exploring the city and i would stay here again if given the chance",4.0
how nice can it be,we stayed for 5 nights of nyc sight seeing and were not disappointed we had a great travelzoo rate and were upgraded from a jr suite to a 1 bedroom suite with king bed the rooms were very large bathroom average with shower but more than adequate very quiet with lots of windows and 2 flat screen tvs the location only a few blocks from grand central station was very convenient unless youre adverse to walking a little bit we took the express bus from jfk which drops you off at grand central but picked us up at the hotel on the way back for 24 rt each we found walking the best way to really see the city but also used the subways a lot to go further distances theres a really convenient grocery store dagostinos and wine store just a block away and the nice pantry came in handy for storing fruit  juice for a quick snack in the morning and winebeer for the late evening after being out all day we had one dinner at rare and the food was well prepared service was efficient and price was about what one would expect in that locale the breakfast prices were a bit high so we ate at the deli down the street and a really nice restaurant under the bridge near grand central station dukes around the corner was also good for an inexpensive dinner veselkas was recommended for an authentic ukrainian meal and it didnt disappoint in the east village and lots of local color specialites were blintzes goulash beef strogonoff etc the housekeeping and front desk staff were very pleasant and efficient and we would stay there again in a hearbeat,5.0
great place to stay for conventions and mccormack centre,i have stayed here 3 years in a row when i am in town for the c2e2 comic convention clean and large room breakfast cafeteria downstairs is not cheap but has character and good food easy walking distance to the mccormack centre and across the street from a bus that will take you downtown free parking too,4.0
why all the negative comments,i am repeatedly amazed at the negative comments ive read on this site because my experience is always a positive one the roosevelt is a case in point my wife and i had a wonderful time staying here for 6 nights an unbelievably low price 103night a room with 2 queen beds and adequate space for an old nyc hotel everything worked well in the room great mattress and linens and tons of pillows maid service was good everyone in the hotel was friendly and helpful the location cant be beat midtown east within walking distance to theaters times square ny public library pierpoint morgan library times square empire state building rockefeller center etc etc no surprizes at checkout we paid exactly what we were quoted when booking thru a discount website we recommend this hotel highly,5.0
very impressed with this hotel,"ok after reading some of the reviews on here i was getting a bit apprehensive about what we would find at park 79 dog pee smells anyway so i was preparing myself to not be too impressed how wrong i was
the doorman on duty were always friendly and polite and helpful as were the staff at the desk there was a sort of youngish guy who was really chatty and bubbly our room was on the 5th floor what a nice room it was just everything i needed a big comfy bed and a tv oh and a mirror there was an area for hanging some clothes and a chest of drawers aswell as a safe the bathrooms were great obviously recently put in great big showers that were really powerful staff were always friendly and helped us out our room didnt come with a hairdryer but we asked if we could borrow one and it was no problem 
i really liked this hotel the decor the staff and the location are all great for what i paid for my stay here it was great value for money i would certainly stay here again and recommend it to anyone there seemed to be a wide range of people staying here too the surrounding area is so nice aswell felt really safe at night and was quiet

location location,hotel located across washington circle from foggy bottom metro station with many many tourist destinations withing walking distance had gotten a bargain online rate which i was able to upgrade for an additional fee at checkin we were celebrating my daughters birthday who lives in the area and the suite with full kitchen living  dining area was perfect to have some of her friends over the weather was amazingly warm so even enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the afternoon the condition of carpet furniture drapes etc was worn but for the price  location was a very good deal could also save money by getting food at nearby trader joes cvs or whole foods and using kitchen,4.0

a very pleasant stay,"we have stayed in many hotels and bbs in philadelphia and feel that the morris house offers comfortable accommodations and good value in an attractive and convenient setting our room was quite large with several comfortable chairs and a large bathroom the decor was pleasing and appropriate for the period of the building the young woman who checked us in was quite friendly and helpful and offered to carry my bag to the third floor other staff members were less friendly but did their job as expected breakfast was all that we required and thank heavens coffee was available quite early unlike some other hotels which offer only tiny tables for two for breakfast the morris house has the option of breakfasting at a large common table where we met and shared travel experiences with other interesting guests
 we have already arranged for a return visit to the hotel",5.0
stay was better than expected good staff,"got this hotel on hotwire and was promptly terrified from the reviews here but really it was fine except for forgetting to ask for a room with 2 beds so me friend and i were sharing a king 
the staff were amazing we were first checked into a room next to a screaming baby and when i called the front desk about a room swap they immediately sent someone up with 2 keys to a new room and we could move in our own time when we got to the new room there were zero noise problems when i asked about switching to a room with two beds the next morning the person at the desk brought out the manager to say that there were none and they were so apologetic over it even though my friend and i didnt make a fuss at all any question or request i had the front desk was more than happy to help and did it well we were pleasantly surprised by how nice they were oh i forgot my electric toothbrush there and they had it shipped out to me with next day service and only charged me 25 for it 
rooms were clean and comfy and dark always got a good rest 
the air conditioner was not too noisy and it runs all the time instead of those horrible offon cycles that will wake you up actually we would run the ac when we were out during the day and then turn it off overnight for perfect quiet it was cool enough at night to do that
bathroom is small yea but it was manageablejust cant have more than 1 person in there at a time bathroom fan was pretty crappy 
business center was bad they have trackball mice in there and the internet was disconnecting every few minutes but youre next door to the library and i think there was a computer with free internet in the lobby
being 1 block away from the subway was great",4.0
hawaiian escape,my husband 8year old daughter and i went to hawaii last month and of course had an amazing time i chose this hotel because of the hawaiianstyle decor that looked appealing over the internet when we got there we were pleasantly surprised at how much we felt like we were back in the hawaiian islands again from the moment we walked through the doors the service at the front desk was personable and accomodating the decor throughout this hotel was tropical and elegant our room was overlooking the poolside area and since we were on the 7th floor we had a nice view we had dinner at the islands restaurant inside the hotel and although the service was slow the restaurant personnel were friendly and accomodating as we were leaving the parking lot my daughter asked us when could we come back again definitely a nice hawaiian escape,4.0
great place,my family and i really enjoyed staying here staff was super friendly room was clean and comfortable we had great pillows breakfast was great they had a sweet lady making waffles for everyone i called front desk for extra towels and they were so kind to bring them in not time it was easy excess from expressway to attraction parks restaurants  downtown my wife is a teacher so we received a discount rate we just had to show them a check stub or proof of employment loved it,5.0
historic hotel excellent location,"ive stayed here multiple times and always enjoy my stay my most recent trip was for the july 4th holiday and i took advantage of their online checkin service for their select guests definitely the way to go so my keys were waiting for me when i arrived its just a few days before my birthday and when i entered the room i had 4 chocolate covered strawberries a bottle of champagne and a birthday card signed by numerous staff members waiting for me that sort of attention to detail and guest loyalty makes the omni chain one of the best in the country
ive read several reviews where previous guests have commented on the rooms being small and quite honestly this surprises me the parker house has been around for over 150 years and prides itself on being historicim not sure how one could expect their rooms to be cavernous in size or ultramodern personally i dont find their room size to be a problem im there to sleep not travel to boston and spend the entire time holed up in my guest room 
overall the guest rooms are always clean the beds are extremely comfortable the staff is professional and the breakfast is phenomenal the only two small gripes i had about my stay were there was a large red wine stain on the side of the bed in the room and there was also construction on school st at 6 am which woke me up i had ear plugs with me and was able to fall right back to sleep
i didnt take advantage of their barsrestaurants on this trip but i have in the past and have always enjoyed the food and service the boston creme pie is a must have",5.0
good but expensive,"stayed there in may12 for 2 nights doing business in nyc
the hotel is good centrally located well maintained and very clean bedrooms is classicly decorated with good bed well kept toilet there is free water and soda inside rooms
the gym downstairs has good equipment but is a little claustrophobic
had breakfast in the attached restaurant good service but expensive 20 dollars
overall the hotel is very good but for 400500 dollars it is way too expensive even considering that its nyc",4.0
will park for cookies,location was great easy access to freeways we even drove to santa cruz for a day at the beach and the drive back at night was fine the swimming pool was a huge hit for our family its very big in size with a lot of sitting areas around so it never felt too crowded the pool was heated to a perfect temp loved the cookies the only two negative things were the price to park at the hotel and there was no free internet service we were not informed before we made reservations that there would be an additional fee added on per day for parking but we figured out that if we actually had to pay for all the cookies we ateit would be more than what we paid for parking so needless to say we ate a lot we also ended up driving to starbucks to get a free internet connection,4.0
the hotel is great and the staff make you want to come back,i was incredibly impressed by the employees of this hotel my wife and i brought our 4 year old twin boys and couldnt believe how nice everyone was it is a trendy and cool hotel but the staff is what makes it memorable michele at the front desk was a standout and very kind she took the time to talk to the boys and even had a wii sent up to the room for them the next morning she asked them all about the lion king and made them feel comfortable and welcome the pool was awesome and the view of the empire state building from the pool is great our friends were with us with their daughter and loved it too we will be back and will recommend this hotel to our friends,5.0
you get what you pay for,"i recently brought a large group to this hotel and the first thing that comes to mind is you get what you pay for super cramped facilities terrible check in process malfunctioning locks and mediocre room service although there were some pros to this hotel the cons far outweighed them please refer to the following
pros
 cheap rates for the location two blocks from times square and you are literally in the center of everything
very friendly front desk staff the front desk manager did everything he could to accomodate my group
comfortable beds
free wifi
clean rooms
great continental breakfast
cons
poor business practices with the corporate group sales representative i have never dealt with so much pressure to make payment despite being a reputable entity contract terms created ahead of time were attempted to be changed last minute literally speaking the day before our trip
checkin time was promised to be earlier than our expected arrival time we did not get our final room until an hour and a half after arrival time this delayed our plans for the evening and as a large group this was extremely frustrating
very cramped space the hallways and rooms were small and uncomfortable for those traveling as a family or couple the space is ideal but for large groups i would not recommend this hotel
no fitness room
cramped seating for continental breakfast for a hotel accomodating so many individuals the cafe space lacked completely
room locks kept getting stuck
i have to make special mention that the staff was very friendly and did everything in their power to accodomate a group our size however prior to our arrival we were promised a number of things that did not come to fruition one of those things being that our rooms would be ready ahead of schedule i am understanding of the fact that corporate office may not have been in communication with the front desk 
all in all a mediocre experience",2.0
what a five star hotel should be,"the fairmont is a beautiful grand yotel from the facade to the lobby the rooms and the view everybody i interacted with was friendly and helpful although i didnt avail myself of the restaurants my room was in excellent condition on a high floor with a great view of the city the only problem there was that the windows needed to be cleaned the room had a good desk for work not enough power but whats new new tv comfortable bed and sparkling bathroom with separate tub and shower
the gym was very full of equipment but it wasnt the best gym in the citys hotels
my rate was really good especially compared with what else was available in the city in a time of high demand",5.0
relaxed elegance,"my husband and recently returned from another vacation at westgate hotel where we have stayed several times over the last few years we like to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries there because it is the perfect combination of quiet convenience excellent service and truly beautiful decor my husband prefers to stay in hotels where the rooms are large and the rooms at the westgate are quite spacious in addition to a wonderful restaurant on the first floor of the hotel it is within walking distance of some of the best restaurants in san diego it is also located directly across the street from horton plaza which houses nordstroms macys and many other chain stores
what we enjoy most is that we do not need to rent a car the mass transit system includes a bus that stops across from the hotel and travels to la jolla where there is much to see and do we have stayed at the grand colonial in la jolla which is also quite nice but there is so much more going on in san diego that we prefer to stay there and we always look forward to staying at the westgate",5.0
perfect deal for attending a ucla function,the ucla guest house is dedicated to hosting parents of students and other people who have business on campus our son sings in the ucla chorale and their holiday concert was on december 4 we usually stay in the oc with my sister in law when we go to southern california but this time driving from northern california on saturday and leaving on sunday made it a quick trip and we wanted a place close by and not expensive for los angeles the ucla guest house was the perfect match for our requirements it is located on campus on the quiet bel air side off hillgard and a 5minute walk from royce hall where concerts are held the rate for a queen room is 143 flat rate including free parking and complimentary continental breakfast there is no occupancy tax they have 61 rooms and about half the parking space which means its first come first serve for parking parking is indoors and safe if you dont get a parking space they sell you a 10 parking permit for lot 3 about a block away there is a loading and unloading space when you check in we had plenty of parking to choose from that day but heavy days like graduation could make it more difficult the airport shuttle drop off is a few steps away and so is the ucla shuttle stop the breakfast is tasty and is served from 630 am to 930 am we showed up at about 845 and some things were not replenished like the fruit so show up a little bit earlier to have everything also we did not get the wakeup call we requested although they offer this service and the front desk attendant said he would do it the room is small but comfortable there is a flat plasma tv with cable and a amfm alarm radio with a desk a chair and an armchair the decor is a little outdated and the bathroom older but everything is clean they provide all the basic toiletry amenities a hair dryer and an ironing table with ironthe two young ladies at the front desk are friendly the whole place feels like an older holiday inn quality the only other option in westwood is the w hotel at 295 a night  tax which does not include parking and breakfast so this was a good choice you also have access to all the ucla gym facilities for free with your electronic room key card you could walk to the westwood restaurants in about 1520 minutes but we drove since the parking lot was not full and we knew we would have space when we came backthe ucla guest house is the place we will stay at when our son graduates and for his other concerts and parents weekend for graduation and parents weekend you need to reserve 10months in advance because it fills up quickly,3.0
gorgeous hotel great service,"positives the fairmont is an absolutely gorgeous hotel with great customer service my room had a comfortable king size bed a huge flat screen tv a solid wood desk with a leather swivel chair a marble counter top and marble tile in the bathroom and an impeded room was quite large and also featured a large walk in closet i but decent view from a large window i was on the 5th floor the received excellent friendly customer service from every employee that i passed or encountered from bellhops to front desk clerks to waiters free wall street journals ny times and financial times available
negatives gym access is 15 per day high speed internet access is 13 per day
the fairmont is located at the very top of nob hill directly across the street from the intercontinental mark hopkins hotel which means that if you walk anywhere from the hotel your walk back will be a very strenuous uphill hike believe me the hill is extremely steep so unless youre in good shape youll probably want to take the trolley or a cab home the trolley runs right in front of the hotel
i definitely recommend this hotel and i would definitely stay here again",5.0

the bad
dont plan on eating breakfast there unless you eat like a bird and you like bread one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen especially from a major chain hotel plenty of places to eat nearby located across the freeway from amusement park which had a concert late at night yes you could hear it for free in the room this hotel is two buildings seperated by a parking lot they had one ice machine located in the office byo ice bucket because they dont have any for just over 100 dollars a night you get lots of room if you need it",3.0
nice stay but number 1,my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights whilst in transit to canada for a ski holiday based on reviews here whilst i agree that it is good value for money compared to other hotels in the area i am a little suprised that it still rates up there at no 1 i guess this is probably more of a value rating than anything else  the room we had the first night we arrived was unfortunately right next to the foyerbreakfast area and after a long flight from sydney we were a bit annoyed at the noisey clatter outside our door from 530 in the morning having said this we did request to be moved the following night and this was done with absolutely no fuss at all as all other travellers have said the staff are great the rooms are clean and relatively spacious and the location is pretty good the complimentary drinks at night is a lovely gesture but i cant vouch for the breakfast as we cose to dine at the nearby farmers marketsthis is a great hotel if you are just looking for somewhere to rest the head but does not offer much else in the way of facilities if you want to hang out at the hotel,4.0
nice hotel in seattle,"we stayed at the homewood for two nights prior to a cruise its located a little outside the downtown area so cabs are needed to get to most attractions except for the space needle area we walked from the public market one afternoon but it was too far for comfort the hotel was clean and well maintained but there was a bit of street noise which was easily eliminated by leaving the ac fan on breakfast was oktypical for this class of hotel with all of the great food we found in seattle breakfast was not a big concern for us
the hotel offers transportation to the cruise piers for an extra charge we reserved a private car but it did not show so the desk called us a cab this was probably cheaper method",4.0
fabulous hotel right in the centre of austin,we stayed here for 2 nights and we were very impressed with this hotel on check in we were delighted to get a free upgrade to a bigger room and it was beautiful the staff were very friendly and helpful and they gave us loads of ideas about things to do in austin we had lunch in the hotel bakerycafe both days and it was delicious the hotel is located on 6th st right beside all of the entertainment and only a short walk from the bat bridge we had a great stay here and would definately return in the future,5.0
ok hotel great location,i stayed at the millenium boston for a business trip the location is great as its right across from quincy market and around the corner from many local pubs cafes and shops my room was a bit on the small side and really dark the bed was comfortable the room was reasonably clean my view was across to a glassed in atrium area of the hotel the bathroom was very old with a brown ceramic tile floor yellow tile vanity and older fixtures the bathroom alone needs some serious updating overall a very clean hotel nice staff but the rooms are just average and definitely not up to date a good day at a good price,3.0
great location but the room was a little dirty,we always stay here when we go to nyc thankfully our room was bedbug free but we feel it couldve been cleaner we didnt ask for another room bc we knew ours was free of bedbugs and the sheets were clean too how much time do you spend in your room when youre in nyc anyway relatively comfortable beds friendly staff too,3.0
i definetly recommend it best deal for san francisco pier area,the price is great 9900 weekdays 179 weekends great deal extremely clean comfy beds this area is so darn expensive and we had a hard time finding something reasonable this place is nice for the money really close to the pier and attractions are all relatively close drive 4 blocks east and you run right into lombard street free parking allowed us to use the car every day breakfast is primitive but ok if you like muffins and a donut coffee is really good though just note the picture of the room on the net is the larger room not the ones on the upper floors be careful there we got the smaller room and we told them and they immediately put us in room 101 next to the office people are nice and i would stay again in a heartbeat,5.0
inoffensive and relatively affordable but unexceptional,"the emphasis is on east in upper east side as it is east of most attractions in a midrange residential nabe it is amidst many tower blocks and across from public housing which is not as scary as it may sound the locals there were quiet and the ares is safe if bland but a ten minute walk puts one in the heart of the ues and overall the courtyard served us well when we had a late mgmt concert at the guggenheim toooo cool
the rooms were small but stylish the lobby small and conservative in decor and the price for nyc was as low as one could expect withoug sactificing quality 300night 
not to be avoided by any means but try another spot if it is your honeymoon",3.0
do not stay therecheck in somewhere downtown instead,"just got back this hotel was the worst place i have ever experienced and i was prepared after booking that it was bad but this really shocked me even the cockroaches were checking out its such a shame because this hotel is rich with history but in desperate need of tlc i was moved 3 times because i just could not stay in the allocated room the first was on the 8th floor and it really was the most disgusting thing i have seen i went back to reception and the manager who must have heard it all before so was most unhelpful did give me another room which i thought was something from a horror movie the paint was chipping off the walls the bathroom had urine stains on the toilet seat the curtains were nonexistant and then i did the ultimate i checked under the sheets and mattress and yes you guessed it bed bugsby now it was 12am and i was exhausted so i slept fully clothes even with my shoes on on top of the bed using my coat to buffer the contact with the duvet and moved out the next morning this room was on the 2nd floor which resembled a youth hostel with all the college kids hanging around although even they were complaining the next morning i went back to reception and they moved me to the penn club executive room on 13th floor which was marginally better in terms of the room being painted and the furniture not looking like it was found in the garbage the maid even gave my room an extra clean and the benefits of this room was the complimentary breakfast which was a bonus but served in the smallest room ever so it was a cramped and rushed experience in the morning 
the reason why i do not believe this hotel will spend  to refurb is because it was full the entire week so why spend  when people are staying yes location is a  but i suggest stay in soho at a small boutique hotel and really get a comfortable enjoyable stay this hotel is a stain on nyc and it should be ashamed to be standing amongst the great city and i wonder how much repeat business they get so my advice is do not stay find somewhere else and hopefully the more bad reviews and reduced business they get will encourage the management to sort this place out 
if you do stay do not accept the first room allocated and make sure you check for bed bugs because they are still there but staying here will negatively impact your stay in nyc and that is the real shame of this place",1.0
not bad for philly,i had to stay at this hotel for a conference i have stayed here before in the past and it is a little pricey i actually like the loewes hotel across the street and they tend to also have cheaper rates too it looks like they finally remodeled the rooms i was pleased that they had a separate check in for elite members my room was clean but there was a layer of dust on the tissue holder in the bathroom i did also notice that for some reason my room always smelled like breakfastalmost like syrup and the hallway smelled like the grill so ventilation isnt the best and i was in the main buildingthey have a separate tower as well for elites they offered me a room in the main building so i didnt have to schlep back and forth which i did appreciate the bellman and the valet staff were very very nice and extremely pleasant its not a bad hotel for a marriott but there are some better places with cheaper rates,4.0
certainly not the best hotel,the hotel itself is certainly not the best hotel i have stayed at recently the rooms seem dated and need refurbishment while the view is stunning the rooms lack natural sunlight and seem gloomy even on a sunny day the hotel needs to improve on cleanliness  rooms as well as public areas such as the lobby furthermore being in an area that at night seems to be suffering from a high crime rate visible security would be appreciated to provide a sense of comfort and safety,2.0
amazing hotel with over the top services,"i was nicely surprised by this hotel i lived in manhattan for 10 years and actually never heard of this hotel 
location great right off madison avenue my windows were facing the street and i found the room surprisingly quite close to midtown and all shopping 12 block from the park
rooms amazing very large beautifully decorated marble bathrooms great interiors i tried several hotels in nyc but this one is my favorite now
food you have one of the best nyc restaurants in the hotel and plenty others to choose from around
service amazing custome services the concierge was fantastic i had to prod off a package and was asking where to find the closest ups drop off box  there was none withing 10 blocks concierge insisted he takes care of it for me and he did they checked me in for a flight even double confirmed a gate and waited 15 mins outside with my luggage to catch me a taxi in a rush hour cant beat that for a busy biz traveler",5.0
not bad but i didnt care for the surroundings,we stayed here because we were moving and this was the closest hampton inn to our house after a long day packing up our belongings i didnt want to drive very far i usually stay at hampton inns and the hotel itself was pretty nice the rooms were cleanand the staff were friendly i really didnt care for the location  its on the frontage road right next to i10,3.0
good for asians,my best friend just graduated from the marines and we stayed at this one from wednesay to saturday i thought i was in asian heaven the bed was more comfortable that my one at home and there is lots of great thai food in the neighborhood of it the staff was increadible the night person randy was really nice because i made him come open our room and change key and stuff like ten times and he always said no trouble at all hehe if i ever go to california again i will stay at this one just because of that the breakfast waffles were good too but i only had it once very close to trollys and lots of stuff to see i will remember my trip to here forever,5.0
great hotel  would definitely return if i can afford to,"having moved away from nyc after years of being a true new yorker ive always found it difficult to stay in a hotel when i come back into the city and have been able to for the most part avoid it by crashing at friends places when they are out of town 
recently though everyone was staying local when we came to visit and i booked a room at gild hall for a surprisingly low price online at quikbookcom the site had the warning caveat that the hotel was under construction thus the low rates no doubt during renovation we assumed safely that there would be little interfering noise on a weekend stay and booked a standard king room
new york city hotel rooms are notoriously tiny with variable amenities and equally variable staff attentiveness  imagine our surprise to enter into a quiet little world of wonderful i almost hate to write this review and out the hotel a supreme gem hidden waaaay downtown but i feel like i should share our experience
the entrance is on a tiny side street off gold st a 57 min walk from the fulton st subway stops which serves nearly all major subways lines one could want for while the hotel undergoes renovations the lobby is the size of a cubby but who needs more than that for check in we were double upgraded they informed us to some sort of deluxe king room compliments of the hotel and whether it was a line or a true upgrade the sentiment was kind and the room lovely  unbelievably high ceilings even spacious by nyc standards the bathroom was huge and came with fresh brand toiletries  quite highbrow actually and a thoughtful addition the room had the requisite and now ubiquitous ipod docking station and flat screen tv and an extremely comfortable bed as we were getting ready to go out turn down service rolled by and while we declined it was a nice touch for a fledgling boutique hotel
the room was quiet dark and blessedly free of radiator rattles construction or hallway noise even though we were right across from the elevator the water in the shower was hot the robe in the bathroom sumptuous and everything clean and orderly quite honestly  what more could you expect or want for
i know the hotel will grow the todd english tavern will move in and i imagine it will become quite the hot spot downtown with prices to match other thompson group hotels are not cheap but in the meantime its well worth booking a room even if its further downtown than you might normally consider in order to have the little quiet luxuries that gild hall offers before everyone else finds out about them too",5.0

an upscale courtyard with excellent service,"ive stayed at this courtyard on at least two different occasions  most recently for two nights in july 2009 this is a very nice courtyard with a slightly more upscale lobby lounge and restaurant than usual courtyard  extra touches include a supply of full size umbrellas at the main entrance for rainy days attractive clear glass iced water dispenser with lemon slices available in the lobby  tasted very good 
location excellent for easton you are steps from all that easton has to offer
airport shuttle yes but it may take 1015 minutes to arrive at the airport it did however arrive when promised and the shuttle was very clean and the driver very courteous limited service times so check with the hotel before you arrive important you need to schedule the shuttle for your return trip to the airport the day before your departure call an hour or two before the shuttle is scheduled to take you back to the airport to confirm i scheduled my shuttle the day before but did not call to confirm the morning of my departure there was a mixup so the van was not available no problem  see my remarks on service in the next section
service uniformly excellent everyone was just great and very helpful as i said above there was a schedule mixup with the shuttle to the airport but they called and paid for a cab right away nice job and greatly appreciated
room very nice immaculate quiet excellent bed flat screen tv powerful ac etc the bathroom was especially clean if you can get a view overlooking easton the view out the back of the hotel is ok though youre looking over part of easton and fields and offices in the distance 
breakfast excellent and only 895 for cookedtoorder eggs and omelets waffles fruit yogurt bagels english muffins bacon sausage oatmeal etc etc 
internet access it is complimentary and it works very well  fast and no problems
market there is a small market where you can buy snacks 24 hrs
bar in the evening for limited hours there is a nice bar and very attractive and comfortable lounge area where you can relax  nice touch
overall excellent ive paid much more at other hotels in easton and there was not much difference i will definitely return to the courtyard easton for future business trips excellent hotel excellent value",5.0
great location good service tiny rooms,the hotel atmosphere and service were nice the bedding was very comfortable request extra luggage racks to keep your things off the floor no tables for food and drinks  very inconvenient for room service the airheat extremely noisy all things considered the location is the best aspect of this hotel,3.0
great hotel in a good location,this a a really nice hotel in a great location the room was a good size for new york which was important because we were 4 women sharing one room it helped that the bathroom was nice and big comfortable beds great view clean rooms we also loved the wine service at 5 pm really friendly and helpful staff as well it is a bit expensive but it was perfect for sharing a room with friends and splitting the cost,5.0
comfortable middleclass hotel nicely situated for a sf city trip,i stayed there for business for 3 nights including the weekend if you want to visit san francisco downtown this is an excellent hotel it is modern rooms are well equipped and everything you want to see in the city is nearby eg chinatown on walking distance or the bay area the standard is typical for hilton good value for money higher middleclass standards standard rooms are not too big but that is okay because you will largely be outside isolation re city noise was no issue breakfast in the morning was well sorted there are plenty plenty of restaurants around which probably is the reason why the hotel restaurant is okay but not really special as there are too many alternatives inroom dining is a bit pricy the hotel itself is a buzzing hub of people given also that the inhouse starbucks counter keeps the crowd moving would certainly want to stay here again,4.0
fantastic hotel,"we have just come back from the sofitel in new york and were expecting great things after reading the other reviews on here we were not disappointed on arrival we were greeted at the door and excorted to reception whilst our bags were taken to our room check in only took about 5 minutes which was great after a 7 and a half hour flight all the staff were very polite although i did find their accents quite hard to understand and i think they thought the same of me we were escorted to the escalators and once we got to our room which was on the 23rd floor we found an amazing room with a bottle of champagne and a welcome card from all the staff the bed was gorgeous and just as comfortable as it looked the bathroom was huge and it had a shower big enough for 2 ooh errr and a separate bath also loads of free goodies and fresh flowers
the bed is incredibly comfortable and is hard to get out of in the morning but the promise of the wonderful shower helps the tv has 40 channels and their was always something on its particularly good for weather and times square info as their seemed to be different celebrities their on a daily basis there are also pay per view channels for the latest films if you have the time 
the room was cleaned once a day immaculately and a turndown service is offered between 6 and 9 which can be a little bit annoying as that was the time we usually were having a snooze before going out in the evening as all the walking does tire you out however this is when fresh water is given to you though and it is appreciated in the humid conditions of new york
we only visited the bar once it was very pleasant but not very lively and the drinks were on the expensive side 2 vodka and cokes were 24 dollars so make sure you have plenty of cash they do have very tasty complimentary bar snacks
overall our stay was wonderful the view from our room was very good too and the hotel is in a brilliant location for shopping and sightseeing all the staff went out of their way to help you especially the concierge who gave us free passes to two top nightclubs i would recommend this hotel to anyone you will not be disappointed",5.0
thoroughly happy traveler love this hotel,in the past thirty years i have travelled a great deal on business both home and abroad rare is the hotel that combines everything i desire at an affordable rate the francisco bay inn is located in downtown san francisco not far from many of the citys best attractions the hotel rooms were spotless well appointed quiet and the staff was very nice i was shopping for a business rate which i got there is a small elevator for upstairs rooms and although the parking is a bit difficult that is not unusual for san francisco my colleague also stayed at the inn and had a similar review so i feel safe that i am speaking for her too upon checkout there was a vase of yellow roses on the counter and i asked if i could have one for my friend to which the manager replied take two i will always call this hotel first when i am heading into san francisco,5.0
this hotel is wonderful,my mother and i stayed here for almost a week the rate was very affordable the rooms were very upscale for such a low rate with granite countertops hardwood floor fridge and microwave in our rooms the rooms were very quiet we had wonderful free breakfast everyday boiled eggs waffles oatmeal fresh fruit juice etc fresh hot coffee and tea were provided in the lobby 24 hours free of charge beautiful entry lobby free usa today everyday and free wifi the service was excellent friendly and helpful staff the inside and outside of the property were beautiful and clean we definitely felt like we got a great hotel for a great bargain i would definitely stay here again its one of the few hotels ive stayed at that i didnt want to leave grocery stores restaurants and gas stations are within walking distance very safe area the hotel also has a store where you can buy snacks frozen meals and toiletriesmedicine and the manager wears really cool boots where the toes tip up great experience highly recommend this place,5.0
couldnt ask for more for the money that we paid,very loved and warn hotel but couldnt have been cleaner which to me is what really matters i never went to a bathroom that hadnt been spotless it may be a little different in high season value for money is really good we had a large room with sink tv hair dryer and the room was always really warm which help when it was 3 outside we slept well and could not hear much road noise over all i would recomend this hotel to any one looking for a cheap and clean base for explorin the big city,5.0
this hotel was just ok,if you need a place to stay and you want a pool and breakfast and that is it then this is the place for you i got my room for 40 from priceline and i stayed for 5 nights so that was pretty cheap bad side there is no refridge or microwave at all there is an 8 dollar a night fee that annoyed the heck out of me the beds are not all that comfortable but they do the job there is very limited tv channels the pool and hot tub were nice breakfast was ok they had powdered eggs that were sometimes watery but overall things were good and there were a lot of choices waffles and pastries and all that coffee was great all the staff were super nice this property is located close to everything so that was helpful i dont know that id run to stay there again but if i bid on priceline again for this area i would definately bid lower to accomodate the parking fee,3.0
the good the bad and the ugly,i have stayed at this hotel several times alone with family and with friends and have mixed feelings first of all the rooms are much prettier than the blue seas down the street but i wouldnt say the beds are more comfortable it took me about 30 minutes just to find the closet behing the mirror the rooms come with a desk with a dataport and microwave and frig however the blue seas also has these things not to mention free wireless internet the main problem with this hotel for about the last year and a half is the construction of the new lifeguard tower right at the end of the street that the hotel is situated on since their parking is underneath the hotel all the construction made it very difficult to get in and out of the parking garage the one plus about their parking is that it is free whereas the bw blue sea lodge right down the street in mission beach charges 6 or 7 a night for their parking and they have underground and outside parking in pacific beach however it doesnt matter where you stay all parking places are very tiny and now even more so with the rage for suvs anyway the pool is not as large as the one at the pacific terrace or the blue sea but it is warm and the jacuzzi is nice however their pool area closes at 10 well they say it closes at 10pm the last time i stayed at this hotel there were several of us in the jacuzzi having a pleasant conversation enjoying the evening at about 9pm915 management shut off the jacuzzi then at around 930945 they shut the lights off in the pool area i couldnt believe it we had been looking forward to using the pool area all day at a time when there would be less children and they closed it early when we complained the security guard person became very rude and asked us to leave now this hotel admittedly has a beautiful view of the beach and the ocean but just like every other property in pacific beach or mission beach you do have the problem of homeless people and once in a while a drunk causing trouble right outside your windown on the boardwalk but that comes with the territory this is a big city and there are homeless people who live down on the beach and it is a college party town so there will be drunks but i think the sound of the ocean at night and the proximity to the beach makes up for most of it i never feel unsafe in pacific beach i just use good judgment at any rate i have had problems with this hotel with billing i have never gotten a straight answer from the front desk on whether or not 800 number calls are free or charged sometimes they are free and sometimes not also i had a problem with the hotel releasing the hold they had on my credit card after the charge had already come through i had to make several calls to the hotel after i got home from my trip and was sassed by an employee over the phone and told i should just wait well i called again a few days later and complained and miraculously the hold was finally released the blue sea lodge and the ocean park inn charge about the same for their room rates and there are a lot of pros and cons of both properties but after the incident at the pool i dont think ill stay there again during one of my stays at this hotel my friend who walks with a cane asked if she could have a room close to the elevators they put her in the last room at the end of the hall in the wing on the other side of the pool as far from the elevators as she could get when she asked if they would move her they told her there was nothing they could do about it well it happened to me the next time i stayed there with family and i immediately called the desk and insisted they move us which they did so sometimes they are accomodating and sometimes there are not i have to admit this property is in much better repair that the blue sea and i have been there many times twice when the pool was shut down and once when the elevator was broken i have even considered staying at the pacific terrace but for much the same situation they charge about double so i have put up with the situations at these two properties again even though the rooms are nicer at the opi than at the bsl i probably will not stay at this hotel again and will return to the bsl where i am treated better and they have warm chocolate chip cookies waiting for me at my arrival also at the bsl if the room is not what you want they will work with you until you find just the perfect room one time they gave me about 6 keys and told me to go check them out and pick the one i wanted hows that for accomodating another reason why i would choose that hotel over the opi just remember none of these properties are the ritz carlton they are in a touristresort town and get heavy traffic and heavy abuse,3.0
modest room with the basics great location,stayed at the lexington recently and was satisfied with the room a modest sized room with not much of a view room was clean but bathtub was a little dusty room was without water boiler which was quite a downer overall friendly staff and great location,3.0

only recommend to enemies,arrived late did get checked in fine towels are the same that i wash my car with but a bit rougher remote control is given to you when you check in the remote didnt work well and was very basic the reception for the tv was a bit snowy the water takes forever to just get luke warm the water pressure is great if you run around you may get your entire body wet no clock radio in the room we could easily hear the people above us and next door i will not stay there again they did have free parking but it was limited and a bit difficult to maneuvre however this is a plus in this area of town,1.0
the worst hotel experience i have ever had do not stay here,this was my frist time visiting nyc which can be overwhelming enough but when you go to check into your hotel after finding it through the never ending strees of nyc and you experienced what i did you may never want to go back when i first went to check in they had doublebooked my reservation noting that i had booked 2 rooms instead of 1 which was not the case i had all my paperwork and confirmation numbers and emails that i had been receiving about my upcoming stayetc so instead of even caring that two reservations were made the guy behind the desk just wanted my money so he said here sign this and then youll have to call this reservation company and figure out how to cancel it unbenounced to me i booked it through a reservations company that they use to book their hotel rooms therefore that company gets a commission so automatically he could just blame it all on them i was not going to sign anything until the 1 reservation was cancelled so for the sake of me actually staying at the hotel the man said he took care of it and would just deal with it later and i got a cancellation number etc at this point i was completely stressed out we were supposed to go to a show and were running out of time so then we finally go up to the room and were going to just drop our stuff and go but all of a sudden there was a knock on the door and a man asked us if our tap water was working so we turned on the sink faucet and saw that the water was brown dirty and disgusting and brown so at this point we turned on the sink and tub and let it run while getting on the phone to book another hotel once were luckily confirmed at another hotel we went back down and checked out which was a whole other nightmare the man said he would give us another room but i did not want another room in a dirty hotel with horrible customer service he never apologized or anything at this point we were late for our show so we had to pay a cancellation fee as that was our only option to get out there i then had to spend my weekend stressing about the numerous credit card charges on my card and am still fighting to get the cancellation fee removed it was by far the worst experience ever do not ever stay here save yourself a lot of time money and stress ridiculous that thye are even in business,1.0
great location and price,we really enjoyed our stay here the room was sizeable and the bathroom quite large we were on the 8th floor and didnt notice the street noise the front desk was very helpful with all of our questions would definitely stay here on our next trip to the city we got an excellent rate but then we booked the hotel probably about 4 months in advance,4.0
nice hampton inn,i stayed here on a recent business trip it was convenient to the meeting location as hampton inns gothis one was very nice and the staff was exceptionally professional and friendly i gave the location only a three just because im a runner and this location seems to be bounded by highways and very busy streets with a lack of sidewalks,5.0
unexpectedly good,"our family stayed here for 3 nights  our last 3 nights in san diego we were relocating out of the country for my husbands next assignment definitely a welcome comfort after weeks of packing and moving 
the 5 of us stayed in a suite it was great very large living room with a queen sofa bed and bedroom with 2 queen beds there was an lg hdtv the living and bedroom very spacious it could fit all our stuff  about 10 luggages beds were very comfortable housekeeping was a little slow probably because only 1 staff took care of the whole section airconditioning was a little loud but the comfortable room more than made up for it 
our package included breakfast at their restaurant which was ordered from the menu excellent food and fantastic portions the place also wasnt over crowded kids ate free 
my husband had to complete a report so they gave him a private business lounge to work in for a whole day complimentary it was nice  couches computer printer kashi energy bar and fruit was in the room

chicago stay  october 2022nd,"i recently traveled to chicago for business and stayed at the sheraton chicago if you are up for experiencing the amenities of this beautiful city and staying in an over the top hotel this is the place for you 
this hotel is strategically located within walking distance of one of chicagos best shopping experiences the miracle mile and is just blocks away from navy pier taking in these mustsee experiences in downtown chicago will be convenient and enjoyable while staying at this beautiful hotel

parking is convenient and safe with the sheratons valet or selfparking options with elevator service directly to the hotel lobby

great experience using hilton honors points,we had 3 rooms for 3 nights while in town to catch a game at fenway and do some siteseeing the hotel is in a great location  within walking distance to shops restaurants and easing access to the subway since we were using hilton honors points i was afraid that wed be given rooms in an undesirable location no view i was worried for nothing all 3 rooms on the 12th floor had wonderful city views one of the rooms was on a corner and had a sweeping view as well as a huge shower no tub with shower heads on both ends our room was always cleaned beautifully and the staff in the restaurant during breakfast was wonderful the beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows boston is an expensive city to visit but when we get more hh points well be back,5.0
very nice and affordable,"i must say im glad i stayed at this hotel i was just reading the reviews on here and im glad i listened to the good ones 
this hotel had just recently been renovated and is very very nice the lobby and our room as wel as the restaurant were all in excellent condition the parking is 12day in a gated and guarded lot i had to smoke outside because my room was nonsmoking since i had children with me i felt comfortable smoking outside by myself at 100 am and i am a female now i do not know much about la but it did not seem dangerous in the slightest i had a 2 queen beds room it was very spacious with nice furnishings the bathroom was large the pool was very nice and heated it is outdoors inthe corner of the parking lot but there is a 6 foot concrete wall around it you dont feel like your in the parking lot and no one outside can see in the pool area there is a nice outdoor courtyard in the center of the hotel and a nice sauna the breakfast in the morning was more than nice several beverage choices and hot  cold foods 
however the staff was not very helpful with directions to attractions or anything about where to go in the area the staff was not very friendly or helpful with anything the maid yelled at me in the morning cause i asked her to come back in an hour when we would be gone out for the day the front desk staff was very short and uninterested the breakfast staff was halfway okay they were efficient so i really didnt ask them for anything though
overall i give this hotel an a due to the bad staff",4.0
helpful,i have found your attendant derrek to be very helpful and prompt i needed to work on my laptop and i shared with derreck that i could not use the internet he promptly reset the system and i was able to complete my work he was a lifesaver,4.0
excellent location wifi substandard,"we chose this hotel for the location to the mall and museums the location did not disappoint and around the corner are various coffee shops banks pubbars and restaurants this is important because the hotel wifi had a very weak signal so i would go to starbucks to use their free wifi when we inquired the front desk had no explanation and offered to move us to another room we decided not to change rooms because of the hassle if hotels advertise free wifi they should make sure its adequate especially since this is in a business district the wifi in the lobby and breakfast room was acceptable but not acceptable in our 4th floor annex room
housekeeping was inconsistent we hung our towels on the rack as instructed the first night only to have them all replaced on the 3rd night we didnt think housekeeping had come by at 5pm because the beds werent made note that we put the beds together in a tidy fashion so they werent a mess to begin with but still it turns out they emptied the garbage cans and replaced the towels and that was it
i concur with the other reviews that the kitchen sink is too small to do dishes however the kitchen was nicely appointed with a full size refrigerator with an ice maker 2 burner electric stove and a large microwave the kitchen could have been stocked with kitchen towels however as we had to use the bathroom towels
the front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful
there is a computer and printer in the lobby which was helpful to print boarding passes 
on another note i booked this hotel via their website 6 months prior 2 months prior i checked the website again and the rate had dropped 100night im glad i checked again as the original rate was very pricey",3.0

poor spa customer service and maintenance,we live near the arizona biltmore and have been members of their spa facility for more than 10 years over that period of time we have seen a steady decline in the maintenance of the spa facility while they have recently replaced all of the equipment which is excellent the facility itself is poorly maintained in a clear cost cutting effort the hotel has reduced the hours that the gym will be staffed now instead of staffing at 530 am they will not staff until 730 am while they are making it 24 hours the locker room will not be available until 730 am for what is supposed to be a world class hotel they are running the spa and gym as if it were not an integral part of a major resort other resorts at least make bathrooms available at all hours in addition cleaning of the facility is now left to the operational staff during normal business hours as a result staff will be vacuuming while people are sitting in the lounge anyone coming to the biltmore because of the spa and gym may wish to reconsider and select another hotel that values it spa users and club members,3.0
nice hotel but problems spoiled the experience,"my boyfriend and i stayed here for 3 nights last month for businesspleasure he was there for a convention but we extended our stay to do some sightseeing first the good points nice roomhotel decor good maid service very convenient location pleasant staff members
now onto the bad it states that checkin is at 400 but our room wasnt ready until 500 which i think is a little late for checkin they allow pets which may be nice for some people but the fact that we were placed in a room next to a woman with a yappy dog who barked incesantly for hours was extremely annoying we called down to the front des who alerted security they came up and verified that yes there was indeed a barking dog next door but didnt do anything about it also this same dog decided to relieve itself in the hallway while we were walking to the elevator with this particular pet owner in my opinion i think that there should be a designated floors for people who bring their pets with them to this hotel so its not an inconvenience for those of us who left ours at home the second issue i had with this hotel was the elevators for most of our stay 2 of the 6 elevators were out of service and this was a major inconvenience at times we waited 15 minutes for an elevator which is ridiculous my last issue with this hotel is that we had booked 3 nights through my husbands company and an additional night through his hilton honors points as a reward night stay at checkout they not only charged us for the reward night but also charged us for the reward night a second time on the original bill and stated we were a no show on the last night when my boyfriend called to rectify this situation they stated it would take 3 days to clear this up hes still waiting
in summation this is a lovely hotel but the problems that we experienced during our stay would probably deter us from booking at this hotel again if it was strictly for pleasure",3.0
great hotel stayed for final four weekend,this hotel was a great find for our stay for the final 4 last weekend the hotel itself was very clean the staff was wonderful and we had no complaints what so ever the hotel was completely full for this big event and the staff had no problems from what i noticed the breakfast area was great lots to chose from each morning the pool was a bit cold still so we didnt use it but the hot tub was nice enough and we sat in it nightly after the games i would stay here again if we returned to houston it is also located conveniently to the galleria area as well as many places to eat high marks from our perspective ,5.0
my home away from home,"i stayed at the roger the week after hurricane sandy hit as i was unable to get back to my apartment after the storm it was a perfect boutique hotel i felt very comfortable living there for the week while also feeling completely spoiled by the wonderful staff every time i left my room i was greeted with a smile from housekeeping offered help with my bags by the bellmen the front desk was extremely helpful and patient and the food  beverage department was outstanding 
i think the other comments didnt take into consideration that the hotel was also impacted by the hurricane but from my experience i dont think you would have ever known it because they really pulled it together perfectly they created amazing meals with a limited menu until the new york vendors got back up and running the breakfast was unlike anything i have ever seen before and the cocktails were delicious and presented beautifully whatever you requested they made it happen even if it wasnt on the menu excellent service 
also the location was extremely convenient located in the heart of new york it made it easy to get uptown or downtown
by the end of the week everyone on staff was a friendly face and i felt so comfortable staying there it was a perfect home away from home i wish i could live there yearround 
thank you",5.0
great location good for an extended stay,"stayed here for five weeks in novdec 2007 
hotel location is excellent round the corner from broadway less than ten mins walk from macys two minutes from bryant park five mins from fifth avenue and about ten mins walk from the port authority good for those who want to take a day trip to woodbury common shopping mall  highly recommended hailing a taxi from outside the hotel wasnt difficult and theres a subway station right beside it 
my room on the 35th floor was quiet and had a view north up 6th avenue and over bryant park it had the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in  no exaggeration the bathroom was small but very clean and nicely appointed shower was excellent and there was also a bath the room had a safe an ironing board and a proper iron theres a laundry in the basement which costs a dollar per wash and per dry  washing powders available free from the front desk the dry cleaning service was good  same day delivery and the prices werent bad broadband internet access was available by wireless but could be a bit slow my only issue with the room would be that it was very stuffy there was no way to open the window further than a few centimetres so getting fresh air in was a bit difficult 
there was a kitchenette with a huge fridge and a dishwasher these were useful but i could have done with a hob or ring for saucepans  i hadnt been made aware that this was available on request theres a 24hour deli on the corner of the block next to the hotel you can also get hot snacks at the hotel bar on the second floor its tiny but nice and has a pool table theres a hospitality hour in the evenings from monthurs where snacks soup salad and so on are served to guests breakfast is really rather good  selection of hot food like sausages bacon potatoes french toast waffles pancakes oatmeal and so on skip the eggs as they were nasty as well as pastries bread cheese and fruit id advise getting down to breakast as early as you can as it gets a bit hectic after 830 particularly on weekends 
as other reviewers have pointed out the single biggest problem the hotel has is its elevator system getting a lift in either direction between 830 and 1030 was very difficult  i waited up to ten minutes on occasion it appeared that some of the lifts werent even in service as it seemed to be the same two that were always in use at breakfast time
front desk service on arrival and during the stay was fine however on departure i encountered some problems there was absolutely no flexibility as regards checkout times i requested checkout of 2pm but was told i had to be out by 1130 at the latest or else id have to pay for another halfday this despite the fact that we had paid for thirty nights already also the manners of the male concierge left a lot to be desired quite at odds with any other hotel concierge ive dealt with the doormenporters were pleasant and polite 
all in all it was a nice stay  if the residence inn irons out those few wrinkles in its service ive no doubt itll get more fivestar ratings from those on prolonged stays",4.0
very helpful and accomodating,i was here for a convention and the staff was very helpful when our group needed anything the hotel staff took care of it immediately the room i was in was comfortable and clean i appreciated the refrigerator and microwave in the room although not all rooms had them there was ample parking for our group and the hotel was easy to get to i would definitely stay here again,4.0
fantastic the place to stay when visiting san diego,i travel for a living staying in hotels and resorts around the world from the minute i arrived the valet was ready to assist with my car as was the bellman which was definitely needed when on the road for two weeks and with three girls traveling this time around  needless to say we had lots of luggage i was impressed by the friendly and accomodating service right from the start the lobby was beautiful and screamed relaxing the check in was flawless and up to the room we went fast elevator with a british accent welcomed me to my floor opened the door to the room and wow was i and my travel mates impressed coffee is a must for me so the first i noticed was the upgraded coffee machine with real mugs and real creamer not powdered the room was furnished lovely  fantastic for us ladies  bright cheery and in the colour of the season  orange the room was oversized extremely clean and exactly what i had hoped for need i say the beds were terrific and rather than enjoying the night out we decided to stay in also loved waking up to the spacious bathroom and huge shower area we checked out the 9th floor bar as everyone speaks of enjoyed the view service and fire box which kept us warm which made us again think as to whether we should be going out wine selection was definitely enjoyed as was again the staff we did eventually venture out and found very popular hot spots all within walking distance to the car each day we throughly enjoyed mainly because of this fabulous hotel and outstanding service always with a smile and ready to please darren at the hotel provided us great tips for places to visit and see which really made our visit and overall experience he was as they say the icing on the cake sadly our visit had to come to an end and im ready to start packing for a new trip i can only hope that i have the level of service and quality of standards that i experienced at this indigoand i can only hope i wish i was going back to san diego what a lovely and fun city and i wish my new hotel was the indigo i truly hope the hotel knows as to what they have and the hotel manager knows what heshe has in their team,5.0
great location staff helpful and friendly if youre into clean hotel rooms you might want to skip this one,we loved our stay in chicago and we cant wait to go back the convenience of the hotel was a definite advantage we felt safe at all times we realize now that chicago in general is pricey but thats ok  we never regret money spent on a trip speaking of pricey  the cost of the breakfast buffet at the hotel is 23 per person we would have liked to have had a usable fridge in the room the lack of this amenity makes it family unfriendly there is no counter space in the bathroom and speaking of bathroomsthere was a horrible sour smell in there and really bad mildew and mold in the shower on the tile grout i really needed a bottle of tilex pictures of the recently remodeled rooms are a little deceptive the rooms look huge in the pics they are not honestly  this hyatt seems to be more for the business traveler and not so much a family but believe it or not  because of the location  we would stay there again ill just make sure i bring my tilex,4.0
nice hotel in a great location,very pleased with this hotel from the moment i arrived and they let me check in early 10 am to the day i departed the lobby is gorgeous staff very nice location perfect if you want to be near times square only a block away and in a decent size room with a very comfortable bed and free wifi i even had a view of times square the rate was very good for the area so i wasnt sure what to expect but i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely stay there again,4.0
lots of personality,i stayed here because the block rooms were sold out at the designated hotels for our conference i was glad i found the hotel san carlos this is not your hotel if you want a hyatt or westin experience this is the place for you if you enjoy history and a little of the out of the ordinary it s decor is dated but what what youd expect for a historic hotel it is very clean and has all the modern conveniences the pool area was very nice and a great place to relax i stayed in the marilyn monroe suite which consisted of 2 rooms and was great for having guests staff were friendly and helpful i would definitely recommend this if you want something with a little more personality unfortunatley i had no ghostly encounters but enjoyed my restful nights,4.0
great time at rancho bernardo inn,i have stayed at the rancho bernardo inn for the last several years while we visit some family that live in san diego i look forward to to this trip all year we were only there for 4 short nights however i would have loved to stay longer we did manage to spend some time at the family pool where we ordered a wonderful lunch and enjoyed some drinks by the pool it was a great afternoon for the adults along with the kids who spent the day in the pool playing with some of the pool toys that were provided by the resort one morning i even had the pleasure of going down to the spa and having a wonderful swedish american massage and after the massage i spent some time in the steam room i could have spent all day in the spa but i had to get back to the room to spend some time with the family on the evening we ate in the veranda there was an excellent buffet that was going on so half of our party ate from the buffet and then the rest of us ordered off their menu of course we also made time to eat in el bizcocho we didnt bring the kids along since this restauarant is much more of a fine dining experience after reading all of the stories about el bizcochos chef we were definitely not disappointed the food presentation and service there is absolutely incredible i can say nothing but good about the rancho bernardo inn  everyone should experience it,5.0
the hotel is back,stayed after the new renovations the exterior is the same but the rooms have been updated the rooms have a great tv with ipod hookup and the remote controls all lights and ac the only issue is that the bugs still need to be worked out with the electronics the staff went out of their way to help however the food was great and the overall experience was very nice the occupancy was not up to the previous levels but should be soon,5.0
customer service is a joke to this hotel,"i would highly advise not staying here no one at the front desk management office or anywhere in between wants to work they do not even acknowledge you when you approach the front desk the gm actually told me they did not care about customer service 
and sleep in a plastic bag so you can avoid all the bed bugs i was switched from 3 rooms and finally had to leave the place of course they would not give my money back gross",1.0
wow what an amazing experience,i was overwhelmed with pleasure with my stay at the resort and also my experience at the spa i was in town on business and would highly recommend choosing this resort theres nothing like it go go go,5.0
excellent place to stay in downtown indianapolis,"my family and i stayed two nights at this hotel just after the final four the hotel is located on the west side of downtown and is adjacent to the indianapolis convention center it is in walking distance of downtown across the street from the hotel you have the ncaa national headquarters and the indiana state museum the hotel is brand new and opened in february 2010 it is adjacent to fairfield inn and courtyard by marriott all three hotels share an underground garage that sits beneath the hotels self parking in the garage is 20day and valet parking is 25day there is a well appointed tgifridays located in the fairfield inn and you can dine there or have it delivered to your room through room service
the hotel is very well appointed and serves a continental breakfast every morning rooms are well appointed and are trendy each room has a large phillips lcd hdtv with plenty of hd channels available free internet is available via wifi or wired connections wifi signal strength is very good and download speeds were 15 mbit consistently the room has an independently controlled hvac system with a digital thermostat microwave and small cube fridge the bathroom design is somewhat interesting in that is a split bathroom the main sinkvanity and tub are in one room and the toilet and small sink are located in another area the beds were very nice with high quality sheets and coverings the night stand contained a phone along with an ihome clock radio with ipod dock
as for other features a fitness room was available with a variety of equipment available the hotel features a very small indoor pool that probably could safely fit about 20 people in it a business center is available where you can check your email and print off boarding passes the lobby is well appointed with free coffee and wifi the breakfast area was very clean and offered a variety of hot and cold items for breakfast typically scrambled eggs and sausage patties were available along with a doityourself waffle machine a variety of cereals bagels and juices were available as well 
for dinner as mentioned previously a tgifridays is located over in the fairfield inn other restaurants are located in downtown and can be easily accessed by foot car or taxi
overall this was an excellent hotel with quiet well appointed rooms and other ammentites",5.0
so much better than the grand hyatt around the corner,"was bracing myself for another stay in the worn down and dank grand hyatt when i realized my hyatt points would work at andaz hooray
great hotel exceedingly comfortable and spacious rooms love the free beverage policy and the library selection in the lobby location is fabulous too staff were pleasant
the 2 negatives 
the coffee shop breakfast was poor quality and expensive the restaurant itself is inviting and always seemed to be people having coffee and snacks
as mentioned by others the staff while hip and friendly are quick to answer about things they dont know about ask them to call the manager to get results
still will never return to the grand hyatt and much prefer this andaz to w wall st although w staff seem to have more thorough training",5.0
great room for family amazing views,"we had an amazing time here booked a regular room with hopes of getting a better deal for a room with a view once we got there and we did
literally a couple of feet from the sand the room had a microwave mini fridge coffee maker and a little sink area and 2 queen beds and was very clean 
the best part of course is the balcony our corner room on the 1st floor with the amazing view of the ocean
we could watch the kids playing in the sand from our balcony and that was so convenient 
would definitely come back but do get the room with a view",5.0
cool design hotel for a good price,i love the interior design at this hotel  all the little detailsthe rooms are very cozy the beds supercomfy you even sort of love that youre sleeping almost right on top of the 405 its so well quintessential la right this hotel is very cool and chic for a more affordable price than other boutique hotels nearby my only issue was the very bad very cheesy technopop playing too often and too loud in the lobby by the pool pretty much almost anywhere except your room thank god,4.0
solid choice,average garden inn has a fridge and a microwave bed was okay room could have used a little more lighting my room has a nice view of a little pond and trees the room service comes from a restaruant across the parking lot their pizzas are really really goodive gotten about 4 of them staff is friendly id stay here again,4.0
do not stay here,disgusting room was filthy there was a cockroach on my nightstand on my last day had the impression room hadnt been cleaned for ages gross breakfast area was nasty too staff was friendly,1.0
it was just a place to sleep,"this hotel was just a place to sleep the hotel itself is above a ymca and you have access to use the gym and pool during the hours that they ymca is open the room was an older typical hotel room that has not been updated recently but it had a large fridge and a kitchen the view is of the street  nothing to exciting location wise its ok  if its not raining you can walk the freedom trail over the bridge in and out of the downtown area of the city but i would not recommend this hotel to nonwalkers you can also take the ferry downtown which is a nice ride but the ferries stop running at 6 pm schedule varies based on time of year so check the schedule applicable to your visit there arent very many choices for restaurants near the hotel and there were only a few places that would deliver food there room service is not available
no frills clean helpfulfriendly staff would stay again",3.0
dont bother,"i would stay well away from this place not only is it more hassle than its worth to get paperwork sorted out just to get in but the doormen and owner of the particular unit were of no help whatsoever the fridge was not working i think the cleaner forgot to come back after turning it off to defrost the kitchen was flooded the shower curtain was not held up properly and only lasted 1 shower and if you are taller than 57 you wont fit in the bed 
on the plus side its only a 10 minute walk straight up 47th st to times square and there is parking right next door if you are willing to pay a fortune for it
 in my opinion there has to somewhere alot better for the price and i will certainly be looking for it next time im in new york",2.0
great location but not a true nonsmoking hotel,"we stayed for 4 nights in august 2001 to visit family and sight see in chicago the hotel was great location close to family and tourist attractions in the city the hotel is funky in a positive sense we has a queen bed room and had plenty of room to recieve a discounted rate i had 3 reservations so when i checked in i was give 30 credit to use in the room bargreat i signed up as kimpton memenr and ercieved free wifi in my room whihc was great my only concern was the hotel is considered nonsmoking however we and other guests complained for several days since other guests were smoking in thier rooms the smoke smell was very strong in the hallway however we couldnt smell it in our room the hotels staff after the first day was to spray perfume in the area which we and other guests determined it was worst than the smoke the staff responded that they would handle it and charge the guests a fee for smoking but that didnt stop the smoking my thougths are how about asking them to leave the hotel you could tell when they checked out since the smoke smell was gone
overall the stay was a great location for us but im not sure i would recommend to other to stay at this kimpton property we have stayed at other kimptons in ther cities and the hotels were very different",3.0
enjoyable and pleasant stay fantastic view of times square,"my wife younger daughter and i visited nyc this past weekend nov 1215 2010 where we enjoyed a very pleasant stay at the marriott marquis the hotel room was clean and quiet with a fantastic view of times square 
we did not eat at the hotel but rather went to local restaurants one restaurant which we particularly enjoyed was juniors right across the street on the south side of the hotel a great place for breakfast 
other than at check incheck out we had very little interaction with hotel staff in general we found them to be friendly and attentive 
we found the hotel ideally situated for shopping and going to a show the gray line bus tours were great i would stay here again",5.0
fabulous hotel,what a gorgeous hotel with amazing service the staff members are all lovely and helpful i got there a little early because of my flight and they had a room ready right away the staff was very helpful with suggestions and directions the rooms are beautiful and clean the bar area of the room has ice in a freezer so you dont have to call up every time you want ice i love that turn down service and they leave water bottles on your nightstand while i was there for business while my husband was home with the kids i called him while watching tv in the bathroom mirror from the tub he said that really sounds like you are working hard haha great area feels very safe for a solo traveler easy to walk around the city close to lots of shops and restaurants i would recommend this hotel to everyone i would love to come back for pleasure instead of work next time and bring my husband,5.0
owwwwww really great stay,great hotel modern and classicchic very good location just one block from the waterfront and great restaurants really nice and big room with super confort bed room with lots of amenities nice bathroom i had a great view from my room they also let me check in at 8am they have a great restaurant inside a starbucks and a guy in the lobby that can help with maps and info about the area really close from south station and the silverline stop right in front the hotel i ordered room service food and the only complaint is the 4 they charge for delivery which is not great cause the restaurant is inside the hotel maybe a 10 min drive to the airport,5.0
great staff and accomodations,"i stayed here for two weeks during a recent business trip to the area and was thoroughly impressed with the facilities and the amenities breakfasts in the morning were decent certainly plenty of options with regards to both healthy and standard egg and toast type breakfast i cannot speak to the dinners as i chose to take advantage of the kitchen in my room  i did however enjoy a few cold beers which was quite nice the kitchen in my room as well as the other rooms  i was told by a staff member do not have measuring cups among a few other kitchen essentials it wasnt too big of a deal as the wonderful woman she was a doll and good at her job who works evenings preparing and serving dinner lent me the hotel kitchens measuring cup so i could make my rice the maid service was quite consistent as well minus the fact that they forgot to replace my kitchen towels and rags once again no big deal as i was able to simply use an extra set from the bathroom also i had to ask for additional ice bags for the ice bucket they provide
my one gripe which i was surprised no one else mentioned  the wireless internet is dreadfully slow it literally caused nearly all my apps on my tablet to time out due to the poor bandwidth additionally it made updating my work systems on my laptop impossible not terribly friendly for anyone who would like to get work done from their room 
all in all i would recommend this hotel to others and would not mind returning",4.0
nice people but a little chaotic for the price,"id love to be able to rate the wardman park marriott as excellent on all counts it should have been but it kept falling down on small details when i book into an expensive hotel i expect them to leave my working papers untouched  but the wardman park leaves nightdresses untouched too and doesnt make up the bed if youve left your nightie on it come on guys  this is supposed and priced to be a classy joint and the housekeeper left me a snotty message on my room phone when i suggested that good hotels fold pyjamas as part of bed making more often than not the water bottles werent renewed unless we called down  though shampoos etc kept arriving even if we didnt use the old ones whenever we called down to concierge or housekeeping things were fixed immediately  but we had to make far too many calls 
other things were variable too  the volume of spirit in a short varied from day to day in harrys bar for instance and of course theres the usual business that every cheap motel has free wi fi but top of the line hotels charge through the nose by the day  and it is slow slow slow but one expects that
valet service cleaning is excellent quality and good value but dont expect to get it back on time  we were late for a formal dinner waiting for a suit to come back but they charge less than my local cleaner who isnt as good so ill forgive them  in fact next time im in the vicinity ill have a suitcase full of dry cleaning with me
air conditioning is fairly quiet and very responsive desk could be bigger all the staff are both friendly and polite  just not quite as well trained as they should be from top to bottom 
views from the concierge floor are stunning 
value is fine if you are getting conference rates but rip off if you pay anything approaching full price",4.0
solid choice,service is the top pointbhere everyone wants to help and is very pleasant clean hotel flat screen tvs decent size rooms comfy bedspillows a sure thing,5.0
location wins,"this hotel was the first stop for our west coast self drive honeymoon when we landed in san francisco i already knew that i was going to love it
first impressions of the hotel were ok its a typical city centre hotel and we went through the main entrance to the reception area which was quite small but very friendly staff behind the counter we had been upgraded to a king size room as it was our honeymoon and free bottle of fizz waiting for us too nice touch our room was more than adequate although the bathrooms were tiny they were refurbising when we got there so this could well be different now the room was lovely and perfect for a 3 night stay we had a beautiful view of san francisco bay
as my title this hotel deserves its stars purely because of its location its perfect we left from the rear entrance and thats it we were in the wonderland that was fishermans wharf walk 2 minutes the other way and you were at pier 39 which was wonderful with some lovely places to eat we ate in bubba gumps i know not a particuarly classy restaurant but the shrimp was amaaazing and it was good fun with some lovely cocktails and views of the bay
walk the other way and you go further down fishermans wharf and eventually get to ghirardelli
square  where you must go if you are a chocolate lover we also rented bicycles from a little shop above ghiradelli and rode to the bridge which was amazing that golden gate bridge is just an amazing landmark the tram stops are only 5 mins walk max and that will get you everywhere you would want to go union square etc
i didnt really use the facilites as no time to swim and was too cold but the pool area looked lovely
all in all if i was going to san francisco again  i would definetley stay here without a doubt do not listen to people slating it  san francisco is about exploring not worrying about what your hotel offers and this hotel is perfect",4.0
old but not bad,very old hotel location was ok 10 minute walk to westfield shopping centre tram stop out the front cheap cab ride to all the main sights the room was average comfy bed clean but very small  basic bathroom our room had a connecting door to another room which was locked made for a fairly noisy night as i could hear our neighbours talking starbucks in the lobby is very convenient the buffet breakfast was nothing worth getting up for free wifi was a plus,3.0
great location,we came right at the beginning of the cherry blossom festival so prices in dc for lodging were astronomical this hotel felt over priced but at a regular rate i would recommend it it is not the most up to date hotel but it is clean comfortable and the location to the metro is phenomenal i would stay here again,4.0
the finest resort ever,the grand del mar was one of the nicest resorts i have ever stayed at located in a beautiful area in the hills of del mar the setting is absolutely stunning the property is is lovely the buildings well detailed and overall just impeccable when you check in the staff is friendly and professional at check in they offer you a scented towel to prepare you for your delightful stay the rooms are well appointed and beautifully sized with nice furnishings and a superb bathroom beautiful bath accessories robes room safe and lovely touches throughout the only item i thought was deficient was the shower was not very good at all low water pressure funny how a hotel with such exceptional attention to detail would overlook one of the most important functions of the day a good shower turn down service was lovely with rose petals in the bathroom and chocolates on the pillow that were always delicious the staff is fantastic they cant do enough for you and very friendly yet professional i tried the spa excellent great massage wonderful spa area steam sauna and whirlpool and wonderful amenities excellent gym with the best equipment the food on property was also excellent i cant say enough good things about the grand del mar and will definitely recommend it to everyone i know as well as come back,5.0
beware unless you love shabby rooms attitude dirt and bugs,was excited to stay since the location is fantastic walking distance to many major nyc attractions shows etc bell and restaurant staff are friendly but beware the front desk employees the website shows beautifully appointed rooms but the reality is far from the truth antiquiated air conditioners make for stifling rooms chipped bathroom tiles queensized sheets on king sized beds leave you fighting with the bottom sheet all night the lack of bathroom exhaust fans are like being in an unwanted sauna the ecologically friendly light bulbs hang below the shades are too big for the lamps and provide a blinding glare when turned on the bathrooms have dirt rimmed shower doors and dirty grout when we asked to change rooms we were rebuffed by one desk clerk finally after much hassle we did switch rooms unfortunately the only difference was a larger space but this one had an ant colony in the bathrrom,1.0
you be the judge,arrived here from out of town to celebrate 50th birthday at 400 pm our room still was not cleaned and the explanation given was that the hotel had permitted a late checkout the staff then suggested that we go grab some dinner at 430 and that we could change our clothes in the spa what we walked around for two hours waiting for housekeeping to clean the room and got soaking wet as it poured while we were out when we returned the room was ready but not what we reserved at 50 we arent into double beds after some wrangling about the reservation we were moved to a different room king size bed good but lost the view and the bathtub bad management agreed to move us again but this time across the wharf in the pouring rain to a separate building by this stage we were late for our 7pm dinner reservation no thanks we went back to the double beds which was fine but not what we had booked staff were friendly throughout but the hotel i guess got the first part wrong and it compounded from there room booked as a deluxe harbour view with uninterrupted views didnt match the online hype so not the bargain or quality we had booked,3.0
good place to stay in san diego,"my husband and i stayed in a premier room at the omni the room was spacious and very clean including the linens and matress pad prior to our stay a few requests were made and all of them were metreservations and check in were efficient the ladies at the front desk were excellent actually all the staff that we dealt with from the concierge to the valet were very professional and courteous except for 2 individuals in the housekeeping department robert and mauda 
apart from the above the only other negative was the hefty 3500 to park daily and if you wish to leave a tip for the the valetwhich at 3500day should be included you can not add it to your room charges you must pay cash which if you dont know can be an inconvenience
apart from the above our stay was very comfortable and we would stay at this omni again without hesitation",4.0
some nice features but nothing seems to work,"my wife and i stayed at the sheraton los angeles for three nights during a business trip we had been hoping that my starwood gold status would get us an upgrade to the executive level which has happened occasionally at other starwood properties but we were happy to settle for a southeastfacing corner room on the 18th floor this turned out to be a mixed blessing the room was large and looked nice enough but the view turned out to be nothing special  the massive parking garage and some uninteresting sections of south los angeles  and the two walls of windows caused the room to be unbearably hot this was exacerbated by the weak and antiquated airconditioning unlike 99 of modern hotels in which each room has its own thermostat and fan control this one only had an onoff switch and a lever that went from warm to cool we followed the advice of the hotel staff and kept the curtains closed most of the day although sitting in a dark room more or less defeats the purpose of having panoramic windows but when i tried to work at the desk near the closed curtains it still felt like i was sitting next to a heater
there were other technical problems as well the water in the shower never went beyond lukewarm and the water pressure was also very weak a hotel engineer explained that the state andor local governments had imposed low flow requirements on the shower heads and that the hot water had been restricted so that you wont scald yourself but the net result was that taking a shower was not a pleasant experience and i dont recall having had this problem in other los angeles hotels
although fixing these big problems might require a toptobottom remake of the hotel there are other problems that would be much easier to solve the only drinking glasses in our room were flimsy disposable plastic ones the towels looked like they had been purchased on a budget a few years ago there was no safe in the room 
on the good side the hotel has a great location steps from stores restaurants and downtown office buildings and quite near historic los angeles neighborhoods and attractions including the old pueblo de los angeles little tokyo and union station theres also a metro station right across the street the bed was comfortable and the large flatscreen tv was impressive and we found most staff members to be pleasant and helpful unlike some other reviewers we found the housekeeping staff to be hardworking and efficient a couple of the reception desk staff were brusque and cocky in an urban sort of way they probably didnt mean anything by it but all hotels should give frequent refresher training in the golden rule",3.0
staff very rude poor service and amenities,before booking my stay at the crown plaza i checked out their webside it said renovations were to be completed by end sept just to be sure i called the hotel and was told that everything is complete in the hotel with just some minor work outside everything was fully operational when i checked in as a platinum member of piority club normally i get some extra benefits such as an upgrade to the exec floor and complimentary breakfast i was told that this hotel does not recognise this status as it is upto the individual hotel i could not believe this as i have never had a problem anywhere else before i asked to see the manager and they were very rude and denied my requesti also discovered the resaurant was not open for dinner and the bars were also closed i was told they were waiting for a liquor licence i complained again to the front desk manager and this time they agree to give me a free breakfast it was as i was begging for it and i was made to felt bad i have read other review on different websites about this hotel and how rude the staff are they really could not care less i would not recommend staying at this hotel due to the attitude of the staff,1.0
exceptional service at an affordable price,i am completely unsavvy when it comes to new york but after visiting on business a few times i decided to surprise my wife with a valentines day trip to the city i had many questions about where and which subway station would get us to our destinations and every question was met with patience and detailed instructions which got us to our destinations easily the front desk staff was very attentive arranging dining reservations time saving recommendations and advice on how to navigate the city our room was cozy and bed was extremely comfortable,5.0
great hotel great location,we stayed here in august with friends and family i can not begin to say how perfect this hotel was for us the staff was wonderful friendly and helpful the bellhop zach i believe was not only helpful to me but also made sure to pay attention to my children which is a plus in my book he also gave us great recommendations on where to eat the hotel was within a reasonable walk to the historic area of philly and is very close to the terminal market very convenient if you need to go to the ball parks or arenas the subway station is right there across the street from the hotel it was the perfect place for a great trip,5.0
best service  definitely will return to stay,everthing from the kind hospitality right up to the guidance provided by the hotel management and staff was excellent,5.0
review of hilton mahattan east hotel in nyc,"stay period  feb 24 to feb 26
1 location  middle town near grand central station from grand central station walk to hilton manhattan east hotel take 7 to 10 mins just a straight way its easy and not hard to found the area there is save lot of expensive shop famous building like empire state building new york public library around there and it took 10 to 15 mins or 20 mins walk to time square taxi driver have no problem to found there
2 hotel lobby  nice decorated free wifi have desk for trourist information like map guide comfortable sofa nice desk lady i had several time at midnight asking question the front desk manager men forgot the name is really helpful like asking for help how to make the free wifi working on my galaxy note where to buy cigarette
3 room  a  room is small and you can say nice the most important to me is the tv and music player my one is not ipod but the have the clock radio which can put my galaxy note to play my own music tv have not much channel but enough for a tried night when you fell very sleepy they dont have much movie channel also music channel the movie channel is amc and hbo movie was old and boring 
 b  the bed is very comfortable they have 4 pillow and its also comfortable the bed also have a long and big cushion and it occupied my bed a 13 portion so i just put it away
 c  the bathroom is dated bath tub have some dirty spot the amenities like shampoo conditioner is not really plenty and the most weird thing is they dont have hair dryer  on feb 24 friday night when i arrrived from virginia to nyc at 530pm strong wind and crazy rain make me all wet even my hair and they dont have hair dryer  and the room have coffee and tea complimentary but i cant found the water even the water bolier and there have no mini bar so i need to go to near supermarket at 3am to buy a can of beer
 d  when i want to have hair dryer i call front desk and they send me hair dryer and water within 15 mins at least i dont need to wait a long time with my wet and dirty hair and i want to sleep very much
 e  the view of the room is different from the site i saw i got a room on 1616 16f left and right side window is facing the back or roof or window of other building no city view
 f  when i asking is there any business center or the place which provide internet service and they show me the business center but charges is expensive 
 g  for sleeping the room is quiet  no noise to disturb you and there have a nice mirror which stick on the bathroom door so when you close the bathroom door the whole door mirror will be the part of the rooms wall so lucky my bed is not facing the mirror or i cant get in sleep
4 awful thing  when i come back at midnight want to go to washroom i found the washroom at lobby end the toilet bowl is full of pp and lot of tissue floor is not clean the whole washroom is very dirty how can it happen on a hilton hotel
5 front desk staff  when i want to add one more night on monday the lady of front desk help me to check price she give me a good advise that if book in the front desk they can make it for me without problem but the price is us199 not including tax and the price i booked from agoda on site is us169 so she told me book on site if want to get the same price
on the whole the staff of this hotel is friendly and helpful but some facilities like the lobby washroom is awful the room should be get everything really before the tourist move in the bathroom is look very nice little bit older and the bath tub look not really decent i think hair dryer is the must have item in the bathroom the advantage of the room is lot of adapter for charging so i can charge my camera and galaxy note
totally this hotel not bad for the price us169 from feb 24 to 26 but now i checked it already turn to us299 i wont move in for this price lot of choice",3.0
huge hilton in central location,"hotel is huge at nearly 20 per day parking is rather expensive considering the hotel is not downtown the location is central to much of dallas but not near any attractions in particular so a rental car is a must
there are two or three connected buildings that make up the hotel and the rooms are different when checking in go to the tower side so that you get a tower room they are much more modern than the atrium side if you check in at the atrium side you are likely to get an atrium room which is a basic hilton room showing a bit of age it seems strange that there would be such a difference in the hotel rooms but the hotel has something like 1700 rooms so two checkin desks is a good idea you just have to be sure to go to the one in the tower side 
overall this is a generally good hilton property it is apparently a convention hotel with most travelers on business during the week we got an unpublished fare for this hotel so the value was good overall however the parking was expensive since the hotel isnt centrally located the other hotels like the one next door have free parking so paying nearly 20 per night for selfparking seemed absurd nothing is within walking distance so a rental car is a must",5.0
great pool and happy hour but no free internet,"the rooms lobby and service were all very nice and comparable to other marriott hotels ive stayed at around california we had no problem checkingin or with parking we had one problem a concierge told us breakfast was free when its not but that was quickly resolved by marriott
the pool area is very nice although the pools not heated there is a spa sauna and very wellequipped weight room plus there are free hammocks and these round couches were you can lay out in comfort and relax theres also a poolside cabana thats available to be rented 
one unexpected plus was the happy hour which ran for 5 hours 3 in the afternoon 2 at night and had 5 drinks and certain 5 menu items which was great for a cheaper late night snack
the hotel location was also nice close to major freeways and several mallsrestaurant locations
the only downside was the internet most hotels now have free wifi but the hotel charged to use the internet we paid 595 and once we logged off could not access the unused minutes wo paying another 595",4.0
great beds and pillows friendly and efficient registration,greektown hotel is a great place to stay especially if you are attending a sporting event or show in detroit  it is in walking distance of two stadiums and connected by the people mover to other places of interest greektown has many adjacent restaurants that accept casino comps and there is a free shuttle available to farther spots i has especially helpful and profeesional help from linda at reservations the last two times i stayed there the beds and pillows are the best around,5.0
great location  rather expensive,hotel appeared to be very new with everything in excellent condition the room was a comfortable size with good facilities breakfast is expensive at 17 but there are so many little diners round the corner on 6th avenue with breakast at less than 5 found it expensive at 360night expedia but the location made it worth it it is a short walk to times square and the theatres or to the subway we looked at the lineup for halfprice theatre seats and decided our time was more valuable so we went directly to the theatres they are all within a a short walk form times square and got good seats for 3 shows paying between 50  100 a must do is the gray line bus tour  they have a package of 4 tours for 54  and they are wonderful with great guides we did all 4 and saw most of manhattan brooklyn statue of liberty ferry included and a night tour ive been to many large cities and found this subway one of the harder ones to navigate but people are very helpful and offered assistance whenever we looked confused  it was fun and you cant get lost taxi from the airport is probably a ripoff at 50 and the 15 minute buggy ride in central park at 40 definitely is as for eating  we went to one of the many irish pubs just before the shows and had great food for 1520 empire state building is a must but the rockefeller centre isnt walked over brooklyn bridge for that great view overall new york is fascinating and the hilton garden inn is a great central location for seeing it,4.0
hotel was a tonic for tired travellers,"we stayed here for the first night of our holiday in california arriving jet lagged and tired the first impression the hotel gives was a tonic and it was followed up by friendly desk staff and an impressive room with 2 enormous comfortable beds the bathroom was a great size we had a fantastic view of downtown from the floor to ceiling windows and we all spent a large proportion of the night enjoying this as our body clocks were still on gmt
i appreciated the extra touches in the bathroom such as good lighting and mirrors and lots of soap shampoos and conditioners there were lots of fluffy white towels for the 4 of us to use
we stayed one night and did not use any of the other hotel facilities we found it was within walking distance of some shops for the provisions that we needed and we were given a local map and clear instructions by the front of house staff
next morning we walked to catch the amtrak service to santa barbara and must recommend union station to all travellers it is a fantastic building and worth a detour if you are in los angeles",5.0
worst service  mgmt was better as the pointe,this resort used to be dedicated to luxury at a reasonable price with great service since their change to arizona grand the quality overall has deteriorated the service is terrible and the management is pathetic,1.0
really great comfortable hotel nice location,my family and i stayed in this hotel for a week and loved it we were in a suite and the room quality gym accessibility closeness to the metrotrolley stops and being close to gaslamp and other attractions were all big pluses too the staff was really friendly and helpful and it was an overall great stay would recommend to anyone,5.0
first impression changed by superior service,"im generally not that picky about rooms when i travel by myself to me on this trip being within visual distance of the ocean was more important than the room and amenities my only request i made through the wyndam rewards website was not to put me on the first floor
i arrived an hour before check in time and the front desk hostess promptly checked me in anyway
i was put on the first floor room 106 i was surprised that this room was even available given that the room across from me was partially demolished the lower half of the walls in the hallway had drywall removed with exposed studs and the carpet in the hall and up to my door was covered with cardboard ducttaped to the walls and threshold my balconypatio opened up to a lovely ground level view of the parking lot
i was pretty much in disbelief at the whole situation
i approached the hostess melissa i think and asked for a different room she was very accommodating and immediately found an upper level room 352 which was an upgrade for me at no additional cost she saved the day
the rest of the staff were uniformly friendly and personable including housekeeping
the partial view rooms are exactly that i was able to watch the sunset and see the ocean waves by sitting cattycorner on my balcony and looking between the buildings
the tropical decor wasnt something id choose the inside chairs were stiff and uncomfortable there were 2 paintings of the same thing but there were little things that i could really appreciate oxygenics shower head with outstanding pressure bottle opener in the bathroom extra pillows bottled water ironing board plenty of hand towels decent coffee there were a few minor annoyances roof construction next door the door lock wasnt responsive the tv remote buttons were sticky but it was a quiet spacious and comfortable room
the pool was a little crowded and felt a bit enclosed due to the glass windbreaks but appeared well maintained parking was 15day there is an excellent and popular beachfront restaurant world famous across the parking lot with very reasonable prices that i ate breakfast at twice 
the boardwalk spans several miles back and forth and gave me about an hour of brisk exercise daily the sunsets were stunning mission beach was clean and there are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby
i would stay at this hotel again but probably not for a special event like an anniversary i felt like all the provisions i needed were there it was weathered but clean and the staff warmed the place up overall a nice hasslefree experience and i enjoyed myself",4.0
excellent hotel however im not going back ever again,"the hotel is great the room was big staff friendly and we slept great on the week days however during the weekend it felt like a cheap vegas hotel very very noisy on friday night someone pulled the fire alarm at 3am and the entire hotel was awake needless to say we were up since than saturday night there was a party in a room nearby and we were up again for the entire night the staff offered a breakfast in return for 2 sleepless nights which was insulting
im never going back there",3.0
would stay here again  location friendly service walkable area,"the westin was a great place to spend six nights not far from the metro about a half mile from the convention center dupont circle a walkable distance although there is a bit of a hill the national mall is close about 10 minutes away
the room was very comfortable felt like a home away from home without a kitchen having a refrigerator in the room was a treat there isnt a view the bed was very comfortable the room was roomy the maid service was very good i liked the option of foregoing maid service for the 500 credit
there is a concierge on duty into the night time  a treat since i was in meetings from 800 am until 630 pm kudos for recommending the martin luther king jr monument  if i hadnt been tired after 4 days of meeting with sore feet and just too tired i would have gone both concierges that helped me did more than hand out a map and point
the front desk was attentive the bellmen were very nice the neighborhood has restaurants in all price ranges the refrigerator allowed making purchases at local grocery stores for breakfast yogurt and muselix
the convention rate was reasonable for dc",4.0
good location and value,"we stayed for 5 nights in a double room with shared bath
location was great a couple of minutes walk from a metro stop down a quietish street but safe the shared bathroom was clean and almost always available if youre looking for a budget hotel within easy travel of all major sights then you could do a lot worse",4.0
simple crash pad with stable rates,"i am an exlong time nyer who stays overnight 1012 times a year while doing things i used to do when i lived there i have become a big fan of the jane because of its consistency and simplicity i just need a place to sleep overnight the jane offers a comfortable single bed with free wireless internet a free bottle of water and rates that never seem to vary between 79 and 99 dollars a night in my at least 10 stays there all weekend i have never encountered a problem in the shared bathroom  ive barely seen anyone else and when i do they are as silent and going about their business as i am 
i know theyve opened a trendy bar downstairs but i have yet to encounter the result of that  i must get in for the night too early or something but i have never heard anything i wish they had regular elevators but i dont mind walking and the elevator operators are also de facto customer service  once i bought a good night beer that required an opener and the elevator operator happily accommodated me and another time my key stopped working which made me really grumpy but the elevator operator was able to fix the problem without a visit to the front desk 
really for me it is a crash pad in the city without the hassle of having to set up arrangements with a friend andas a bonus there is an affordable car lot across the street but i have also found free parking on the street on many occasions dont listen to the front desk guy who is nice but uninformed about the parking situation as i was when i lived therefollow the street signs which mostly indicate free parking",4.0
very excited to stay here,"not a review yet since we still have to arrive but since we will be arriving here this thursday coming in from holland to stay for 6 nights just a short note to say that we are very much looking forward to it after having read all this reviews we booked the hotel due to the reviews here for my birthday which was this sunday and are happy to see that it is still going strong especially since it is our first visit
so jennifer and all here we come to enjoy ourselves and will defenitely post a review after our visit",5.0
a very nice discovery,"a very lovely hotel great location to fabulous shopping and excellent restaurants
room was very bright due to walltowall windows a stark contrast to the dimly lit hallways the room is not very large and the bathroom is somewhat on the smallish side but everything is very modern and slick the area was also remarkably quiet during the weekend it is a fair walk to the old town but access to the t is right outside the door
we went to the dipping pool on the roof this area feels a little dated and has a backyard feeling and you are certainly not going to do laps but for a break from your shopping during the day it is a lovely quiet spot for a drink and a snack even without dipping",4.0
perfect place for coming in and out of charlotte airport,"i stayed with my daughter at this hotel on the nights before and after a trip to costa rica on the way tofrom the airport 
the hotel is new and beautiful much more redolent of an omni or hilton than a hampton it is clean comfortable and even a bit chic the front desk staff was very friendly the rooms are beautiful with comfy beds and nice flat screen tvs there is a pool and hot tub which were clean and the right temperature 
there was a free 24 hour shuttle to and from the airport and indeed the same friendly driver dropped me off at 4 am and picked me up again a week later at 1215 am the only thing is that my cell phones information line didnt have the phone number of this hotel in the system yet bc it was so new so i had to call the central hampton inn line to call the shuttle when i returned to the airport it would be good to have the phone number handy you can call from the airport courtesy phone but i didnt see the phone 
the hotel stored my car for the whole week for 5 and there was security present onside and my car was fine 
there is 24 hour coffeeteahot chocolate service and i think they leave fruit out all the time there were cookies when i arrived at about 8 pm the first day but not when we got in at 1230 am understandably
the breakfast was good make your own waffles scrambled eggs etc on the day of our 4 am flight they even packed us a bag lunch
i have absolutely no complaints about this hotel and would gladly stay here again it would be great for any purpose  business leisure etc it is a perfect place to stay on the way tofrom the airport",5.0
great location,the hotel was gorgeous i could see fenway park from my window eastern standard was just down stairs its super close to bus campus ive been to a ton of hotels and this one was quite nice,5.0
hip dog friendly nice decor,i tried to think of the first three things which came to mind regarding this hotel first of all its very hiptrendy the decor is nice and even a little quirky i mean who really gets to use leopard print terrycloth robes outside of their own home the rooms are small but well appointed i was a little taken aback by the number of dogs i saw enteringstaying on the property but my fears quickly subsided    i didnt hear one bark see any fur balls or any signs of the furry critters the staff are generally nice i was really impressed to see two iced down water containers with my choice of either mintlemon or strawberry infused water gratis this is a lovely hotel although its almost impossible to get a taxi from this spot which was probably the only detractor i can come up with the hotel is very convenient to shopping and also the bart and when the going gets tough theres blue bottle cafe just around the corner eat your heart out starbucks,4.0
very nice economy accomodations,we were very pleased with our recent stay at the old town inn in san diego if you are looking for a smaller economical motel away from the bustle of motel row this is the place it was clean comfortable and reasonable the location was great if you have a car the grounds are nice with many flowers and plants the continental breakfast was slightly above average the staff very nice and accommodating we stayed in the economy wing which is an older part of the motel but it was perfectly adequate for our needs with a quiet comfortable place as our number one priority,4.0
a dumpy hotel in koreantown with only attraction is location,"i am some sort of hotelsnub and here is why i was a flight attendant for 15 years staying in the best and worst of some hotels in countries all around the world i could write a book about hotels from bed bugs to suites and from 0 starts to 5 stars hotels my experience has given me a quite range of knowledge about the industry now with my credibility built up here is what i think of the hotel stamford
location excellent steps away from great locations in manhattan such as koreantown empire state penn station manhattan mall and many others this is for the people that do not care about rooms and do care mostly about location
lobby cold feeling not temperaturewise with a very small checkin desk old and dated counters furniture and an elevator that looks that it should be in an antique museum light is very brightwhite business like and i feel like i am walking into an office building more than a hotel i guess you can claim that it adds feeling to the hotel yeah right
amenities the hotel offers free wireless in the lounge floor only between the early morning hours until 3 pm after hours the guest must pay what that is the biggest oxymoron ive heard in a long time why charge for only a few hours of the night there is a couple of computers in the business center but after i heard stories of identities being stolen from public computers i do not like to use any of them this is not a lie or urban legend story one of my friends used a computer in the business center at a very reputable hotel in lax and 24 hours later the credit card she used to pay for the charges was hacked and thousands of dollars of online purchases were charged to her credit card 
rooms all i have to say is yuk here is why the decorcolor is 60s green with super white bright lights old phones and televisions furniture was chipping away and the room just felt as cold as the lobby 
the bed spreadcover is very old i immediately take it off the bed as they are the ones to harbor bacteria and the nasty stuff you can only find with a blue light the bed was very old and could feel the metal springs on my back and was concerned if one of them will come through the fabric and poke me in the back in addition the curtains were made of the same material as the bed spread the television channel selection sucked with only a handful of local channels and a few international 
the only positive thing i have to say about the room is that it has a refrigerator in other higher quality hotels a refrigerator is a luxury item with some even adding an additional 30 or more dollars to the bill when asking for one 
the ultimate cleaning test i do is to wear clean white socks and see how they end up at the end of the evening while walking around lets say that in a mater of minutes my white socks were black i wonder when it was the last time this hotels carpets where shampooed and properly cleaned
bathroom the basics are given such as shampoo lotion and soap water pressure was good and towels ok but again old and a better cleaning detergent could have been used hairdryer did its job but was very loud everything else worked fine
wakeup call worked fine but not even a voice at the other end most hotels will have either a recording or live person give you the time and weather conditions but not here just silence
service i only had contact with the front desk staff and they seemed to be professional but along with the ambiance of the hotel cold and serious
overall experience great location but in service decor amenities and cleanliness hotel stamford failed completely hotel stamford is in need of major renovations and upkeeping better hotels for equal price in the area are available where it can be more comfortable to stay at",2.0
great deal great room great location,very comfortable room very comfortable for 3 people with the loft,5.0
how convenient,"i recently stayed at the drury inn on the riverwalk as a last minute one more night add on to our lovely san antonio vacatation here is what i found
pros
suites are great for families traveling with children bedroom seperated from living room by sliding door couch turns into an extra bed
pet friendly great to see cute dogs in the lobby 
three free drinks from 530 to 7 along with kid friendly food and snacks such as chicken fingers fresh veggies and dip baked potato etc really enjoyed being able to have a few drinks on the house great people watching opportunity 
 free breakfast buffet which was quite excellent 

hot tubs were very nice clean  not creepy at all  great rooftop poop very clean
lovely balconies in room 
new carpet and decor in the room 
cons lobby still looks like a bank although very ornate seeems like something is missing
 building a little askward to navigate in some spots still looks like and old office building from the 1960s felt ghosty not the rooms the halls",3.0
great location but rodent problem,on the surface the hotel is very beautiful it is in a great location and has nice amenities such as the spa and fitness center and a great pool the restaurant roberts has wonderful food and there are nice gift shops however my experience was not so pleasant as there was a rodent infestation at the time i was there in late summer there was a mouse in my sleeping room that fortunately was not discovered until the morning i was checking out otherwise i would have not have been able to stay in that hotel another night there was also a mouse in the main regency ballroom it was a tramatizing experience as i have never had a rodent or insect problem at any hotel ive stayed the hotel staff was quite apologetic but it was apparently a big problem i will not stay there again and even if there were no rodents i would not have recommended it,2.0
dont love the namebut the hotel is great,"recently stayed at this establishment for one night we were very pleasantly surprised to find a very nice facility with well appointed and decorated rooms the street that the hotel is on has free street parking available in the usual new york fashion you have to move your car twice during the week for one hour or so and we were able to secure a place right outside the hotel  literally 
lovely staff and an excellent espresso machine cimbali at the buffet breakfast just topped it off would return",5.0
love the building and space but ac was out,"the room size was absolutely amazing great bed as with every marriott old building with lots of character and great views from the rooftop patio the location is great and allows you to walk to a number of restaurants
two problems air conditioning was out in the lobby elevator and hallways and this during a heat wave where the heat index reached almost 120 that meant breakfast in the 90 degree great room was just not that appealing and with limited self parking i was forced to valet and the valets were very quick getting my car fine for a leisure trip not so good when youre expected in the office especially not great when you dont have anywhere cool to wait for your car
since i assume the ac was a on time issue and marriott was nice enough to credit me with bonus points id definitely stay here again",4.0
another fab hotel in the morgans hotels portfolio,our family of 5 has just returned from a 5 day stay at this modern deign led hotel which can be described as a hip urban oasis in the heart of the ubertrendy soho area in manhattan as a former hotel owneroperator it was great to stay in a relaxed and friendly hotel where the fabric of the hotel and the staff come together in harmony the fabric of the hotel is great as you would expect from this group but the staff make the difference and they were great from the bell boys to the concierge services team just to mention a few nothing seemed too much trouble for them concierge services are provided in a relaxed environment and they arranged everything from best broadway theatre tickets to exclusive sightseeing rides and airline bookings and providing very useful local tips check out the penthouse suites for views to die for rooms come with an ipad for guest use for paperless guest service directory and connecting to the electronic world for free  nice touch the gm gary thomas is a super guy and he has a great team around him we will be back soon,5.0
great inexpensive clean,"our stay at hotel adagio was great the place was very clean and the environment was very welcoming i found a very good price on hotelscom the staff were all very accomodating the hotel provided coupons for two complimentary organic beers at the cortez restaurant although the bar staff was a little snobby the beers were delicious overall pleasant stay 
 we stayed on the side that faces geary st so we could hear the clubsbars going on at night wasnt too bothersome but you could hear it definitely recommend to friends and family",5.0
phenomenal hotel,this hotel is quite amazing it has a very rich history and quite a bit of character the lobby the ballroom and restaurant are all beautiful the rooms are spacious and clean with marble floors leading into the bathroom the location is ideal just blocks from lake michigan and roughly a half a mile from magnificent mile the hotel is unique in terms of the history of the building i would highly recommend this hotel for a couples retreat or even solo as it puts you in the perfect location,5.0
outstanding  the place to stay,excellent hotel great front desk and all staff wonderful room and bed  kitchen and room service free hot bfast is very nice and free coffee all day long free shutle all over town and the location is close to everything you cannot beat this place pets welcome too,5.0
dedicated staff,during my experience at this property i saw that some outstanding staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make the stay of their guests more amenable  at the lax property in particular fabiola lopez at the brewery who is very attentive accommodating and an otherwise outstanding server  you dont encounter them often especially in los angeles she was able to provide her excellent and tailored service in both english and spanish flawlessly,5.0
my favorite hotel in nyc,i always stay at the elysee for business and personal trips to new york while the location is very convenient what really keeps me coming back is the outstanding service sometimes its the little touchs that set a hotel apart from the competition and the elysee excels in many ways the attentive staff the exceptional breakfast free internet service its all here they also have a great boardroom thats great for a small business meeting i also need to give a mention for the monkey bar which is a very cool historic bar adjacent to the elysee,5.0
wicked hotel,"just returned from 8 days staying at hotel 41 both my boyfriend and myself loved the hotel the rooms werent as small as i was expecting so that was a bonus a nice big shower and the dvdcd player were a good bonus too
the complimentary breakfast was a great starter for the day with muffins danish pastries bagels oj and coffee brilliant
as many other people have said before the hotel was very clean and the hotel staff were friendly and polite when we checked in we got our complimentary bottle of water there was also the promised aveda products left in our room and they were refilled each day we didnt get any bathrobes but it wasnt a big deal
the location of the hotel was prefect a few minutes from times square but the street the hotel was on is quietthe best of both worlds
we would definitely stay here again and have recommended it to friends who are thinking about going to ny
overall a great hotel for the price",4.0
stay anywhere else bed bugs black mold in shower mold in coffee maker,we prebooked our trip for our sons basic military graduation and were supposed to stay here from 720725 we arrived in san antonio after 2 planes and just wanted a nice shower and clean bed which neither were available here this place is disgusting stay anywhere else we stayed 1 night and even after spraying the entire room with lysol and bug spray we were eaten alive by fleasbed bugs the shower curtain was full of black mold and so horrible that showering was a chore instead of relaxing even the coffee filter was full of mold we ended up leaving and staying at econo lodge on w us 90 about 12 mile away which was clean and nice and only 5 moreday,1.0
great hotel,"i found this hotel online when looking for a good deal on a room 
the hotel was a little hard to find on getting there staff at the hotel is extremely friendly and go out of their way to help out i arrived earlier than check in time the reception staff was very helpful and gave me an early checkin rooms were fresh clean and comfortable the bathroom was spacious too
this hotel was my home away from home i will be visiting this hotel again next year",4.0
a great stay,i have stayed in many hotels in the houston area and this one was by far the best yet the management was fantastic and went out of their way to help with whatever they could i have a great stay and sleep i accidentally left several items in the room safe and when i called to notify them they had already put them aside for me to claim,5.0
very handy to everything,recently spent 3 nights here was walking distance to most things pier 39 for alcatraz hop on hop off buses supermarket bank etc had fantastic service from book in where we were booked in by a lovely australian girl who made our day very friendly and helpful rooms very comfy we had room 440 overlooking garden which was very quiet very clean and met some lovely people at coffee in morning,5.0
a few redeeming features,"externally very unattractive with poor room access due to few stairs and elevator being poorly located clientele had a bit of a shady look with a lot of open doors and partying going on the room itself was better than the exterior as a full kitchenette was provided in my 2 queen suite however maintenance was not up to par as two different lights didnt function
access to qualcomm stadium was good also there is a trolley stop a short distance away which provided good access to downtown sd and the gaslamp district free high speed internet was nice as well",2.0
what an amazing place to stay,i can not say enough about this little hotel in the heart of times square i felt that my room was very affordableat 150 a night its located just one block behind the heart of times square on 8th  48th the hotel was spotless the rooms were huge and very nice  for ny standards andi have stayed in many other hotels in nyc and this is the first hotel that had sound proof rooms i couldnt hear the street noise or even the fire department next door to top it all offid mentioned in passing that i was in town for my bday to their front desk receptionist abigail who then sent a free breakfast voucher to my room so sweet thenmy flight was cancelled out of laguardia and i was already checked out and at the airport when i found out i called the hotel  they told me to come on back  and even offered me another free breakfast because of my problem staff is top notch and the hotel is gorgeous id recommend this hotel to anyone,5.0
outstanding  and surprisingly a real value,"one up side of the down economy is that savvy travelers can enjoy some real bargains my wife and i recently took advantage of a significant deal offered by the ritzcarlton chicago the hotel was offering a credit read discount of 100 per night for guests who stayed a minimum of two nights because we planned to drive from indianapolis after work on friday anyway it was perfect the luxury of the ritzcarlton for a room rate of about 25 a night more than we would have spent on a much more modest hotel at the other end of the magnificent mile
the service was impeccable from the bellman who greeted us and took our luggage to our room to the desk clerks the concierge and room service attendants everything was topflight 
the hotel is located in water tower place kittycorner from the famous chicago water tower across from the john hancock building and adjacent to a shopping mall with the store my wife refers to as her mother ship macys try the frango mints theyre a true chicago treat
our room 2222 was a deluxe room and included a king bed easy chair desk bigscreen tv huge closet and a minibar the room faced south with what real estate agents would describe as a peek view of lake michigan and navy pier but had shades and curtains that kept the morning sun at bay until we were ready to greet it
the bath was quite large with double sinks a separate tub and toilet area generous fluffy towels a hair dryer lighted makeup mirror robes and slippers and highend loccitane en provence amenities 
lounging about in bathrobes reading the paper and sipping coffee is a great way to start the day so on saturday morning we decided to treat ourselves to room service the french country breakfast consisted of assorted cured meats and cheeses artisan bread a croissant citrus mostarda café au lait and brewed coffee it was delivered within 12 hour of our call and was delicious
thus fortified we got ready to head out onto the magnificent mile and enjoy some surprisingly glorious november weather 
after a day spent doing a little shopping and a lot of wandering through art galleries along the mag mile and in the citys river north neighborhood we were ready for a nice dinner chicago is also home to a number of wonderful dining spots many are within easy walking distance of the ritzcarlton while my wife and i thoroughly enjoy fine food and arent hesitant about paying for it some of the trendier spots in the area seemed to smack of a popularity premium so we asked one of the concierge staff for other recommendations the concierge a member of les clef dor recommended a new mexican restaurant that opened on kinzie street in september just a short cab ride from the hotel 
theres a lot to do in chicago from shopping and sightseeing when the weather is good to a broad range of museums theatres and other indoor attractions when the weather is bad i highly recommend considering the ritzcarlton as your base of operations no matter what the weather",5.0

location is brilliant,"stayed here in august a great location walking distance from all the main attractions staff were really helpful and pleasant room was small but we were aware of that on booking but it was perfect for our needs the breakfast was great nice to have coffee in the morning and it was nice and quiet tvs could do with some updating since the rooms are so nice and modern 
thanks",5.0
as nice as we remembered from our last stay,"we spent three nights at the omni it took us a couple of tries before we finally navigated the confusing streetshighways around the hotel and made it to the omni
checkin was smooth and quick the 5thfloor room was pleasant and clean the beds were comfortable a little too soft for my wifes taste but okay for me and came with tons of pillows our only complaint is that there was only a sheer curtain that covered the entire window the heavier darker drapes only covered half of the left and right sides so it wasnt possible to make the room completely dark at night parking was free which is nice
as a select guest member omnis club i got two free beverages juices coffee or tea and my choice of the wall street journal usa today or the austin paper delivered to the room for free each day bagels or croissants werent free but came at a reasonable cost with cream cheese and jam very niceif youre going to stay at this or any omni i highly recommend joining the select guest program its free
the hotel is right at the intersection of hwy 71 and interstate 35 so it was a convenient location for travelling to other parts of the city not as closein as a downtown hotel but we had business south of town in addition to seeing friends in austin so for us it worked out great we didnt try the hotel restaurant or use the pool so i cant comment on those
all in all a nice place wed be happy to stay here again the next time were in austin especially at the low low price we got via priceline",4.0
great location,"the hotel was clean and quiet which is very important to me the hotel is in the perfect location for downtown activities and 6th street i am with another review i had trouble finding outlets to plug things into but not a biggie 
my only complaint is that for a 4 star hotel there were no services for that 4 star price i would at least expect coffee in the lobbythat is a standard in the industry these days there was coffee but you had to pay for it  starbucks",4.0
nice quirky hotel definitely not a runofthemillhotel,"my husband and i spent our 10th anniversary here just for a short overnight very modern popart decored hotel its not my favorite atmosphere but because its unique its memorable so im pretty sure that 10 years from now ill remember this place vs a lot of other hotels we stay in for one reason or another that run right into the next one 
service is fantastic very very nice the first employee we ran into took complete care of us and said i will be your best friend we arrived just in time for the winebeer hour which is a nice touch when we arrived back from dinner someone had delivered fruit and a bottle of champagne to our room neither of us requested this but they did it for our anniversary
valet is 40 so be prepared although its a one time charge you can get your car out as much as you want without additional charges 
the room was decently sized i think also because the furniture is modern it takes up less room than normal bulky full sized dressers and tables bathroom is small but didnt really matter to us we didnt spend a ton of time in there there were 3 narrow floor to ceiling mirror panels in the main part of the room im sure to give the impression of a larger room but im not a fan of staring at myself while watching tv that said if you love you by all means youll love the mirrors the bed and pillows were very comfortable all in all we really enjoyed our stay but because we like to try different places well probably try another kimpton hotel",4.0
great staff and great location,we recently stayed at the hotel handlery in san francisco for two nights while celebrating our 40th anniversary the staff was excellent from checking to checkout the hotel s in a great location with easy access to the cable cars ad the trolleys our room was exceptionally clean and for a downtown hotel very roomy the concierge was very helpful with suggestions for sights ad restaurants and the front desk help was a pleasure to deal with we were 2 couples both celebrating our 40th anniversaries and this was the sat leg of a 10 day trip that began in san diego we ad entwined our anniversary and the hotel sent a battle of champagne to each room nice touch we all highly recommend this hotel it was difficult to leave this hotel and city and return to boston,5.0
first trip to nyc found the perfect place to stay,this hotel was located in a nice area was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful,5.0
small rooms poor service old tv weird decor,"booked on priceline stayed 2 nights
first impression decor would be more appropriate for a seaside resort the room was barely big enough to fit a small bed full size and a desk with one chair the tv was probably 15 years old and didnt have very good picture quality i have better at home with basic cable small hallways had to elevator down 12 floors to get ice key cards worked about every fifth try maybe there is a trick they havent shared with us
next day my wife and i passed on cleaning since we hadnt mangled the room much but the second evening when we arrived back at the room and were watching some tv we noticed a bunch of long black hair on the bed not ours also found an yelloworange something smeared on a blanket i called the desk to ask that our linens be turned as we were leaving for the evening and they said that wouldnt be a problem returned to find someone had left 2 folded sheets for us laying on the dirty bed no pillow cases no new blanket",2.0
this hotel has no class it failed to honour a confirmed reservation,"i had a confirmed reservation with this hotel guaranteed for late checkin i arrived at around 10pm after a long flight the front desk staff informed me that the hotel was full but they would be delighted to offer me a conference room to sleep in with a rollaway bed 
my thoughts is this some kind of f joke
the appropriately stressed front desk manager eventually got me and my colleague in the comfort inn which wasnt bad actually
the only positive to come out of this was the attempts by the neutered frontdesk staff to make a bad situation slightly better we got free food and taxi to the comfort inn
i had a contract with the hyatt and as far as i am concerned they broke that contract i am very sure that hyatt will find some sort of legal loophole to minimise the responsibility that they should take for this kind of behaviour but in my opinion they broke the spirit of the contract between a customer and the hotel i will not use hyatt hotels again",1.0
first and last time trying this hotel,"we stayed two nights here mostly for its good location to the airport and downtown it is an old hotel which isnt a problem in itself if it is kept up checking in was easy the room was average and relatively clean the bath grout could use better cleaning the beds were comfortable enough and the pillows good there are only two floors to the hotel so the first floor windows face the parking lot  not so great and the second floor windows face a fire station across the street  not so great when they get calls in the middle of the night the hotel is next to the freeway making it easy to get where youre going and super close the the airport
the toilet in our bathroom kept running after flushing since it had taken so long earlier in the day to ask a question at the front counter no one was around i decided it would be quicker to try and fix it myself than call and wait i stuck my arm into the tank and rehooked the plastic chain that had come off because it was too short luckily i know how to do this but some people might not anyway who wants to stick their arm in a hotel toilet tank anyway definitely not the highlight of our stay should have gotten a discount for fixing their toilet 
they offer a full breakfast but be sure you are there first thing in the morning once they run out of something if there is less than an hour remaining for breakfast which ends at 10 am they will not make more both mornings we arrived for breakfast at 930 am one morning they were out of bacon but would not make more  were closing soon and the second morning they were out of biscuits  same excuse we cant make more were closing soon in fact they dont wait until 10am to close they start packing it all up at 940 i told my son to run up to the counter and grab what he might want because they were putting everything away 20 minutes earlier than we expected we ate our breakfast while the hotel staff wiped tables and threw away trash around us not very appetiting
the second morning they were also out of milk so he couldnt have cereal no biscuits no cereal he had a banana and toast the first morning we asked if there were more bananas they brought out more but all were covered with black spots  too ripe the second morning the bananas were better the woman working the breakfast bar was not friendly and a bit short when we asked about replenishing the empty trays
the lobby computer worked fine in room i could use my ipad then printed out boarding passes in the lobby no problem there
we got a note in our room that there were a slew of car breakins in the area so that wasnt particuarly reassuring but we never leave valuables in our car anyway",1.0
truly one of the greatest hotels ive ever stayed at,"i wanted to take my adult son on a great thanksgiving long weekend and spent more than i usually do to stay at the edgewater i must say i think it was totally worth it i told son that we both need to find someone to love and bring them back here cause it would be an incredible place to stay if one were in love our room 244 overlooked the water 
and you could open the slider and lean on the railing there are mugs in the giftshop picturing the beatles fishing out of one of the rooms
 the sea gulls fly around outside your window and the duckies do their thing and you occasionally see a ferry boat or big sport boat out on the water sounds of the harbor are distant and add to the ambience 
 from our room you could see the lit ferris wheel the first night we were at the hotel we got in very late almost 11 and they were very nice in the bar and let us order some outstanding fish  chips didnt rush us at all great views from the bar and seasonally you could eat out on their deck
the room had a charming functional gas fireplace we loved the beautiful though small bathroom we both would have liked to have a bathtub beside the shower but its a very nice shower and the room is worth it both thought bathroom needs a fan
two comfy chairs by the fireplace but would be very very nice to have a small table for drinks andor coffee by the fire one can always unfold a luggage stand and put a hardcover city travel book on top and make ones own table but this is a tiny element that should be corrected in my view
you can walk to space needle dale chihuly museum next door to that and pacific museum after that you can walk to many good restaurants anthonys i love and 
many bars and areas walk to the famous market area
parking is overpriced and only valet 38 a day but you can take your car out as many times as you want during the day
the staff is outstanding and gracious and not overly friendly just genuine friendliness my son left a cashmere cap in the lobby one day it was found i left my coat in the bar the last evening and it was found 
this is a place to make a wonderful memory and im sure my son will remember it long after im gone",5.0
will return ,"we stayed here for one night on 103111 the checkin process was very quick and the staff was friendly one of the biggest perks of this location is the free parking this is a rare find in la and very much appreciated you cant beat the location in close proximity to a variety of places to see in la if youre the walking typemany places to get to by foot if you feel like venturing further the subway is a close walk as well we decided to take the car to west hollywood for the halloween carnival aside from the regular la traffic it was a quick ride upon returning later that evening there were plenty of parking spaces still available 
the morning we departed we decided to hikerun runyon canyon the hotel staff was kind enough to give us a late checkout so after we hiked we were able to return and shower we really appreciated their flexibility 
the rooms were clean the usual wear and tear but nothing gross we had a room at the farthest end from the street so noise wasnt a problem shower worked nicely and the fridgemicrowave were nice to have available 
this hotel has pretty much all the things you need when staying in hollywood proximity to attractions very close to universal studios hollywood bowl hollywood blvd the free parking is a big deal trust me and a clean place to stay while exploring la i have also stayed at the days inn on sunset blvd and would prefer this best western cleaner and smells much better plenty of options to eat at nearby as well there are also cvsfresh and easy stores nearby so if you want to stock your fridge i would definitely stay hereand hopefully will be sooner than later enjoy",4.0
great downtown location,i cant comment on the value of the hotel as i was staying there on a discount program the rooms that my party had reserved were a bit small but they were meant for a maximum of 2 guests in each room the views from the 20th floor were beautiful of the mountains and downtown the staff was wonderful and courteous i would definitely stay at the comfort inn downtown on my next visit to denver,5.0
funky  fun but inconsistent service,"my husband and i just stayed at hotel icon for 4 nights midweek we booked through the microsoft worldwide partner conference site since it was one of the conference hotels and had such good ratings on tripadvisor 
we generally prefer the individuality and funkiness of boutique hotels over large chains and the hotel icon delivered with a great deal of charm by modern standards some might consider the decor garish but we thought the blending of victorian and modern was fun and interesting 
the 2 breakfasts that we had we good  especially the icon breakfast in the dining room the wireless connectivity was good too  this can sometimes be an issue with so many conference attendees on at the same time comfy bed and wellappointed bedroom and bath too
our only complaint was the spotty service the staff was friendly and helpful but  on our last night there when we had a 550 am plane to catch  our wakeup call and our town car never materialized wed talked to the bell captain about this the night before tipped him and assumed that it was taken care of luckily we had enough reason to doubt from several other issues with the front desk and room service in particular that we set our alarm and went down to the front desk to check on the car they were able to get a cab quickly the bell captain recommmended a town car because the cabs here are unreliable",4.0
amazing customer service,"my wife and i celebrated our honeymoon in dc yes we are nerds we reserved our room through the hilton website and are hilton honors members i requested a room with a view and the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a view of the washington monument in addition the staff went out of their way to advise us on places to eat and visit despite the fact they were not a concierge in fact it was raining and we could not get a cab so a staff member went out into the rain to hail us a cab then she went to get an umbrella to loan us 
the hotel is not a luxury brand but the rooms are modern with comfortable beds spacious and clean they do have in room air conditioners which make noise but should only bother light sleepers the breakfast is the best of any hampton inn ive stayed and in the evening at 6 pm they serve fresh cookies coffee and lemonade 
last the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the washington mall it is a block from chinatown the verizon center and a diverse group of both upscale and affordable restaurants 
we were able to get a low rate by reserving our room under a hilton special offer so if you are planning a trip to dc i definently recommend this hotel there is a 34day parking fee but this is common in dc in addition i think you can park your car for a cheaper rate nearby many of the lots were fenced off this hotel is worth every penny",5.0
conflicted feelings about this hotel,"i recently attended a conference at this hotel and stayed for 3 nights overall i enjoyed my stay but the service was very inconsistent and if i had been paying to stay there myself i probably would have felt much less satisfied
as others have commented the staff seems totally indifferent to you from the minute you arrive my colleague and i took a cab from the airport and the valets and doormen didnt even acknowledge us finally another gentleman who was a considerable distance away from our cab came over to greet us and ask if we needed help later i found the restaurant and room service staff to be very friendly and attentive not sure why the service aspect of this hotel is so inconsistent
when we went to check in i was completely ignored in the marriott rewards line too  even though there was no one ahead of me finally a desk person asked if i needed help and while i had requested a nonsmoking king she said they had a much nicer double that she wanted to offer me because i am a rewards member
my room was in the older historic section of the hotel it was very spacious with large windows and a huge walkin closet the flat screen tv had video inputs if you wanted to use your computer to stream video and even though i had to pay for wireless i had no connection problems and it was very fast there was a small refrigerator that i used to store water and snacks the prices to eat inside the hotel are pretty steep my room was very quiet and while the bed was sort of small and the blanket pretty thin it was comfortable and i slept well
on the down side the furniture and carpet was sort of shabby and because the heating system hasnt been updated the bathroom was really cold the lobby in the older section appears to be completely unheated there was no way to use the space and even walking through it to get to the newer section was very uncomfortable
 the location is absolutely terrific the metro station is right outside the older section and there are lots of great places to eat nearby 
truthfully i think there are other great places to stay in dc and this property is probably best suited for large conference attendees i have enjoyed staying at the renaissance mayflower and the westin on m street must better",3.0
service was very disappointing at this hotel,"front desk staff were not helpful at all at this hotel a simple request of adjoining rooms could not be accommodated of course our travel package was to blame apparently even after offering to pay more nothing could be done  the front desk seemed offended that i asked them to call our airport transport as they were late nothing was easy
breakfast staff were rude midway through pouring coffee waitress decides her boss is more important to serve than us the best thing about this hotel was the cleaning staff they were happy and cheerful everytime we saw them couldnt wait to leave",2.0
quarters were delightful at the club,"my boyfriend and i stayed in this charming upscale and suprisingly low priced hotel december 2729 of 2004 for a holiday getaway the lobby was a cozy living room with a fireplace and lush couches and armchairs overhead the lobbys ceiling was tall and the peaked windows of the roof gave light to the citys most recognisable points in the city skyline check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly 
contrary to other reviews our room was spacious and the ceiling was nearly 15 feet high making the room seem bigger than its already comfortable size the window stretched to the top and gave us a wonderful view of philadelphias riverside the decorations in the room were tasteful and the wood work was done in deep chestnut place a few candles on the many bookshelves and the room became quite romantic 
our room besides the round table desk and cooking area offered up a couch nightstands and full sized mirrors the bed was so soft that we sank into it at night and there was no noise granted we were on the 11th floor but it was nice to have a quiet room in the city like we were area attractions are very close by within walking distance for sure 
the bathroom was perfect in size no complaints here it had extra shelves to put your things which is always appreciated upstairs were two closets for you to get your own extras like coffee grounds for your inroom coffee pot pillows blankets even shower caps also the 12th floor hosted a well equipt excercise room with tvs
i could gush forever about how much of an excellent value the place was but why should i go get a gander for yourself you will not regret it",5.0
ok but needs updating,i understand why the mixed reviews here we had a garden view room but was upgraded to a bay front suite very happy for that or i would have been writing one of those bad reviews our unit did need some upgrades  the whole place needs it but the location made all the difference in the world being an owner of 3 units at the maui eldorado resort the comparison gave me a good feeling about our staff and property when i checked in i was not given any details of the resort had to figure it out on my own the maids did a wonderful job working with what they had the run down unit over all its all about location location location if i were to stay there again i would make sure i got a unit with the bay view on the side that does not have the pubic beach on it,3.0
nice rooms comfortable stay,we have stayed at the sister property the pointe at tapatio cliffs for several years in a row and really love it there this was our first visit at squaw peak very similiar rooms hotel lobby and adult pool area which were all very nice we chose to use the adult pool area near the lobby which is nice and quiet and features padded pool loungers the lazy river and pools nearby need some serious updating customer service here was superb just like at taptatio cliffs,3.0
had a great stay,"we had tickets to the chargersrams game on sunday arrived saturday afternoon and had no problems checking in the room is nice size and the beds were comfortable the staff is very pleasant we had great service in the on site restaurant thanks jessica be aware if going to qualcomm stadium you still need to leave at least 2 to 3 hours before game time to get in the parking lot it is a zoo we did run into some charger players at our hotel who were all very polite my son used the pool on saturday and sunday and practically had it to himself both days there is also a jacuzzi
there are plenty of places to eat nearby and the location is right off the freeway our room was on the freeway side and we were not bothered by noise at all parking was no problem i would definately stay there again",4.0
once was enough,cool place but a little too high priced for what you got would rather spend the same  or a little more and stay at the ritz or satai,3.0
unexpectantly bad service,"zee had a lot of fun at the pool however when we first arrived we had reserved a king balcony suite and when we walked in we had two double beds and the too
smelled awful like cigarettes we alled the front desk and they said the only thing they could do was spray the room they were fully committed then we decided we wanted to stay late so we paid for a half day which was not cheap so we could hang out at the pool that was a lot of fun then we got back in the room to get ready and they walked in on us twice both times we were not dressed and getting ready we were supposed to check out at 3pm and they first walked in at 2 and then at 230 they had been knocking on our door and walking in all morning there is zero communication at this hotel im highly disappointed i usually love the hotel and service hopefully this was just a bad day or maybe they should hire employees with intelligence and maybe actually consume food occasionally",2.0

glamorous boutique hotel great service top location,you can spend a lot of money on a hotel that cliams to be an unber cool boutique hotel in downtown manhattan and be very disappointed whilst 60 thompson is not cheap you do get good value we booked ahead of time and got a deal on a room that was much bigger than the normal shoe box you get in major cities the decor is very cool and up to the minute big bathroom with delicious products great food from room service impeccable service from the staff the big selling point in the summer is the stunning roof terrace bar which is very comfortable intimate and has amazing views of the manhattan skyline the hotel is in a fantatstic location a couple of blocks from broadway in the heart of the lively soho district,5.0
great choice,we arrived at the bristol hotel in the wee hours of the morning due to airline cancellations and delays and also had no luggage the night concierge was very sympathetic and kindly provided us with toothbrushes and toothpaste our room was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable the day concierge recommended some restaurants in the vicinity and after walking around and exploring we found that we were in an area surrounded by restaurants and shops the hotel was within a very short walk to the horton plaza shopping mall and a short drive to coronado island we would certainly stay here again,5.0
dont be scared off by the reservations process,i was on a business trip to dc and the washington court hotel was recommended to me due to its proximity to my meeting i was travelling and temporarily without internet at the time so i called the hotel to make my reservation it was a nightmare i was cut off three times put on hold for 10 minutes belittled etc i didnt have high expectations going into my stay but i didnt have time or energy to search for another hotel that said from the moment i arrived at the hotel the service was spot on the room was spacious and extremely comfortable and all amenities were provided for i would choose the hotel again at any time,4.0
excellent locations and even better price,after searching for weeks for a hotel i could afford for my first trip to the city i had all but given up when i came across the astor for only 55 dollars a night i was weary of the quality or location of the hotel because it was so cheap but it was perfect the room was small but perfect for me and my boyfriend we even had a veiw of the park which was directly across the street and of the city though it was far away it was a nice quit snowy couple of nights there are some good places to eat right arounfd the corner too im going back this december and weve booked this hotel again,5.0
like being in tuscany for a night,my husband and i live in tempe only about 20 minutes from this resort but it felt like we were a million miles away this resort is so beautiful as soon as you walk on the property you instinctively take a deep breathe and relax we had one of the alvadora spa rooms and it was beautiful i was amazed at the tiny details that they made special like organic coffee in the rooms and bottles of water with turndown every piece of furniture painting even the coffee condiment box in the room were obviously carefully thought about and perfect for the decor and ambiance the staff where wonderful and friendly we had breakfast at t cooks the eggs benedict and the biscuits and gravy and everything was fantastic it was a wonderful escape from everyday life with two toddlers we dont get away like this often and this was the perfect night off i would absolutely go here again hopefully for longer next time,5.0

great food great service great hotel welcome to boston,my wife and just stayed at the ames and loved it i admit i was unfamiliar with the property when we booked it through hotwire but our feelings went from apprehensive to ecstatic the more we read prior to the visit i had emailed the hotel to ensure we were getting a king bed as one of our goals was getting a good night sleep we have a toddler at home and another coming soon the concierge emailed me back to see if there was anything else they could do to make our stay special the gesture was much appreciated as was the upgrade to a suite when we checked in the room was fantastic with a large sitting and dining area adjacent to the bedroom and bathroom the color scheme was white with modern décor definitely a contrast from other hotels where weve stayed in boston the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very chic note that if you are looking to take a bath you may be out of luck as our room only had a standup shower  not sure if any other rooms have a tub the room was matched by the food from the restaurant woodward our quick lunch of squash flatbread and mixed nuts hit the spot and i sampled some of their funky cocktails the new orleans sazerac is addictive but we were holding out for breakfast and the hash menu we had the duck and sweet potato hash and the ham and cheese omelet delivered to the room and it did not disappoint overall it was a wonderful experience although we booked it at a discounted rate i would stay there at the regular rate any time,5.0

deserves the title of western white house,"this hotel was fabulous im a fan of the hyatt chain and have stayed at many of their hotels but this one is noteworthy
as an architecture buff the design by minoru yamasaki is fabulous yamasaki was also the architect of the world trade centre in new york
the staff is great you truly do feel like a hollywood star or a head of state when visiting the hyatt century plaza
the valet and doorman were perfect in their roles they seemed plucked from a time gone by
the rooms were great the staff was phenomenal and the history of the hotel is great
the hotel is fondly referred to as the western white house as it was president reagans preferred hotel in california it deserves its title to this day
a note of caution though if you are attending a conference at the la convention centre and this is a conference hotel it is about a 45 minute bus ride away",5.0
good location and good service,"the rooms are relatively spacious for new york its a great location within walking distance of times square and grand central stationthe hotel has a bar and a restaurant in the ground floor but didnt try either so cant comment on the quality of both my room on the 11th floor came with free wifi and the usual amenities of mini bar usual new york pricing though safe iron and ironing board temperature control shower with attached bath flat screen tv free paper in the morning usa today and writing desk access to your floor on the lift is via your key card so the safety aspects are taken care my flight was at 11pm so i needed to check out before noon but the hotel stored my luggage till i came back to collect
positivesgreat service specially from the front desk staff and doormen great lobby area with a pool table and lounge off to the side convenient location fast check in and check out
negatives the room i stayed in could use an upgrade of a few of the fixtures the hanger holding up the ironing board was broken would have been useful if the minibar had an icemaker",4.0
great place,"we spent march break in washington dc and use the holiday inn express as our home base perfect breakfast was included the hotel had a suttle bus to take you to union station a tip on the shuttle book your spots as soon as you check in its a busy shuttle if the time you want is full you can ask the front desk to check with the marriotts shuttle to see if they have space
pool was great and open till 10 pm
the hotel seemed to have a couple bus loads of students pass through but that wasnt a problem at all",4.0
beautiful hotel  service is amazing,"from the moment i arrived the valet was so friendly and professional he introduced himself to my husband and shook his hand  which was so refreshing he kept our car parked out front since we were just going to check in we were very early so assumed we wouldnt get a room and come back out the front desk is obviously a bit hidden but he gave wonderful directions to get to it otherwise i definitely would have felt lost
when we arrived at the front desk crystal was so friendly greeted us with a smile immediately upon turning the corner she gave wonderful explanations of all the amenities and where everything is and was just so nice
our room was amazing the cleanliness was perfect which was much appreciated after our previous hotel i just love the entire theme of the property everything is just so glamorous and beautiful 
we went to the pool just to look on our way to dinner and were in jeans and obviously not pool attire normally pool attendants wont pay you much attention unless you are in a swimsuit or pool clothing the gentlemen out there greeted us and engaged us asking how long we were staying what our plans were for the area and invited us to sit at the bar for a drink honestly i would not have been upset if they had just smiled and said hello  wasnt expecting more than that they definitely exceeded my expectations out there  they obviously really know how to connect with people and live it every day
we also went to tres for a drink before heading out to dinner and the service was just as phenomenal usually the 3 meal restaurant can be forgotten if you have a signature restaurant like bazaar but that was completely not the case here our server was engaging talked to us for a while about the restaurant and bazaar and how much he loves working there 
we didnt need luggage assistance but were in the elevator a couple times with the attendants and they were very friendly as well  asking us how our stay was and if we needed anything etc
we didnt go to bazaar i know im regretting it now but walked in to look around the greeters were so friendly told us to walk around and look and even talked to us about the restaurant  and we made it clear we were not eating there again would have been perfectly acceptable for them to not engage us at all but they did another exceeds expectations 
one thing that stood out to not just myself but to my husband was how excited everyone was to work there and about the property associates engaged us everywhere we went to talk about the property and all the little decorations and such around us  and they were so knowledgeable
overall i would stay here every time i am in the area it is worth every dollar spent  such a unique experience",5.0
great location reasonable price friendly staff stylish rooms,we had a great experience at the chandler inn we were welcomed by a friendly frontdesk staff and were even able to get into our room a little earlier than checkin time which was a welcome surprise after a day of airports and air travel we stayed in a queen boutique room which had a lot of great design detailsbrushed stainless steel ice bucket bentwood tray chilewichlike pillows and a flatscreen tv we opted to add a tiny fridge to our room for a reasonable daily charge which was a great amenity to have available on either side of the bed there were nightstands with two large roomy drawers if you chose to move out of your suitcase the location was fantasticvery close to the back bay t stop nice neighborhood to walk around in felt very safe we would highly recommend the chandler inn as a place to stay on your next trip to boston,5.0

amazing start to honeymoon,"a huge thanks to wes and all at the chancellor for an amazing start to our honeymoon i would recommend this hotel without hesitation we were in regular contact with wes before our stay no question too much and he gave us some great tips including a visit to the gold dust bar where i believe we made many new friends a great night 
we found the hotel easily parked up dropped the cases off then went round to the organised parking it was a breeze 
on arrival we discovered that wes had organised a top floor suite for us there was champagne on ice and a card and gift from the hotel team we felt so special and welcome 
during our travels around california we discovered many people who knew of the chancellor and were big fans too we definitely know why its friendly quirky and perfectly placed we fell in love with san fransisco and the chancellor was responsible",5.0
a memorable bday  thanks westin times square,"i recently celebrated my nonleap year birthday at the westin times square wow this hotel went out of its way first they gave me a corner deluxe room i had paid for an upper floor prepaid room but did not expect a corner room with fantastic views of the theatre district  the hudson plus a sliver of the upper portion of the empire state building on the 42nd floor
additionally they sent a special birthday cake most delicious surrounded by strawberries and blueberries to my room while i was at the theatre there was also a signed card i really appreciate the kind and thoughtful gesture i am not a westin big spender and i just did not expect this
the room had a wraparound view as noted and there was a nice hudson view from the bathroom as well others have commented on the lack of shelf space but this was not a problem for me there was a mobile etegere for additional storage which should accommodate most guests toiletries
i loved the fast efficient checkin please take note hilton times square no lines and i checked in at 3pm this was a pleasant stay and then some i shall remember to stay here again great location too  walking distance to the theater subway restaurants drug store etc",5.0
never book a junior suite,"had booked a juniorsuite for 3 nights in august arrived at 1045 pm no valet no bellboy no help except the employe in the reception informing in that between 1040 and 1100 pm he was there alone
room 618 was extremely small and as i should show alle junior suite was next door to the elevator on all floors we did not sleep that first night
next day the receptionist after some discussion moved us to a standard room 615 in a more quiet part of the hotel this room was even smaller than the first aprox 20 m2
we asked if we could have money back for the difference in cost betwenn the two rooms  but was told that this was not possible becouse we had prepaid for our stay instead we were offered 30  to use in the hotel the differnce was much more
so dont stay here if you want a desent room and service",1.0
wonderful for airport stay,we cannot say enough about this place we only stayed one night our flight left in the am and were delighted with the clean room and friendly service we had a nice breakfast before we were shuttled to the airport left our vehicle there for 10 days on our return we called the motel and within 10 minutes the shuttle was there to pick us up and bring us directly to our vehicle we actually stopped in to thank them for such a wonderful stay and easy access to and from the airport this place is definately on our plans for next year the price is very right,4.0
girls 50th bday trip,ive been to nyc several times and stayed in many different areas this hotel was excellent the staff was fabulousattentive helpful and friendly i would like to make special mention of andre mgr and michael who were outstanding these folks could not have been more accomodating i want to spread the word but dont want to many people to find out about this gem of a hotel i cant say enough good things about this propertyfrom location cleanliness staff breakfast etceverything was topnotch ill be back,5.0
calling it boutique or european doesnt excuse everything ,i was booked at the paramount for a business trip  but i left before even staying the night the good lovely decor times square location personally i hate the area but i can understand why tourists might like it not sure what else the bad tiny tiny tiny rooms ive stayed is some small rooms  especially in nyc  but this was ridiculous the toilet was literally right behind the heater you couldnt even sit on the pot properly  youd have to sit sideways to take care of business theres about 2 feet of space between the edge of the bed and the wall and the room really is completely consumed by the bed not the cleanest place either the lounge chair had black soot all over it the wall covers were shabby didnt this place just get renovated the view from the room was horrible and just made it seem even dirtier i get that youre not always going to get a gorgeous skyline view but i didnt want to look out to see rolls of toilet paper and garbage see pics for a business trip this was completely unacceptable  so i left and rebooked at an spg property,2.0
clean nice and a perfect location,we stayed here for two nights the hotel was nice and clean the rooms were comfy and had all of the amenities for the price of hotels in sf and this being one of the lower priced hotels it was perfect the distance to the wharf was just 5 blocks down the hill and once you were there it seemed like hardly a walk at all the bus right by the hotel took us to the giants game and it was easy to figure out the staff at the hotel was nice and helpful as far as pointing us in the right direction for food and services would stay here again and would refer to friends and family,5.0
nice hotel  just a couple little things,"would recommend getting a room on the upper couple of floors i was on the 2nd floor nice because that is were the breakfast is but you get the road noise he friends on the top floor and the road noise was almost nil also they do not have blackout curtains like most hotels so the lights from outside can be bothersome other than that the staff was always pleasant and the hotel clean location really couldnt be any better you are right downtown and can walk any where you want to go
one warning though if you dont know its valet parking when i did my reservations over the phone they didnt tell me it was valet parking and it costs 17 a day the funny thing is that where they park your car is right next to the hotel i heard several complaints from people checking out that the valet fee wasnt disclosed they were nice enough to me and i got it taken off my bill 17 x 4 days yeahit adds up",4.0
loved it so much we came back for our honeymoon,"i wont go into a lot of detail because i have already written a previous review for a previous stay here but i will say this the mayfair is the best 
when we called the hotel they remembered me from several previous visits they were giving us a discount which is very hard to find in december in nyc but when we told them that it was for our honeymoon they went out of their way to make it a truly special stay for us
champagne awaiting us in our hotel room great staff everyone was so helpful in helping us to find perfect romantic spots to visit and eat carriage rides through central park the top of the rock at midnight ice skating a wollman rinkit was a perfect nyc honeymoon 
the mayfair doesnt disappoint you just have to know who to talk to and when where to ask for your room to be and let them get to know you the service is unbelievable when you do so psssstthe rooms on the street happen to be a lot bigger our first stay here was in a room where you opened the door and fell onto a bed and had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom we loved and laughed over that not many times you can say that you have that experience only when we saw one of the maids going into one of the rooms facing the front of the hotel did we realize that that was what we needed to be asking for
we will always stay at the mayfair no cc fraud here and no problems at all with the staff just a lovely unique hotel in a perfect location",5.0
i would definitely suggest you to stay there,very very nice place many major attractions are within walking distance the personnel is super friendly and helpful i really appreciated this a lot we had no bad impressions at all except that it was a bit noisy in the nights it seems that there are some night bars or clubs nearby that many people gather at nights which however would not be problem for people who are familiar with a bit of noise also if you choose a room that is not directly on the road it would be perfect overall i can suggest this hotel to everybody if i visit philadelphia again in the future i will stay in the same place,5.0
a gem on the bay,after a lot of review reading online we decided to go with the high ratings and take a chance on this little gem in san diego after talking with the front desk we were able to get a room in one of the new buildings overlooking the bay and it was a treat we had coffee on our deck as a regatta went by and drinks at night with a breathtaking view of the lights for the money we couldnt have been more pleasedand we didnt even need seaworld a perfect two night stay before our cruise,4.0
the people make the difference,in town for a wedding and weary from a day of missed flights from the east coast our first contact at the huntington was the professional and friendly doorman and bell staff throughout our week there they were without exception friendly helpful and down to earth calling us by name all week i found myself tipping well and often the hotel was built in 1926 by cp huntington one of the big 4 railroad tycoons along with hopkins stanford and crocker having spent some of my career at mr huntingtons shipyard in virginia the choice was a natural for me i was not disappointed the hotel is historic but updated in most respects smaller than the other nob hill hotels the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the big four restaurant highly rated by zagat our dinner there was both very good and expensivea special occasion venue unless on expense account we also followed the doormans recommendation of the nob hill cafe a quick 2 block horizontal walk excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices we booked one of the standard rooms through expedia for 121 per nighta bargain by any standard the king bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate the bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes a caffeine addict i was annoyed that there was no inroom coffee maker free coffee is available in the lobby only from 57 amok for the businessman but not if youre on vacation if you miss the deadline its 3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant internet access is 995 a day ending at 1 pm no free wifi as i have become accustomed to another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines you have to call the bellman and have it delivered the minibar was empty but i dont use those anywayit was handy for storing leftovers another unexpected bonusthe huntington has an agreement with hertz rental caryour paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to hertz and for an additional 20 you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning just hand the key to the doorman and walk in just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure theres a car available conveniently located on the cable car line 5 per person we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere8 to fishermans wharf and 10 to the museum the cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest i have found all in all we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customerseveryone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper even as we were leaving at 330 am to catch our flight back home,5.0
pricey but fantastic,having checked out of the pokey holiday inn we found this and what a find fantastic room excellent service free cycle hire the bar was full of people full of themselves but isnt every big city  after realising we could afford to stay there the staff were very attentive would stay again if in chicago,5.0
mediocre shelburne,"we booked a four night stay at the shelburne in a two bederrom suite we did this based on our friends experience withprevious stays at the affinia chain first the good news the apartment was spacious clean and relatively well equiped now for the bad news the rooms were not ready upon our arrival at check in time and we had to check back in with them the doorman was not in sight upon our arrival and i needed to search him out to have our vehicle valet parked this was done promptly there is no guaranteeof the type of beedding inthe suite and despite the large space there were two queen beds and a fold out sofa for our party of married couple and teen girl and 21 yr old son needless to say the fold out sofa was so bad oly a young child could sleep in itthey did graciously bring us a very nice roll away bed thedecor was ok somewhat datedthey had us on the 4th floor so there was some street noise
 one bit of annoyance was that the card keys didnt work for on of the interior doors of the suite i needed to go to the front desk at 11pmalong with another customer having similar problems i rode the elevator up with someone to unlock the door
 the workout room was in the basement next to the laundry not elegant but ok
 laslly it wasnt cheap although 2 bedrrom suite in ny are hard to come by the cost was about 650night with tax for a soso suite in a not premium time period",3.0
my stay at town and country resort hotel,i loved and enjoy my stay at town and country resort hotel thanksgiving day the service was excellent katherine richardson and staff made sure we were taken care of at all time whenever we called on katherine richardson she made sure it was done even if she had to do it herself your resort was the best stay in my life,5.0
w  as in why would you stay here,"sigh ws are really hit or miss sometimes they work sometimes not if you are ok with what this hotel is  a night club hot spot more concerned with style than substance with tiny rooms and impractical furnishings that will simply frustrate you  then this hotel will be great for you i stayed here for a onenight business trip two days after a colleague of mine and we both had the same impressions although she didnt have to switch rooms several times
first it is basically a block from the white house so locationwise it has a lot going for it i checked in around 6 pm on a weekday night the lobby was crowded with bar patrons not hotel guests but the wait wasnt too long the staff was somewhat friendly but efficient the door and bell staff were as usual friendlier than the front desk when i arrived at my door i noticed the doorbell and other indications of an accessible room which i did not want i looked inside and the layout confirmed this so i went down and asked for a nonaccessible room the host explained the rooms were all the same and gave me a new room
i was surprised to enter the new room and find  a bed seemingly only inches off the ground and the rest of the furniture similarly designed for people about 3 feet high the rooms are tiny so perhaps they figure lowtotheground furniture will help make the room look bigger it literally took me 5 minutes to figure out how to turn on the main lights i was relieved to learn my colleague had the same confusion the bathroom is typical w modern and sleek but the sink is a raised bowl with a faucet whose opening is about 3 above the drain i could not fit two hands underneath it im sorry but when style comes at the expense of function its gone too far this w goes too far and falls from hip into the far too frustrating category
when i returned from a late dinner to my topfloor room i was unhappy to hear a pounding disco above my head a call to the front desk assured me the noise would stop by 11 a second call some time later assured me the music would stop at midnight then the room physically started shaking as the people above me were obviously jumping up and down in unison this time i insisted a manager come to the room she said it was a wedding reception and would be going on until well after midnight of course if it hadnt been a reception it would have been the ws standard night club to her credit she felt the room vibrate and heard the noise and quickly arranged a transfer to a room on a lower floor once i figured out how to turn off all the little neon lights i got a decent sleep just two hours later than i wanted

great place to stay,"the rooms are clean and comfortable i dont know if the rooms around us were empty but we never heard any noise from the other rooms the hotel shuttle to and from the airportsea world and mcrd was great we picked howard johnson due to the location shuttle service and the breakfast we were not disappointed 
the front desk staff especially a gentleman by the name of dobri was very helpful 
he was so helpful professional and friendly we had never been to san diego before and he was able to answer our questions give us suggestions on things to do and places to eat because of him we ventured out to a few places we probably would not have he was wonderful with my kids my younger son especially when he was telling us about the uss midway museum and how much he would like it and just telling him about san diego in general he took the time to answer all of my questions and explain everything to me i also observed the way he handled other guests and he was always pleasant and professional but warm and welcoming as well in my opinion he went above his duties on a number of occasions we would absolutely stay again",5.0
location service comfort for travellers,"located on van buren the neighborhood isnt actually the best one of phoenix but is pretty close to phx and thats why we stayed there in 2010
service is good as well as cleanliness and breakfast is actually excellent considered the class of the hotel
they serve the airport and the rental terminal with a complimentary shuttle bus
all in all a great value for anyone who need to stay close to sky harbor for some time",5.0
this location is unbeatable,what a fantastic hotel its dark yes but this was not an issueits actually great if youre jetlagged it was clean and the sheets pillows and bed were all great quality and comfortable the rooms are smallish but we stayed for 10 days with two massive suitcases and didnt seem to have a problem the breakfast is included and its minimal but we ate out most days anyways staff were all very friendly and there is always someone at reception 247 the locations is unbeatable a few doors down from times square also  no bed bug issues which is a major issue in ny at the moment we got the room at a great rate and it was exceptional value for money  wed stay here again,5.0
rude rude staff total ripoff,"we stayed at the w last month and were completely dissapointed we had actually booked for 9 nights but moved after 2 it was soooooo bad
firstly my husband arrived separately from a conference in the us he was not allowed to check in as they didnt have his name on the booking despite his name being on every booking form i had as well as receipts from the hotel when checking outhe therefore had to wait 3 hrs in the lobby whilst we arrived
our rooms we had 2 were tiny noisy and bright all night
the staff were rude and arrogant with attitude they were so busy looking at themselves they had no time to assist anyone 
an extremely disapointing beginning to a 2 week family holiday fortunately we relocated to the london ny which was far better value and fabulous in every way",1.0
best service location rooms for the price,"i cant begin to tell you how much i appreciate staying at the sheraton jacksonville after my most recent trip staying at the w miami beach i have a new found love and respect for the entire staff at this hotel the level of service is far superior to any that i receive staying anywhere else ive stayed over 70 nights throughout the year at this hotel alone who would ever think that a 2 star hotel would far exceed a six star hotel in miami beach 
the rooms are tastefully decorated and the beds are super comfortable the tvs are hd lcd and provide excellent programming however they need to get the history channel back working again strange that it is the only channel that doesnt work 
you simply cannot beat the superior location by the mall every conceivable dining option is a short drive away if you have a pet the sheraton jacksonville welcomes you with open arms and a warm heart i cannot say enough great things about the entire staff they are a true five star staff providing exceptional quality customer service michael the gm obviously picks and trains his people well",5.0
disappointed with the worn condition of facilities,"positives great location convenient to metro dupont circle gwu downtown
large suites with fully equipped kitchens quiet clean despite what others have written friendly staff
cons furnishings have long since seen better days the sofa had a huge gash with stuffing coming out several of the limited  of tv channels didnt work nbcpbsespn2 the rooms were overheated our room keys had to be replace twice in 4 days because of problems with the lock treadmill in the gym didnt work and although there was a water cooler in the gym there were no cups available",2.0
very comfortable suprisingly quiet and luxurious hotel,"note i live in boston but was awarded a free nights stay here through my business this hotel is housed in what used to be the boston police department headquarters so ive always been wanting to stay here and see how they transformed this landmark building while i did not pay for my stay im writing this review with the mindest of how i would view this hotel if i had actually paid for the room based on the current prices listed on their website which is currently listed at 195 for a superior king for the month of december 2010
check in was smooth personable and very friendly i was made to feel right at home and even offered a warm towel to freshen up the staff also asked me if i already had dinner plans and was more than eager to offer suggestions 
my room was a superior king and was very spacious and full of all kinds of unique and helpful items that set this hotel apart from other hotels ive stayed at in this class for starters its stocked with a great selection of amazing kiehls bath products they also have a towel warmer hair dryer iron safe and an empty fridge so you can go out and buy your own things and keep them cold many hotels overstock the mini bar so you cant really use the fridge for anything you might want to buy on your own in my opinion this was better and if i really needed anything else they have 24 hour room service 
the bathroom had a motion triggered nightlight which was so helpful in the middle of the night never saw that in a hotel before and think every hotel should have them clever there is also a really nice cd player and sound system with a remote control a huge flat screen television free wifi as well as an ethernet cable for laptops and a large desk one thing that they didnt have in the room that i felt would be a nice addition is a dvd player but perhaps that will come in the future
the room was also very quiet as it was in the back part of the hotel not sure how the front facing rooms are for sound but my room was really quiet the bed was very comfortable and i slept very well
another great feature of this hotel is the amount of drawer space for your clothes many hotels either have just one drawer for your clothes or just enough for one guest while i was a solo traveler i noticed at least 3 large drawers on each side of the bureau as well as plenty of space in each of the nightstands and a very large closet plenty of space for two guests to store clothes 
my room didnt have any views and im really not sure what views the other room would offer in this part of town but i wouldnt expect too much in that regard since the hotel is surrounded by lots of other buildings
breakfast was also very good they have an extensive buffet option but i chose to order from the menu the bar area is also very nice with a very cool and modern fireplace
there are also lots of great restaurants nearby including geoffreys that offers great comfort food and cocktails at surprisingly low prices and grill 23 which is a really great steakhouse with typical steakhouse prices
overall i had a really nice experience and i will definitely be suggesting this hotel to my friends and family",5.0
comfortable clean and convenient,"this was my second stay this month at the courtyard at easton and it has become my first choice for business travel to columbus the hotel looks and feels new and the rooms are very immaculate the beds are comfortable and there are at least five foam or feather pillows on the triplesheeted king size beds the room is roomy with a large desk area and a pullout sofa if you need it youll need to use a ethernet cable youll find it hanging in your closet for internet in your room but i think wireless service might be available in the lobby the sink and dressing area are separate from the toilet and tub and both areas are spotless nice toiletries are provided
the breakfast is very reasonable 895 with lots of choices the cookedtoorder omelettes are delicious the service is excellent and its buffet style there is a little convenience store for snacks at times other than breakfast 
if you need a small refrigerator ask for one at checkin they are complimentary and will be brought to your room quickly shop at trader joes less than a block away and stock up on beverages and snacks for your room
the hotel may be slightly more than usual for a courtyard but due to location at a fabulous shopping area its great if you can travel on business and take time for shopping after work there are many great restaurants at easton the airport is minutes away and the hotel has a shuttle
there are great chewy otis spunkmeyer cookies also complimentary at the reception desk the entire staff is professional friendly and very helpful ill stay here again",5.0
fantastic hotel,we are currently staying here as i write this review the staff is wonderful the breakfast is delicious with great variety each day the rooms are so comfortable the pool lovely the showers are hot the beds and pillows are comfy and the location is perfect our only issue was with our ac and the engineers were up to the room in about 2 minutes and very accomodating and offered to switch us to a different room which we didnt feel was necessary in the end i think it was just the exhast fan in the bathroom that wasnt working right which meant the humidity level was high we upgraded to a suite for the second half of our stay and it is wonderful too i would reccomend spending a bit more for the suite especially if you are traveling with your family lots of space bigger kitchen area with a bar to sit at larger fridge and counter area we will stay here again anytime we come back to chicago i cant comment on the restaurant because we havent eaten there yet,5.0
great location clean rooms but not as good a value as it could be,"ive stayed at this property for nearly 25 years when visiting relatives in encino and sadly its gotten harder to recommend it 
pros my room was clean and comfortable the hotels location is superb  next to i405 and within five minutes of the ventura freeway even someone unfamiliar with los angeles can find it easily although the hotel is next to the freeway rooms have enough soundproofing that i didnt have trouble sleeping at night there is a small pool that appeared to be clean
there is too much traffic to go jogging in the neighborhood around the hotel but there is a 23 mile jogging trail about a mile west of the hotel around balboa golf course that is safe and quite attractive ask the front desk clerk for directions
cons although the rooms are clean and well maintained their decor is very dated it looks as though the decor hasnt been changed since the mid 1980s when laura ashley floral prints were the hottest fashion trend 
also the hotel does not offer free breakfast unlike most hotels in this price point yes there is a dennys on site but breakfast for a family of four will be at least 30  day and dennys food is not very nutritious at least the room had a refrigerator 
the next time im visiting this area i would probably choose the hampton inn down the street unless the rates at the carriage inn were significantly cheaper than the hampton inns rates",3.0
spare a thought for this hotel at 911,"by the title i mean this hotel has a two lane road separating it from the twin towers what a scary thought as most of us only think about the people in the actual towers anyway i arrived for my two night stay here and was immediately impressed lovely bustling entrancereception bbok in was quick friendly and efficient got a great room with amazing views i was actually looking at all the 4000 workers on the ground zero memorial site amazing i have always stayed midtown or uptown i like this part downtown round the corner from wall street next door to trinity church the walk to the battery park staten island and ellis island ferries was 7 minutes i am a solo traveller so safety is a major issue with me i never needed to give it a thought
room was gorgeous modern very comfortable and spotless all the staff were very friendly luxurious toiletries beautiful spacious bathroom i could not fault this place there was a games consul and a mini bar i loved this hotel would definitely come back here and would recommend it to everyone great discount shop next door century 21 brand names at fantastic prices",5.0
amazing stay kids are treated like royalty,"i had a terrific 5 night stay with my wife and 3 kids ages 9 7 and 5 we booked an executive suite with 2 double beds upon arrival to our room on the 41st floor i was struck by the amazing view lake michigan and the hancock building right across the street
the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom was of very good size the showers water pressure was amazing room service and housekeeping was fast and corteous always
my children received a treat every single day as soon as we left the room for the day they were looking forward to the afternoon evening to see what was awaiting for them at the room something different every single day the fs is an upscale venue but extremely kid friendly
the swimming pool is amazing we enjoyed it one night and the easy access to 900 michigan shops is like icing on the cake
i must say that the concierge staff was amazing karen made a difference in our stay the entire concierge staff really went out of their way to make us feel right at home
it has only been 2 weeks since we came back and my kids ask me to go back better yet beg me every single day",5.0
hit and miss it seems,we stayed in a room with two beds the room was clean enough but very drab and in need of renovation especially the bathroom there is a large walk in closet they advertise free wireless but there was no access from our room and staff did not have the knowledge to give advice on connecting the exercise room is not in working order breakfast is self serve toaster muffins orange juice coffee and bananas and is not well maintained by staff it is in a good location,2.0
second stay better than the first,i95 is not know for great lodging options but this hotel has been great twice i stayed at this hotel after leaving home late for a weekend trip to savannah in 05 and was very impressed now once again this time on biz the property was clean and affordable as an additional bonus the area seams relativly safe and there are several other lodging options just in case plus many food and gas options are available,4.0
nice stay at the sofitel,"room was lovely had a view of the empire state building on the 20th floor room number 2015 chocolates every night and turndown service was quite nice
apparently there was an understaffing issue when it came to the room service staff so i had quite a few delegates we were there for a meeting who hadnt had their linens changed and werent brought fresh towels big mistake 
overall id say this hotel is lovely if youre looking for a place that caters to a different kind of traveler ie the ceo of your firm this is the place its a bit pricey for tourists but then again what can you expect of a hotel two blocks away from times square",3.0
this is a great downtown austin value,i live in austin my husband and i stayed here overnight for valentines day this is a great hotel it is within walking distance of the austin night spots the room was spacious and clean and we had a great view of the capital koriente is a lovely intimate cool affordable restaurant just a couple of minutes walk across the street keep in mind that you are directly on 6th street and it stays noisy pretty late even on the 16th floor we could hear the traffic noise so pack your earplugs,4.0
surprising space and customer service,i have stayed at this hotel twice as a business traveler the first time i was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a junior suite and the level of service provided the second time i realized the first time was not a fluke but a way of doing business at this property the rooms are large and comfortable and the entire staff appears to be intent on making each guest comfortable they quickly and eagerly provide advice restaurant recommnedations directions etc the fitness center is far above what most hotels provide and the elevators are very fasta big plus in nyc the rooms also have a very good deskwork area with lots of outlets for computers chargers etc to top it all off the rates are very reasonable great views too highly recommend,5.0
perfect stay,stayed here in november great service spacious room  i mean this is nyc and centrally located the person below who complained its not near times square should stay in a hotel in times square i would stay here every time i need a hotel in nyc,4.0
not what it used to be,"i have stayed at this property on several occasions and i am sad to say this was the last the location is amazing but everything else seems to be on a steady decline andrea at the front desk is one of the most incompetent people i have ever come across each time i was at the desk there was another guest complaining we spent 45 minutes checking in for a onenight stay and all of the requests on my reservation were marked incorrectly 
the hotel used to have a welcome package in the room with snacks drinks and chocolates instead i was welcomed by the permeating stench of a stale ashtray the rest of our party ended up on a different floor even though we requested the rooms together i get the whole concept of it being a request but there was no effort to fix or accommodate us at all 
they have imposed a new 10 daily resort fee im not sure how a small inn with less then 100 rooms and no real ammenities can even use the term resort the bedding was uncomfortable and our view was a brick wall parking across the street was 42 for one night which is completely obnoxious but better than waiting for the valet who was about as efficient as the girl at the front desk 
she charged the credit card that was supposed to be holding our room without consent while trying to resolve the situation it turned out it wasnt my card that was charged at all but our friends in the 2nd room were charged for both rooms we just gave them cash but now 3 days later i find that my card was charged after check out so we have paid for the stay twice at this point
andrea told me she is the manager there now and i can promise if and as long as that is the case i will spend the extra money to stay at the radisson for my future visits",2.0
really comfy convienient and friendly hotel,"i have just returned from 4 days in new york where i stayed at this hotel the staff are so friendly and helpful they can even tell you which subway entrance to take to get to a particular station the studio room was fine clean and plenty of room for just me huge bed with fabulous cotton sheets having the kitchen is great coffee machine provided bathroom always really clean masses of towels and the toiletries they provide are very good quality the spa looked fine there is a steam room and a gym but i didnt get time to use it there are lots of coffee shops and a deli to buy food from nearby best convienient restaurant is a little italian called squisito just up the hill on east 34th street from the hotel which makes great pizza and thick soups etc the people in there are really friendly and funny
i was on my own for almost two days and found new york a really easy place to walk around or take the subway the hotel will give you a good map 
book the hop on hop off city bus on line before you go for a really good deal and well worth doing as the commentaries are funny and informative and the extras they include in the online deals make it very good value for money
have lots of other tips too but the hotel made the whole visit really a pleasure as a single lady in new york",4.0
good for the money,when looking at austin hotels i originally wanted something downtown but settled on the omni southpark my reason was it was about half the price of the hotels downtown but just as nice the omni was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly the location is also a plus since it is close to both the airport and downtown the omni also offered a shuttle to take us back to the airport when we were leaving this is now my favorite hotel in austin and i will be staying here again in the future,5.0
great location if you want to see the sights and dine well,we stayed at the hotel for three days had a great time staff we on the whole very good room was very nice whilst parking was not onsite this was not an issue as we walked everywhere and didnt get the car until we were ready to leave philly the choice of restaurants nearby was fantastic breakfast was okay but not fantastic but this appears to be the standard in most us hotels now,4.0
the most fun trip to chicago  ever,the wit is a boutique hotel on state street it is walking distance to everything downtown and is close to the chicago river the rooms are hip and fun with amazing dowtown views but what makes this a great hotel is the staff they are so professional at what they do everyone from the concierge to the servers to the housekeepers went way above my expectations we were treated like royalty and we will definately be back the 27th floor houses the roof a bar and restaraunt with retractable a roof and walls this place is so much fun with amazing views and ambiance,5.0
a wonderful hotel,we stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for one week while visiting chicago it is a spectacular hotel our room on the 27th floor overlooked both the city and lake michigan it was very large comfortable and immaculately clean the bathroom which was marble had a separate shower and was luxurious and also kept sparkling from the checkin staff to the concierge valet and housekeeping  the service was great all in all a wonderful hotel with one small exception  the restaurant on the premises is extremely pricey and not worth the money try breakfast just steps away at tempo or walk one block up rush st to feast  much better ambience better food and way better prices otherwise i highly recommend the sofitel  a gorgeous comfortable hotel in the heart of a beautiful area,5.0
my trip to howard johnson,the breakfast was okay the milk was warm and the food was not fresh the floors were dirty and the rooms were dirty but it is a good value for the dollar at the location i did not spend a lot of money i was happy about the value of the place,3.0
simply a great hotel,the staff was extremely courteous and attentive the rooms well designed and comfortable though we did not make much use of the pool and rooftop bar they looked top notch room service was prompt and delicious as well this place is highly recommended,5.0
good hotel  excellent location,after reading some of the previous reports i was a little worried about this hotel dont take these reports in this hotel is just what you want when staying in nyc the staff are friendly and helpful and the location is excellent the rooms are clean and adequate and the hotel overall is v good the bar is expensive and the deli across the road is good for breakfast and a late evening snack walking distance to the empiretime squarerockefellercentral park etc there is a tube station a few blocks north on lexington ave if you want to go to the wtc i would stay at this hotel again and cant wait to return to nyc,4.0
always happy at the marriott east side,my husband and i have stayed all over the city with our children and without 2 girls 7  9 comparing the marriott east side to the hilton on 6th or the w in times square its easy to give this hotel a rave review we were just their from oct 69 when we arrive we are always greeting with smiles and hellos the hotel guest relations coordinator kenda remembers us everytime we go about 3 times a year this particular stay we reserved a jr suite with a pull out sofa for our children when we got to the 6th floor room it smelled of smoke nonsmoking hotel and the tub was clogged i called down to the at your service desk and requested a change of rooms due to the fact of an asthmatic child we were not given the same room but instead the ambabassador suite on the 33rd floor the hotel staff could not have been more helpful my profile with marriott states that i have an asthmatic child however i dont feel that this is why i was switched to such a large suite i believe it is the relations that the staff tries to keep with its guest i have never experienced a rude employee at this hotel having stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 5 i find that quite amazing not sure if everyone knows this but jw marriott is the parent company for the ritz carlton as a frequent guest of the ritz in boston as well as the ritz beach resort in naples fl it is easy to compare this category 7 marriott to the ritz for anyone who expects a large hotel room in nyc should do somemore research most that ive stayed in have been quite small im sure do to the fact that the city is so populated paying over 500 a night was completely fine for what we got even if our room hadnt changed location just blocks from the best shopping and sites in nyc the easy highway access and the fact that you are in such a large city and yet at this hotel you get the feel that you are in a neighborhood i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy new york,5.0
good for business trip no free breakfast,i stayed there for a week in september the hotel is in an industrial part of san diego close to freeways youll pretty much need a car if you want to go anywhere although i saw a bus stop 5 minutes walking distance the hotel has a big enough parking lot and the rooms are standard but nice mine had a mini fridge and a microwave the free wifi internet connection always worked the swimming pool is big enough to swim laps and the fitness room right next to the pool has 4 cardio machines plus weights the staff is friendly and helpful unlike some other hotels in the area this one doesnt offer a free continental breakfast in the morning a short drive away on cairemont mesa youll find plenty of restaurants however at 7am mc donalds is the only one open,3.0
this is our favorite in nyc,we love this hotel in nyc its clean and convenient right in the heart of times square its pricey and the rooms are small but come on its nyc what do you expect staff is great,5.0
go for the history and atmosphere,"we stayed at the waldorf for a business event and we were there for less than 12 hours overall its a beautiful hotel  the lobby the banquet hall etc the room was paid for by the company so keeping that in mind
checkin took a very long time our attendant was very nice however we think she may be been in training as we were standing there at the desk for at least 15 minutes  to the point that we asked is everything all right we had booked a king bed room and they had us in a double bed room  i believe they upgraded us to the waldorf towers although i dont recognize any of the rooms in which we stayed on the website but i dont know if we originally had booked in the towers or the hotel we were on the 28th floor
the elevator and hallway were very pretty i did not notice any signs of aging in the tower however i did notice a smell in the hall  maybe it was a smoking floor our room did not smell of smoke the room itself was very nice  marble floors separate tub and shower and a walkin closet there was a nice view of park avenue and st barts church below the water pressure was virtually nonexistent and when you used the sink the stopper held the water in the sink in the shower it was a tiny bit better be careful walking around the room the bed frame stuck out several inches from the bed and we banged our shins on it a couple of times
later when we went to sleep we could not figure out how to turn off the light underneath the sink nor could we determine how to close the opague shades at night so with the lights from outside it basically looked like daylight in our room we were so tired and it was late so we decided not to call the front desk to have someone come up to the room the bed was very comfortable
at the very least you should go visit the lobby of the hotel if you visit nyc you could find similarly located hotels with room rates that are about the same",4.0
ok location  trendy hotel,"we stayed in one of the smaller suites at this hotel because there were three of us since we were travelling as a couple and a mutual friend we were hoping to get a separating door between the living room and the bedroom we called the hotel and they assured us that we would get exactly that of course we were still nervous about this but when we arrived it all fell in to place the suite was big and there was a separating door just like we asked for they offered free wifi in the lobby as well as in the room
the bathroom was quite small but very clean and well maintained there were two large tv sets and good storage possibilities for all of us we had a view overlooking the roof top gardens opposite the street
there were two elevators but only one working during the entire stay and the music inside the elevator was quite loud which will get you in to a party mood or get you annoyed  decide for yourself 
the location is quite ok but a bit off according to what we normally book whenever we go to new york its a 10 minute walk to the empire state building
at one point we found a tiny insect in the bed and told the staff at the reception and they actually sanitized the whole room within an hour which we found to be very impressing
over all we were very pleased with our stay",4.0
kudos to nina the queen,we stayed at the lenox for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday and run the boston half marathon after checking in i stopped by the concierge desk to get some information nina the woman on duty commented on a crown shaped pendant i was wearing i told her it was a gift from my husband and that i am the queen of our home she laughed and said that she is the queen of the lenox in fact they call her qb queen bee for short we chatted a bit more and my husband and i headed for a quick lunch at her recommendation of pappa razzi for some carbo loading excellent we went back to the room and nina appeared with a basket of goodies power bars etc and a giant helium balloon it was a bumble bee of course how special and unbelievable i have never had such a thoughtful gesture made by a complete stranger there is no need to look further in boston than the lenox the location could not be more convenient the bed was comfortable and you are treated like family kudos,5.0
not a heavenly welcome,"a couple of weeks ago i finally managed to redeem a gift certificate for the westin seattle that i had purchased through a charity auction two years agowe decided to take our 14 year old son along for a week in the city so i added an additional day to make the weekend in downtown seattle a memorable experience for my wife and son
it was memorable alright
i took the advice of a fellow trip advisor member to forego the hotel parkade  save ½ of the parking costs by utilizing the westin building parkade which is linked to the hotel by a walkway as we unloaded the luggage from the car my son  i went looking for a luggage cart in which to transport our bags to the hotel room we found one at the end of the walkway on the 2nd floor of the hotel near the meeting rooms we took the cart back to where our car was parked where we loaded up our luggage  proceeded to the front desk to register 
while i was checking into the hotel my wife was approached by a bell attendant who told her that she could not use this cart when she responded that it was left in the upstairs lobby near the walkway the attendant then told her in front of other hotel guests the cart was his responsibility and that she should not have taken it and that he could get in trouble with his boss  my wife responded that maybe the hotel should have put a sign on it telling patrons to not use the luggage carts the attendant then insisted that he bring our luggage up to the room 
unaware of the encounter that transpired i proceeded to the hotel room along with my family the bell attendant and our luggage after he left my wife then told me the story of what had happened it reminded me of a scene from the english comedy faulty towers 
since we were on a bit of a schedule i chose to wait until i returned home to comment on this experience rather than make a formal complaint i felt sorry for the fellow as he appeared stressed out during my brief encounter with him",3.0
paper thin walls in expansive hotel,stayed at the westin bonaventure for several nights to attend a conference at the la convention center the hotel is huge with 34 separate towersi was in the blue the staff was ok didnt always seem too knowledgeable of the area i asked which direction to head for shopping once and another time a specific address on south figueroa street to an avis rentacar both times they werent sure which direction to send me the room itself was fine and the amenities were good the heavenly bed just as comfortable as at other westins cons charging 1295 per day for internet and paper thin walls my first night i was awakend at 3am by the party next to me2 guys and a loud woman the next morning i could hear a entire business meeting carried on in the room on the opposite side of me also could hear the guests in the room above me through the vents from time to time enjoyed using the fitness room which was large and well appointed experienced the main barrestaurant in the lobby where the service and food were perfectly fine wouldnt refuse to stay here again but hope to experience something else on my next la visit,3.0
comfy roomy and great staff,"enjoyed the stay in the wingate jacksonville south the hotel was very quiet nice outdoor pool and big indoor hot tub the breakfast room is very nice and great breakfast and service
the staff is very friendly on all fronts the rooms are comfy beds nice and clean the decor is florida style and getting a little more dated  but again clean and comfy
i will be back",4.0
true southern hospitality,i just got home from staying at the peabody and i am happy to announce that southern hospitality is alive and well in memphis from the moment we walked into the hotel and were greeted by a bellman to the moment we left and another bellman saw us off our stay there was well worth the trip after reading other comments on this site i was feeling nervous about my choice however when i finally got there i could not understand all of the negative comments my room was a nice size clean and well stocked with area guides etc it is true that the bathroom was small however it is because that is how they were built at the turn of the century and it is simply part of the culture and charm of the hotel also the staff couldnt have been any nicer or helpful i would recommend the peabody to anyone,5.0
hotel during carmageddon,i had a very early flight out of lax during carmageddon so instead of dealing with traffic i stayed at the lax hilton hotel for an easy morning commute the selfparking experience was unique in having to go down 4 levels before you could find a parking that was not for valet that was not bad and once i got into the lobby i was impressed with the hotel it was nice had a nice lobby when i went into my room i was very pleased this was a nice hotel i would definitely recommend it was just the one night and the shuttle the next morning to the airport was convenient,4.0
absolutely fantastic,absolutely fantastic this is all i can say about my stay at the inn at union square after visiting the beautiful san franciso several times on business and just staying in big hotels as radisson and hilton and in some other boutique and nice hotels as serrano ive decided to look at trip advisor to find out a new and nice hotel to stay with my wife in a special trip that we where facing as our 2nd honeymoon it was when i got really impressed about so many positive reviews about the inn at union square always rated among the top 5 hotels in san francisco and then weve booked it from hotelscom since our arrival in san francisco everything there it was so perfect staff was absolutely outstanding we got an upgrade for a very nice suite our suite super clean and its amenities were really great wireless internet and continental breakfast were complimentary as wine and cheese wow from 57 pm everyday as well this is the place where we really feel at home so i strongly recommend this hotel for everyone im sure youll love it,5.0
good location but rooms not ready upon arrival,just back from a 4 night stay at the hilton times square hotel very comfortable but was very disappointed that our rooms were not ready when we arrived at 2pm after a long and tiring flight we were told to come back at 3pm and they would be ready we had to walk around the area for an hour or so to kill time when all we wanted to do was get into our rooms and freshen up i was travelling with my elderly parents both in their mid 70s who were exhausted and just wanted to lie down when we got back to the hotel at 4pm the rooms were still not ready eventually one room became available and then after 30 minutes of constantly calling reception i finally went down and argued with the desk clerk i booked this hotel because it had great reviews and is a better class of hotel but wouldnt recommend it if you are looking to get into your room before 5pm in the evening why it takes so long to make rooms available especially when you have to check out by 12 noon is beyond me,4.0
a welcoming stay as always,"i recently returned from boston and my 3rd stay at the back bay hotel i really love this place its location is definitely a huge plus point  right in the heart of the back bay area within easy walking distance of some great shopping newbury street the prudential center etc restaurants and boston common as well as a number of t stations 
as for the hotel itself it has real character throughout from the buidling the old police headquarters to the classic decor to the people working there the rooms although not necessarily huge are comfortable very clean and have great bathrooms the bar cuffs downstairs is a great place to hang out relax and defrost in front of the fire and feels much more cosy and welcoming than a lot of hotel bars ive been in the staff have been fantastic on every visit and this time was no exception they smile say hello to you in the corridor and hold doors open for you i have always made to feel like a welcome guest and will definitely return to the hotel in future",5.0
i wanted to love this place but,"the palomar kimpton is enigmatic some aspects of our stay were wonderful others not so much
i hope tripadvisor allows me to say this so here goes i got 2 weekend rooms on a certain nameyourownprice website and ended up at the palomar i had once stayed at the muse in new york city another kimpton and enjoyed that so i was looking forward to the palomar our price was good much lower than the rack rate
like many hotels in la the location is central that is its not walking distance to anything in la i guess good location means no more than a 45 minute drive it may be excellent for certain business visitors though that was not our purpose
i detest smokers and i have a smoke allergy i called ahead to verify a nonsmoking room and was told not to worry all the rooms are smoke free not so fast both rooms given to us were obviously smoked in one so bad it would almost gag you i know the hotel cant control their guests but they can certainly scour the rooms after some deadbeat smokes in one and not release that room until it is clean we were transferred to smoke free rooms
then there was was issue with the dead battery in the electronic door lock all i know is the lock stopped working ok new key doesnt work called maintenance had an appointmentplease expedite i guess expedite was interpreted as expedition as that was what it took to get new batteries in and get the lock working
the doors have virtually no soundproofing so you hear everyone walking the halls the walls are thin for a hotel with high aspirations we could hear our neighbors through the wall unfortunately it was all g rated oh well
on the upside the hotel had a nice wine tasting in the afternoons the bar is nice the front office is very service oriented
this was probably a lower end marriott or hilton bought out by kimpton and boutiqued but basically it remains a lower end marriott or hilton with an upscale finish and an excellent staff because our price was low the value was there if i paid rack rate i would not be happy",3.0
great nyc hotel,we originally booked the cozy room but asked for an upgrade during check in which we luckily got the upgraded room was large for a nyc hotel room and the bathroom was large too the location is great its away from the major tourist spots yet only a little walk away we will definitely return to this hotel when we are back in nyc,5.0
great stay great prices,stayed here last weekend and would highly recommend we got a great deal 13500 includes breakfast for two and valet parking service was fantastic from start to finish cant wait to stay again,5.0
ive upgraded my previous review,i have stayed here a few more times since my first review and although the location is still a potential issue i have been impressed with this property on my last two stays the staff is great the place is very clean and the beds are exceptionally comfortable i arrived for the last stay during a snowstorm and the fire going in the lobby fireplace was quite welcoming also im not sure why i was told they did not have bathtubs on my first visit but it turns out they do have them and we were given a complimentary rollaway on one of the visits which was appreciated the best part of the place is their complimentary car service its very convenient and the drivers are very nice too you naturally may have to wait at times though if you do not need to be in a specific area then this is a good option and be sure to ask for a room with a mountain view,4.0
central location but not great,stayed here during a busines trip choose the hotel based on the location which is fantastic the hotel is very large internet is only working for free in the lobby which was a bit annoying the rooms are clean and rather large for new york overall the rooms are quite dated and could do with a general refurb not sure if i would stay here again asfor the money paid i would have expected a five star experience mieke,3.0
fun and friendly place to stay,this hotel is immaculately clean and well maintained we were greeted in a friendly manner by the entire staff everyone was anxious to be helpful the checkin staff made sure to explain procedures clearly and offer assistance in any way possible the location was close to dupont circle and other areas were within easy walking distance it was easy to use public transportation and cabs to get around parking your own car and then using the public transportation is the way to go we have stayed here twice now and been pleased by both of our stays,5.0
the worst service they really make you feel bad,"stay away from this hotel
people in the checkin will make you feel as if you were bothering them then when you park at the entrance  they make you move your car to the back without telling you before that you have to pay 18 per day 
those employees were very disgusting they have no manners no idea how to be courteous to the costumers 
the hotels heating system does not work incredible 
they will charge you for almost everything like wifi tv etc
im glad only was one night",1.0
great place to stay,"arrived for an extended business stay in jacksonville florida our company normally places us in a standard hotel but do to my length of stay i opted for a suite hotel with a full kitchen upon entry to the parking lot of this facility i could tell this place would be something special the area was very clean very neat and meticulously maintained upon entry to the lobby i was greeted by friendly staff and a unique lobby decor i secured my key and proceeded to the room i entered a found a very well appointed kitchen area and very clean the living room had a large flat screen tv with a very comfortable couch and lounge chair with automon i then inspected both bedrooms they were clean neat and well appointed each had flat screen tvs and a very user friendly clock radio the sheets and bedspreads were clean and smelled very fresh 
i then inspected the bathroom very clean with excellent water pressure from the spigot the towels were of a better quality than expected
overall the room was great the air conditioners were quiet and kept the room and a very nice temperature 
the pool area was just as nice and the jacuzzi worked perfectly
i only had one minor concern about an otherwise excellent stay the breakfast was not quite what i was expecting for such a well appointed hotel the breakfast was a bit disappointing but this would not in any way be the deciding factor of whether to stay again 
i highly recommend this hotelyou will not be disappointed",4.0
overrated and overpriced,location was good but it is not value for the money we stayed three nights  at an average of us275night for one room we were late arriving by train into penn station and had no hotel booked and it was the first one we saw we were too tired to bother trying elsewhere even when we heard the price the hotel pictures online do not tell the real story the lobby is impressive but it deteriorates from there our room was dingy but clean down the end of a long corridor on the 8th floor bathroom fittings were antiquated and need upgrading noise from night time roadworks and traffic was disturbing the lesson is do more homework and book in advance,2.0
bad disappointing choice for us in columbus,my husband and i like to stay at homewood suites so as we got close to columbus where we decided to stop for the day i researched with my phone and found this hotel and a hampton inn with rooms available we chose homewood since we wanted the suite with the refigerator that we could use to refreeze our blue ice and a microwave to make popcorn in case we did not like the evening offering at the managers reception the staff member at the check in was not very helpful did not explain room or amenities tried to get away with giving us one key when we got to the room it was not a suite like we have had at other homewoods did not even have a microwave or fridge and very small i wanted to go change it but my husband was extremely tired after driving for 11 hours did not want to bother the place where you eat dinner and breakfast is not connected to the rooms so you always had a long walk and had to go out in the chilly weather to get there the food was okay but not up to the standard of other homewoods we have stayed at there are several hotels in this vicinity and this hotel was the closest to 270 and our room faced it so it was very noisy plus all during the night there were train whistles going off frequently we had hoped for a restful reviving night to get ready for our next leg of our trip and that certainly did not happen definitely would not stay here again,2.0
colonnade hotel a great choice,staff is friendly and helpful beds are very comfy t station just outside the hotel is convenient for seeing the entire city tons of restaurants within walking distance on our last day there we discovered thorntons at 150 huntington  a good choice for breakfast,5.0
fantasy stay at the algonquin,my friend and i stumbled upon the algonquin by pure luck not only were we blown away with the character and charm of this fantastically located hotel we were more than impressed with the attention and service we received from the hotel staff during our stay we stayed in a standard room two single beds free wifi two bath robes nice bathroom tv ipod docking station etc the algonquin offers free coffeetea to its guests on the 2nd floor 24 hours a day via a single serve tassimo or something similar machine this was great in the morning when i was up early and needed to catch a train the hotel is about 2 minutes walking from times square 10 minutes from central park and 1 minute to 5th avenue the bar is really nice and has a replica round table that dorothy parker and her mates used to convene around every day back in the early 1900s very nice hotel to stay in while visiting new york city,4.0
never again  not at all like other hi express locations,"we were very disappointed with the condition of this hi express when we checked in we had the following problems
1 the air conditioner was not blowing coolcold air i called the front desk to ask for a different room the man  the desk told me he would call me back he never did we let it go because it was late  we were tired
2 there were no sheets for the sofa bed i had to go downstairs to ask for some because no one would answer the front desk phone
3 there was visible mold in the shower in the corner near the faucet on the shower curtain along the bottom and on the shower ceiling
4 there was a lot of dustgrime on the top of the ceiling fan blades and on the air vents in the room they had obviously not been cleaned in a long time 
5 this hotel is in a weird downtown area there were a few shady looking people hanging out in the lobby when we checked in around 10 pm 
i mentioned the problems to the lady at the front desk when we checked out this morning i will never stay at that location again",2.0
very good location,"stayed december 5 to 12th 2007
from sydney australia
very close to times square and a walk to everywhere very busy with christmas shoppers did not have breakfast their as only very sweet and fattening things available could do with boiled eggs as some other holiday inn express have across the street very close to places to have breakfast  very good restaurants in street for dinner as well right next door room was small supposed to be king bed but in width ok in depth cut off too short obviously to fit in room our feet hung over end of bed if you stretched out and i am only 52 tall some desk reception people need to be more friendly and helpful asked about arranging a broadway show were not helpful to us when leaving we asked reception to get us a car to travel to airport  after about 2 hours we got one  never been so frightened in travelling in my life private hire car and way too fast do your own hiring of cars also not one person from reception asked if we enjoyed our stay at end of 7 days  also airconditioning outside motor in next door offices very noisy during week days  ok weekends as is turned off made the walls vibrate and had to wear ear plugs this should and could be fixed by office owners next door overall close to everything and very clean",2.0
cant beat the location,you simply can not beat the location of this downtown hotel the alamo out the front door the riverwalk out the back also the customer service is excellent especially the doormenvaletbellman  always there to assist you however the valet fee of over 2200 per night was a bit excessive there is garage parking self across the street did not eat at the hotel as there are just too many choices in the area  both around the alamo and down on the riverwalk of course a trip to the riverwalk is not complete without a stop at durty nellies  a very fun piano bar singalong just watch out for the military folks letting off a little steam  completely understandable the only complaint i would have about this hyatt would be the size of the bathrooms  tiny after spending a few days last week at the hyatt regency lost pines near austin with their super large bathrooms the ones at this hyatt were just too small and they need to upgrade their hair dryers as well here is a restaurant suggestion  the barn door great steaks and they have a twicebaked potato with jalepenos that is to die for located about 15 minutes from the hotel not downtown and for the golfers try both courses at la cantera especially the palmer course if you like true hillcountry golf and the quarry  another great course overall a fantastic weekend in the alamo city if you cant find a place to party here then you just aint looking hard enough,4.0
surprisingly good,with the somewhat mixed bag of reviews i wasnt particularly optimistic going in however i found this hotel to be simply excellent the room was clean bed very comfortable best night of sleep i had gotten in a while and room service was both fast and delicious very fast internet with download speeds around 1mbsec i got a late start in the morning but the front desk had no problem extending my checkout by 2 hours every member of the staff was friendly and efficient i will definitely be staying here the next time im in the area,5.0
fab time at the pod hotel,"the pod hotel is a fantastic budget hotel my husband and i really couldnt have asked for better value ok granted the rooms are on the small side but who goes to new york to stay in their room
we opted for a bunk room as this was the cheapest option and we wanted to stay for as long as possible it was very clean with fresh towels spare toilet roll hairdryer wash basin and mirror provided
our room didnt have an en suite so we made use of the 4 bathrooms available on our floor the bathroom system is excellent  there are lights above your door to tell you which bathrooms are available we stayed for 8 nights and only on one occasion were all 4 in use at any one time we never had to wait and they were spotlessly clean with plenty of hot water
a few reviews mention the noise in the pod hotel so we went armed with ear plugs i think you have to accept that new york is a noisy city we were on the 9th floor and you can hear the street noise if you have your window open with the window closed i had no problems sleeping and our room came with air con to keep us cool yes the doors do slam if you let them but i cant say that this is a reason not to stay here
the staff were friendly and very helpful there are maps and tourist informationadvice available from reception they will also store your bags and arrange transport to the airport if needed they have a lovely lobby and outside patio area in which they have just started to provide breakfast for guests the general facilities are great ipod doc tvs and free internet access for every room you couldnt really ask for much more  even the location is great its close to the moma top of the rock 5th ave shops and a subway
i cant recommend the pod hotel enough if you are on a budget and want to stay in new york  this is most definitely a good bet",5.0
pleasantly surprised,"two night stay in august 2006 paid 80 per night via priceline
i highly expected the cold priceline treatment when i walked up to the desk at 11am on a thursday to checkin i am not sure if i just got a nice desk clerk or my hilton gold hhonors card did the trick but i was given a room in tower 1 on the 37th floor access to the executive level and free breakfast for both days she even added my hhonors account  to the reservation which they are not supposed to do for priceline stays
the room was small but had a nice view of the golden gate bridge everything was clean but room service was spotty the first night we received turn down service but the second night we did not we were given complimentary waters from the minibar but they never replenished the stock everything else was fine with housekeeping
for breakfast we choose the restaurant on the lobby level rather than the continental on the excecutive level the buffet which you may choose instead of a menu item was aboveaverage and opens at 6am the finger foods offering on the executive level from 5  7pm was not as good as the views from that level everything tasted like frozen food and the booze was cash bar waters and sodas were free and were great to take back to the room for later
i am not sure if access to the execututive level is actually controlled because there were a ton of people up there no checks at the door and a ton of children regardless it was a nice place to fill up on snacks before heading out to dinner
we did not use the pool but we checked it out and it was very small and basically sat inbetween the towersnot a very appealing environment the fitness center is small but i used some of the equipment and was pleased
one disconcerning experience was with the bell desk we needed to pickup our rental car so we asked to leave our bags for an hour or so after we checked out to save time we handed over the bags got our claim tickets and you could tell this guy wanted a tip already in my experience it is customary to tip after you retrieve your bags not upon dropping them off perhaps the normal business clientel throws around money more than we do but what did he do for a tipput a ticket on my bags
anyway after we got the car we went inside to get the bags gave our tickets and requested a cart this same guy points to our bags say get them yourself and told us to put them on the cart at this point another person at the bell desk offered to help he took the bags to the car and put them in the trunk for us he got the tip not the grinch who told us to do it ourselves
as for homeless people being reported right outside the doors of the hotel we did not experience this however if you walk around town you will encounter many for those of you who have spent time in manhattan this is not an issue for those of you from small towns i guess it can be unpleasant although i was unphased by homeless there appears to be a large population of mentally ill homeless people evidenced by screaming talking to themselves and in one case a nude woman all within walking distance of the hotel right across from hotel adagio and cortez restaurant
every city has homeless so if it really bothers you perhaps you should not walk around at night one reviewer suggested giving the homeless money i am not sure i agree with this and many expect more if you give a little again that comes from growing up around manhattan to each their own i guess
one thing i am sure of is that you should not let a few homeless citizens take away from the otherwise great loaction of this hotel a few blocks from bart major bus stop hubs streetcars and trolleys i recommend this for your first stay in san francisco since it really is at the center of it all",4.0

clean great location good value,"we took a girls trip to chicago and stayed at the river hotel for three nights i booked the hotel four months prior to our staywe were supposed to get a two bedroom suite about 225night and three days before leaving i received an email stating that the hotel had made a mistake and that room was actually not available on the first night of our stay but that they could give us two single rooms and would only charge us 87 for that night for both of those rooms then we would be able to choose if we wanted to move into the suite for the next two nights or if we wanted to stay in the single rooms initially i was very upsetthey should have at least called to tell me this information instead of merely emailing we arrived at the hotel around noon and they provided a safe place for us to leave our luggage until our room was ready around 3 we were able to check into the single rooms and we were pleasantly surprised very clean and modern when all was said and done we just decided to stay in these rooms because there was not a thing in the world wrong with them plus it would save us mega  they ended up charging us 87 per room per night and the first night we only had to pay for one room as a way to compensate for their mistake
staff at front desk were extremely helpful and cordial check in and check out were a breeze rooms were kept clean location was awesome felt very safe
for all of you complaining about the rooms being small the beds being short the staff not being helpful enoughyou didnt pay trump tower prices why expect trump tower amenitiesservice",4.0
charming and elegant,i was looking for somewhere different to stay in charlotte a change from the usual business hotels and found the morehead inn this hotel has a faded charm and elegance it is like staying in an old plantation house i stayed in the kingston room which is not in the main hotel but in the carriage house and was very quiet a few places on the bedroom walls were in need of a touch up but this did not detract from the overall charming impression breakfast is served in the wonderful formal dining room staying in this hotel is such a lovely experience i will be returning again to try out a different room,5.0

a great place to stay for the convenience of the airport,we stayed here due to its proximity to the airport and our early am flight our room was clean and everything was in its place nothing was broken like at our previous hotel we ate at the restaurant and had good food and good service the best part about it was the lap pool and whirlpool we werent sure if they had a pool until we got there and it was a nice surprise they also have a really nice gym  a number of treadmills and cardio machines and a whole lineup or weight machines i would definitely stay here again if i needed to be close to the airport we also used their airport shuttle which took us to our terminal we were out of terminal e and the hotel is connected to terminal b the shuttle came on time and even though we had 2 others to drop off before us it was very quick and easy,4.0
good location parking good for what you pay,"we found the hotel to be ok for the price it looked much nicer than other similar hotels in the neighborhood from the outside it was comfortable and parking  breakfast is included dont expect a 5 hotel but youll get a good deal the location is good close to union st and about 15 minute walk from lombards crookedest block 
if you stay there go for dinner at parma ristoranti its only 3 blocks away and has excellent pasta for a good price",4.0
great hotel well be back,we had a great stay at this hotel our first experience with laquinta the room and entire facility was very clean the bed was very comfortable the bath towels were nice not paper thin the showerhead massage was a nice extra theres a whirlpoolhot tub by the pool it was not working properly when we got there disappointment but after reporting it the maintenance crew had it bubbling the next morning staff was very friendly the free breakfast was very good well definitely stay there again,4.0
great rooms crowded breakfast,"great rooms
 rooms are large and newly remodeled they just finished remodeling all the rooms in march decor was contemporary and classy using dark wood the rooms include a wet bar microwave and fridge 
 new large flat panel tvs 42 in living room regular though large tv in bedroom
 we were told that they improved the soundproof quality of the rooms which i believe is true because we didnt hear a peep from anyone elses room 
breakfast buffet was chaotic
 the breakfast area was too small for the number of guests in the hotel it was a nightmare trying to get food the line for the omelets stretched 15 people long there seemed to be lines for everything and such tight quarters that people were constantly trying to get by you with trays of food the food was just soso good pancakes though limp french toast bland scrambled eggs overcooked omelets good crispy bacon potatoes consisted of nuggets of deep fried tatertot things
 they serve starbucks coffee in the coffee urns but it tasted burnt most of the time
 they were frequently out of things like clean silverware plates bowls milk fruit 
 now embassy is going to remodel all of the common areas in may 2007 they may fix this whole breakfast situation by making the area more expansive and efficient i wouldnt go during construction though
500pm snack hour was kind of fun
 they only serve potato chips tortilla chips pretzels and salsa 
 however they serve shirley temples for the kids and any alcoholic drink for the parents including for me a midori sour coffee and tea also included 
indoor swimming pool was good and bad
 it was nice having an indoor pool since it was 62 degrees outside pool was clean and wellkept
 however pool was small and extremely noisy tons of kids running around screaming making canonballs splashing my 2yearold and i stayed near the stairs and we made do im glad they had the pool because my son loved it but i just wish for my own sanity that it was bigger so that the kids would be spread out more
 i did appreciate the fact that the pool is right near the elevators so that you wouldnt have to traipse through the lobby in your robe and swimming suit
front desk people and concierge were really helpful and just plain nice they got a crib into our room in record time when we called to ask why the heater was only blowing cool air they offered to send someone up right away when we explained that our son was already asleep and therefore we didnt want a repairman to come and wake him up they promised he would be very quiet i thought that was cute we still didnt take them up on the offer that night but he showed up the next morning anyway which was kind of nice
overall i really enjoyed staying here but would go somewhere else for breakfast",4.0
definitely recommended,nice little hotel with shuttle to and from the airport friendly staff clean rooms within walking distance to boston u medical center which was great highly recommended if youre coming to the area,4.0
i should have stayed here all week,the hotel was fantastic i had a junior suite on the 12th floor and it was huge by new york standards it was gigantic it was a little more space than i actually needed but i got a good rate through travelzoo and booked it for two of my 4 nights in nyc after checking in i felt as though i should have just stayed there for my entire visit to new york my other two nights in nyc were spent at my friends house  my junior suite was larger than her entire apartment so i can just imagine how spacious the 1  2 bedroom suites were all of the staff were very nice knowledgeable and extremely helpful it had a 24 hour drug store nearby which also had food items was close to the metro and walking distance to great shopping it was well laid out and had everything i needed and even more the room was very clean and well appointed too,5.0
very impressed with the hilton times square,we paid 406night for a deluxe room on the 35th floor in the nw corner with a view looking north towards midtown money well spent the staff were very friendly by ny standards the room was impeccably clean and nicely appointed and the view was spectacular even better the windows open rare in nyc so you can snap pictures of the city without an obstructing window this hotel is just off the times square crossroads and is actually quite peaceful and quiet if youre a hilton honors silver member you can check in early and check out late great hotel,5.0
great hotel  great location,"this is a very elegant hotel full of business travelers however they were hosting a wedding and reception the weekend i was there the rooms are quiet large and they were in the process of updating the decor 
the hotel is within walking distance of most everything georgetown barsrestaurants and shopping the waterfront dupont circle the kennedy center we even walked to the mall
the staff is very focused on customer service the restaurant is good but pricey free internet and fitness club access if you join the presidents club its free to join the fitness center is large and has much to offer
i would definitely stay there again",5.0
great location small rooms line for breakfast,you cant get a bettre location  upper west side next to broadway and half way between central park and riverside park 3 blocks from the subway plenty of greta stores and restaurants around the hotel was packed so we had to stand in line for breakfast  not fun the room was clean but small even for nyc stabdards overall  good value for a family trip,3.0
simply the best  5 dots are not enough,"we have just spent the most amazing 3 days at the st regis for my wifes 40th birthday i think it would be far to say that we are reasonably seasoned travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world but none of them come to close to the level of service we experienced at the st regis 
i think every hotel you stay in there is always something you could say wasnt up to scratch but it wont be worth complaining about because it is so insignificant if you go to the st regis you will have a funning feeling that you cant put your finger on because it takes a while to work out that everything in the hotel is done to perfection 
every member of staff is one step ahead of your every move without been intrusive and you are always greeted with a smile breakfast was wonderful room service was divine and the spa was out of this world the butler was excellent even with making tea at 530am jet lag and chambermaids made sure everything was spotless in the most amazing bedroom finally afternoon tea to die for 
if you want the best and to experience something no other hotel has very achieved for us anyway then splash out and go to the st regis",5.0
great location for nyc,"we stayed here for 5 nights from the 29th sept  4th october 2012 we booked one room for 4 adults
we found the hotel to be extremely well located we got the air train from jfk to jamaica followed by the lond island railroad to penn station and the hotel was 23 blocks fron penn really easy to find and brilliant access for the subwaystrains
we arrived early and our room was ready we were able to check in straight away the staff were very efficient and helpful our room was very clean and well stocked it was a bit of a squeeeze having 4 adults in so next time id book 2 seperate rooms the bathroom was very nice and great shower
we had to wait a day or so to get a safe deposit box as they were all full so thats my only real complaint but still very minor
i didnt experience any problems with the lifts if any staff were waiting for the lifts also they w ere very curteous and would let us take it first
the breakfast i thought was great just a buffet but a good selection of items from cereals breads pancakes cooked breakfast and fruit more than what you need to fill up to start your day we never really had a problem finding a seat althought i can imagine in real busy periods itd be a bugger
free internet access and printing services bargain stay here again sure i would we had a blast",4.0
good location ok hotel,"we spent 4 nights at this marriott the hotel is just an average marriott property it was clean we only encountered staff members at checkin and she was friendly the hotels location is great for shopping and dinning it is also an easy walk to beacon hill and the commons backbay subway stop is about a block from the hotels lobby making the hotel very accessible to all areas of boston 
although we didnt encounter any problems during our stay im not sure that i would stay here again there are many other hotels in boston in the same price range that are not only nicer but have staff that go out of their way to welcome you plus its location between two shopping malls does feel a little odd when you are in the lobby area and elevators",3.0
illegally charged credit card dont ever stay here,they had my credit card on file from a previous stay and illegally charged it at a later date months later and will not remove the charges the general manager lenard is rude and doesnt not handle customers very well i would not ever give this hotel your credit card information,1.0
old isnt always charming,"just back from denver hotel has a lovely lobby superb interior architecture and excellent room service however our room a signature king was tiny hard victorian chairs to sit in no double sinks or sitting area as promoted or wardrobe and a strange teeny closet noise from the lobby made its way to our 4th floor around the corner room which also faced the street the thermostat had to be repaired right off the bat but was attended to promptly i dont think it ever worked properly 
 if you like victoriana this is for you if you like modern comforts go elsewhere especially at the prices very disappointed with this hotel nothing like described on the website",3.0
rather decent,"the hotel has a great location next to the city trails bike run and the bat bridge as well it is right downtown and within walking distance of of 6th street barsrestaurants
the decor is decent overall the lobby is nice and they have an in house fridays and starbucks the fridays bar was not typical there was a lot of lighting due to the patio exterior glass walls that view out over the river
note there is no indoor pool as the hotelcom site said they only have an outdoor pool and no hot tub 
the best thing about the hotel is noted in my first paragraph the worst is that you are told not to park on the first 3 floors of the hotels connected garage  thats only for valet ok so if you are lucky enough to get the 4th floor then you have to take an elevator down cross through the lobby 50 yards to the other elevators that take you up to your room jeesh",4.0
james and chicago lovely,"we stayed at james at the beginning of a long trip along us for our first time in chicago
the hotel is as the city is elegant and full of design everything in the room has a sense and there are a lot of nice details stuffs to prepare a perfect martini yep in the room great kiehls products a giant lcd tv design cushions big mirror and more complimentary coffee machine and radiocdipod music device
good wifi internet access complimentary business center with pcs and macs i mean no charge for connecting to the internet or printing documents fully equipped gym
for breakfast lunch and dinner the hotels restaurant is really god but a little expensive
if i have to find something i didnt like i can say that the lobby could be better not the best way to welcome customers but it is really a little thing",4.0
i would do it again if i didnt have ears,"like a lot of the others here i was a little apprehensive after winning a room at this hotel on priceline but you know what it wasnt too bad
yeah the rooms are small sure the bathroom is lacking character and of course the location is dead come the weekend but the place is fine for a solo traveler for a couple of nights the only thing that would stop me recommending the hotel to a friend is the noise 
paper thin walls are an understatement thankfully my neighbors were quiet for the most part and i came prepared with some decent ear plugs to see me through the night
fix this problem and i would happily stay here when traveling solo again",3.0
always a pleasure,my husband and i have been staying at the lombardy between 1 and 2 times a year for the past 20 years i cant imagine why i have not written a review before this it is by our favorite hotel anywhere the location is perfect central to so many sights and attractions as well as bus and subway lines the staff are extraordinary many have been there for quite a long time the hotel is always spotless the beds very comfortable with comfortable pillows and a generous supply of towels whether we have stayed in a suite or a large double room the kitchenettes have been a big plus i highly recommend the lombardy for a business or pleasure stay in new york,5.0
great location  ok hotel,"stayed there for a 4day business trip the lobby is nice rooms are average  ok  but not even close to spectacular
i find that with nyc hotels its always a scary proposition since they are older buildings  a challenge to upgrade
i had a couple problems no washcloths and the tub was not draining properly which were fixed right away the maintenance and housekeeping staff were quite friendly
one other problem that i had were 2 bugs that i found in my sink  im convinced that they were cockroaches that came up through the drain i left the bathroom light on for the rest of my stay in hopes of detering them and kept the sink stopper closed
now maybe all nyc hotels have this issue  realistically how can they not but it was gross to me a country girl who does not encounter cockroaches in her daytoday life perhaps thats a normal thing in larger cities like nyc
i also found one other bug in the tub and another on my nightstand  not sure if they were the same kind i kept all my suitcases  bags tightly closed to avoid bringing them home",2.0
amazing room amazing location,we stayed here the night before the chicago marathon and everything was perfect our room had two beds and two separate bathrooms the service was perfect and the staff friendly and helpful considering how swamped they were the morning of the marathon they still delivered excellence service,5.0
excellent location for a car free traveler,"i stayed three nights at the wilshire crest hotel and liked it very much the room was big quiet i didnt notice any neighbor noises and dark at night it certainly wasnt fancythere wasnt even a radio and blessedly no minibar the furnishings are perfectly fine but not stylish the wilshire crest is a two story hotel with no elevator and there are no views to speak of although the orange st side looks out on a pleasant residential street theres free wireless internet unlikely some fancier places i stayed staff was helpful 
i almost never eat free hotel breakfasts they rarely seem to be much good and there are lots of good places close by for breakfast at 125 per night the money you save compared to other area hotels will fund your breakfast
there were a couple of hiccups the room door one room required some jiggling of the key to open the flush handle on the toilet was a little looseit worked ok but it should have been fixed and wasnt i actually stayed in two different rooms because there was a break in my stayboth were good
as previous reviewers have noted you can walk to a lot from herethe los angeles county museum of art and museum row the farmers marketgrove restaurants on 3rd st theres a strip mall with several restaurants a block away on wilshire blvdcafe latte is a very nice breakfastlunch place walkscorewhich rates how accessible stores and services are by walkinggives the wilshire crest a 97 out of 100 putting it in the top 2 of walkaccessible locations in the city of los angeles 
transit here is very good i stayed without a car with no problem wilshire boulevard has very frequent bus service west to beverly hills westwood ucla and santa monica and east to koreatown and downtown la wilshire  fairfax about a 5 minute walk away has a rapid bus stop and the rapids move along quite nicely fairfax ave has good bus service north to the fairfax commercial area if you dont feel like walking and hollywood there are also connections all along fairfax to eastwest bus routes like beverly blvd because the wilshire crest is very central to the visitororiented parts of la the travel times to these places are reasonable",5.0
very good experience,"the hotel is nicely renovated i was there with a group upon arrival the desk clerk was one of the best i have ever had he was friendly personable he recognized my diamond status and without prompting upgraded my room he wrote down additional information and his name if i had any problems superb as i looked for my room cleaners asked if i needed assistance
the rest of the visit most service was merely very good not at this great level but all the especially the front desk and doorman was high quality
the room was nice on the executive level the lounge was very good as well
on saturday night there was a movie room with popcorn a free reception friday evening i did not attend as i had a conflict
the lobby and sports bar were fine however they could not make high end drinks
the bed was a bit firm for my taste but comfortably appointed
as others have noted shower only no tub which is fine by me
one complaintthe eternal pet peeve of wired internet in the room costing 13day when will this end
good restaurants in the area",4.0

great experiencepillow heaven,i was told upon making the reservation that i had a room with a bath tub but apparently none of the doubles or queens do when i spoke to the reservation agent about it he indicated they would upgrade me to a king i thought this was a free upgrade it wasnt a major additional expensejust over ten dollars but i am on a budget and would at least have liked to be aware of this but i was given free internet access and they comped my toothbrush 15 from the honor bar so it evened out also there is an almost 20 per day city tax i was unaware of other than that we loved our stayevery person we encountered was nice and helpful my dog got a bed she loved i had more pillows than i knew what to do with and even ordered an additional one from their pillow menu as well as tao te ching from the spiritual menu overall a great experience even if it was a bit more expensive than id planned on thank you,4.0
fabulous romantic getaway,"my wife and i stayed her for 5 days if this hotel was not a boutique it would be a 412 star property the staff and service were tops the hotle had a cozy and warm feeling whoever did the interior decorating for both the hotel and restaurant should get some sort of industry award
the only drwarback is the location as it is on the border of the seedier part ot town howver this is more then compensated by the fact that you could walk to everything the major shops and stores theaters restaurants and bars and the trolly
i have stayed at many of the finest properties including ritzcarltons this property is a cousin
i definitely plan to stay here again",4.0
recent training held here,we recently held a two day training at this hotel  it was fantastic i was planning the training from michigan about a month prior to the actual training so i wasnt able to check out the site personally before arriving everyone was wonderful the planning prior to arrival went very smooth and everything was ready when we arrived the hotel staff was incredibly attentive and helpful the guest rooms were clean and very spacious the meeting room was fantastic and when we ran into some av trouble they made sure everything was working properly well before our meeting started they truly went above and behind to help make this a great training i didnt have to worry about anything it was close to the airport and not too far from the river walk the breakfast was by far the best weve had at a hotel everything was fantastic i would definitely reccommend it o anyone staying in the area the only slight downside was it was a little loud being so close to the freeway but nobody in our group had any trouble sleeping,4.0
great location  ok hotel,"the fairmont is a huge historic hotel in a great nob hill location you can walk to chinatown north beach and union square or take the cable car if the steep hill is too much even though we got a basic room at a great internet rate we ended up with gorgeous city views from our third floor room in the main building the lobby is beautiful and the room was nice for the most part
the bathroom was cramped and the toiletries were minimal and nothing special i was disappointed that there was no coffee maker in the room the free coffee in the lobby was put away at 700 am so if you got up later you had to go to the cafe in the hotel and pay for it our tvs reception was terrible it only got two or three stations we wanted to watch the olympics in the evening after dinner and that station got no reception whatsoever we requested that someone fix the tv and a technician was sent to our room right away everything worked fine when he was there but malfunctioned shortly thereafter a second person was sent to our room and he couldnt fix it either i eventually requested a new tv and that solved the problem 
only one concierge was available at any given time and there was often a line of people waiting for assistance i prefer not to wait ten or fifteen minutes for a quick question sometimes the bell staff were available to assist but they werent especially helpful for the information i needed
if you want to stay in a great location this hotel is a good bet other than that it felt kind of impersonal and the staff was just ok  nothing special",3.0
great place and location,the cosmopolitan hotel is a great place to stay for the weekend this is my second stay and it did not disappoint the hotel is clean and all of the staff is very helpful the rooms are small but since we didnt spend much time in our room it was ok we arrived early at 11am and were checked in immediately the location couldnt be better its within walking distance of battery park the brooklyn bridge and a quick subway ride to times square there is a lot of construction in the neighborhood but it did not distract us from anything,4.0
loved this marriott,i stayed at the j w marriott while in wasihngton dc for a conference the hotel is gorgeous and well located if you wish to be near the white house accommodations were wonderful and service was great the staff was friendly and helpful would definitely stay at this hotel on my next trip to washington dc,5.0
is there a choice for no circles,what was i thinking when i booked this room what was supposed to be a new years eve celebration in new york turned into a whole lot of lost cash as a result of this place from the leaking toilet and sink to the falling apart shower to the burn and moth holes in the sheets and comforter to the lack of a blanket on the bed did i mention this was new years eve cold to the friendly cockroach staring at me when i flipped the bathroom light switch which by the way was overlapping the nongrounded electrical plug and while i was standing in a pool of water from the leaking toilet and sink faucet i mentioned earlierhalf an inch to the right and i would have had a free perm i dont know about you but once i see a cockroach i want out if there is one there are thousands those things have friends of course the policy that they never explain when you check in is that you must complain within a half hour or you can not receive a refundand even if you do request one in time then they point to the bottom of your receipt which reads absolutely no refunds with conditions like these it is no wonder they ask you to pay up before your stay no one would ever stay dont get caught in this trap the internet site makes it look ok but i think that may be the owners room they show as no other room looks as nice for an extra couple bucks you can stay somewhere much nicer and cleanerwithout the extra roomies,1.0

one time stay only,unfortunately i cancelled a reservation to paramount hotel in search of a hotel closer downtown i cancelled max hotel for something better but then lots of hotels were booked so it was a choice of this hotel silvere cloud i lake union or silver cloud in broadway so i opted for a boutique hotel what a mistake limited front desk personnel required a 15 minute wait the first time to check in and the other time to complain about garbage of food piled up on top of garbage can outside of our room most important complain would have to be the most uncomfortable bed which brought my husband and i with extreme back pain every morning the flat pillows offered no cushion the limited tv channels did not distract us from the discomfort we asked to check out after the first day but were told we had a prepaid plan which seemed rather odd because i made the reservations from their own websiteanyways they did roll over a fridge and microwave fit for a frat house or dormno dresser for clothes to store in so i lived off my suitcase for the next 5 days the bathroom was clean and did provide hot water the view was fantastic but the drive downtown was too far this was not the right decision for us lesson learned we are already booked at the westin in november for the same price this hotel needs to upgrade their customer service and amenities to charge the same price as their downtown 5 star counterpartsits a good thing seattle itself was worth the trip,2.0
really nice hotel and great location,"really good hotel in the heart of san francisco  its a great base for a visit and good value too the complementary breakfast is very good and the cheese and wine set out in the afternoon is a really nice touch its also a good way to meet other guests and to pick up tips on places to go

amazing roof deck views and enormous suites,the staff of this small hotel were very responsive and professional i stayed for about 5 nights while in town for a conference the location is great  scenic and walkable area moments from great restaurants shops museums and the market i had a duplex suite with a kitchenette a huge livingdining room and 2nd floor ensuite bedroom there was enough room for a family though mine were not with me and plenty of room to have colleagues over for a drink without feeling like you were entertaining in your bedroom furnishings were tasteful and modern two large tvs and bath luxurious the shared roof terrace is a great bonus  colleagues and i shared a bottle of wine and watched the view for hours the only downside was the extra scrutiny my expense report received after my bosses saw my posh digs they stayed at the marriott waterfront in standard rooms for the same price one final note  if you are staying anywhere in seattle try to get a fridge and coffeee maker if not a full kitchen so that you can try out the amazing produce coffees and cheeses and bakery items that area available at the marketplace and be sure to pick up a giant bouquet of fresh flowers for 515 what a treat,5.0
really quite nice,booked this hotel for an overnight stay based on other ta reviews with a bright and spacious hotel lobby and lively bar the front desk was friendly and quick the room was a king bed suite with modern furniture there was a dressing area a beautiful clean spacious bathroom living room complete with a lcd tv with french doors that closed off the bedroom which also had a lcd tvthe king bedmattress was a bit odd as if there was a mound in the center of the bed with it sloping off to the edges of the mattress which were hard there was a only comforter no flat sheet it got quite warm using a comforter in spring we ate breakfast in the hotel in the morning buffet is a bit pricey  19 a pop which after doing the math was a better deal than ordering items a la carte server was attentive and friendly valet parking was helpful and friendly but pricey at 30 which was included in our package even the housekeeper who was cleaning the room across from ours was friendly i would stay here again most definitely,4.0
wonderful honeymoon stay at yotel,great hotel modern and close to times square loved how fast and easy checkin and checkout was friendly staff very helpful and efficient my new husband and i would definitely stay there again only thing was the mattress of our standard cabin was a bit hard for our liking but we were still able to have 4 great nights sleep,5.0
even my teen age son was was impressed  great job selecting the hotel dad,"i had a free night at any hyatt from a promotion during the spring so i used it for a onenight stay on a college visit to chicago with my teenage son we were able to confirm only a two twin bed room but were advised to request two doubles at checkin we arrived early around 9am expecting to check our luggage despite being sold out on doubles they checked for two rooms both with doubles and said we could check in soon after about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready we went to the room which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of lake michigan down the street two double beds a huge bathroom with two sinks a separate toilet room an oversized bathtub with a handheld shower head and a separate shower room with a raintype wall mounted shower about 8 up and a separate handheld the door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed i couldnt believe that we had been given a tworoom suite so i called the front desk to check i was put on hold but got no response so i called back after a few minutes they first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room but when i explained that i was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that i had reserved only one room i locked the connecting doors myself
the room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting flat screen tv ipod dock one robe but two pairs of slippers in the closet two toothbrushes and toothpaste iron ironing board shoeshine machine hairdryer safe etc minibar jars of nuts 3 kinds bottles of imported sparking water basket of apples i assume that only the apples were complimentary though the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turndown service  i guess they really wanted us to buy them extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman glass desk with chair and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate complimentary internet access  wired and wireless although the latter worked for my son it didnt for me there was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked internet cable in one of the drawers
we checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel i asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure no problem we didnt need to keep our keys because there was open access we returned around 430 pm and went to the pool locker room had fullsized lockers stocked with robes and slippers towels were piles on a rack keys were in the unused lockers shampoo conditioner shower gel lotion shaving cream razors etc all available two shower rooms one equipped for handicapped large steam room three or four lane lap pool with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day we went to the airport and arrived home late tired and relaxed our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip
i didnt rate value because our room was complimentary we really appreciated not being treated like second class citizens in any way  the service was first rate from everyone we encountered my only two admittedly minor suggestions would be to replace the towels with more fluffy ones  the ones we had were somewhat thin  and to add a mirror in the bedroom  the only mirrors were in the bathroom
my sons telling me that i did a great job in selecting this hotel  priceless",5.0
update on my october review,we were looking forward to our stay but were very disappointed with the overall experience we had booked and prepaid for a superior king room and when we got to our room it was a tiny standard room i called the front desk to let them know they made a mistake they fessed up to the error and offered us another room an hour later we finally got our room and we were absolutely mortified to see that the room had no view but overlooked an old ugly roof i was tired of complaning so i just gave up and took the room i regret doing that to this day the staff are snobby and seems like this place catered more to out of town business people so red flag do not stay here to relax or vacation the entire lobby is dark with very dim lighting like a club the bar and food are overpriced for what you get we will continue to stay at our favorite hotel the st francis westin they have huge rooms and great restaurants and the staff are friendlier,3.0
goodwhich is typical for es,weve now stayed at all 3 embassy suites in dc and can recommend all of them this one was the most recent i was a little worried because this one is on the eastern side of town which is considered the edge by some people we had no problems and this location is actually very close to the touristy stuff the breakfast is excellent which is typical for es and free drinks at happy hour are hard to beat seriously those to things probably save you 2535 bucks a day for each person staying breakfast and cocktails are not cheap in cities the breakfast selections were numerousfrom hardboiled eggs yogurt and fruit to a full hot breakfast buffet along with madetoorder omelets we also thought that every employee was polite and helpful the valet parking was expensive but thats just kinda the way cities are i guess cant figure a way around it the room itself was spacious enough that when you hang out there for a while you dont have that trapped feeling also theyre all suites so if one person wants to go to bed and the other wants to watch espn for a while its fine room was clean had a fridge microwave couch chairs table and chairs etc only downside was you could hear some noise from adjoining rooms such as running water doors closingwasnt terrible but the plumbing noises were pronounced the only other thing i wish they had was some type of noisemaker like a bathroom fan wall fan or something it would help mask the noises of the city on the street below i dont know why more hotels dont offer this feature they need to realize that people use fans for things other than ventilation and lastly weve found that on weekends you can get a room at these embassy suites for two nights for about the same price as one night dont know why but thats a hard deal to beat,4.0
reluctant to share this review because we are afraid we will not be able to get a reservation for the next time we visit,"we found this place on trip advisor and could not have been more pleasantly surprised with this inn and its sister property the white swan first of all the location was perfect situated just outside of union square the hotel is in a great spot for walking to many restaurants bars and shops as well the cable car is a short block away reception was friendly with home baked cookies and a bowl of fruit in the lobby complimentary water and soft drinks were also readily available we arrived in time for the afternoon wine and hors doeuvre which were lovely our first room was acceptable although tiny we stayed the first night but because we were carrying extra luggage to attend a wedding we did not have enough space and requested a room change 
we were moved to the white swan their sister property and treated with the same warmth and amenities our room there was fantastic a gas fireplace dressing room and wet bar for a small upcharge this was clearly our fault for reserving badly we could have spent a month in the second room which was great",5.0
like marmite  youll either love it or hate it,"this is certainly not a dull place to stay  on the positive side the location is excellent situated close to the beverly hills center the hotel offered an excellent valent parking service and there was an interestingly framed roof top pool serving superb food with very attentive and friendly staff the rooms were a good size the linen wonderful and the bathrooms large if somewhat bizzare in design there was also a well equiped fitness centre
on the negative the hotel concept was definitely a case of design over functionality  as with the hudson in new york guests should be provided with a flashlighttorch to navigate this hotel as lighting does not appear to be top of phillippe starcks priority list and why would anyone place a pool table in a communal area on each and every floor unless hotel management was actively encouraging its guests to stay up all night  in which case this was an unnecessary step as the noise from the lobby partybar was more than sufficient the reception staff had a problem understanding that they were the ones supposed to be serving the guests rather than the other way round and the roof top pool should be avoided at the weekend unless you are a would be starlet auditioning for lolita the bedrooms lacked lighting and storage was sufficient only for those packing size zero clothing and going commando
that said if you are looking for a party hotel to hang out with the beautiful people then this is the place for you overall we enjoyed our stay mainly as there was an amusing incident lurking behind every doorway but horses for courses as they say and this was probably just not a hotel for this particular filly would i recommend this hotel to friends  well if they could get a good rate left their children at home and promised to pack a sense of humour then probably yes",3.0
very clean friendly staff,i had friends that warned us that the hotel was far away from the center of the city and in a bad area but we found the hotel to be very convenient and in a perfectly nice area so close to the metro the staff could not have been nicer and it was very very clean the pool was spotless and the breakfast was terrific overall maybe not the ritz but a great quality hotel,4.0
good central location comfortable rooms free breakfast,"i stayed at the staybridge times square at the end of august 2012 for 7 nights
on arrival the hotel receptionist was very cheery and efficiant was allocated a room with a view on the 29th floor
room was a decent size double bed desk large flatscreen tv chair kitchenette fridge freezer hob microwave dish washer coffee maker utensils etc bathroom had sink and a large shower walkin shower
the hotel lifts are very fast but with 32 floors and only 3 lifts we did have to wait a couple of minutes at peak times but never more than a couple of minutes
the included breakfast had a good selection and was good quality it usually had 2 choices of cereal bread bagels muffins danish juice coffee oatmeal fresh fruit as well as hot choices the dining area was busy but we always manage to get a table easily
the hotel also offers a free managers reception 3 nights per week with free food  drinks sodas wine beer
the hotel is in hells kitchen right next to the port authority bus depot so it was really handy for getting around only a couple of minutes walk to the nearest metro line
it always felt safe walking around the area day or night
there are a good selection of reasonable restaurants 50th  9th and delis in the area
this was our sencond time at the hotel we previously stayed 2 years ago nothing has changed its still as good as it was then i would have no issue recommending the hotel to anyone",5.0
overpriced and extremely disapointed,"i regret booking this place but not that i could help it it was booked for us through hotwirecom dont let the 4 star hotel line trick you here 
1 more like 25 or 3 star hotel
2 holiday inns have been better
3 rooms were small anyview of the city was obstructed
4 shower head in the bathroom were almost falling out from the walls
5 lobbys hallways and elevators were from the 20 30 years ago 
6 service at the concierge was terrible offered no help or suggestion was not knowelgeable at all even to resturants in the hotel
7 parking was 25 a day ended up to be not so much of a bargain after all
8 pictures on thier homesite was mislead not anything close to the reality
9 3 words dont go here there are soooo many other places in downtown la",1.0
absolutely perfect,i attended a family reunion in baltimore however we were staying near the airport i wanted to experiene the city since ive nevery been before so i came in a day earlier and stayed overnight at the hyatt regency because i wanted to be closer to the inner harbor i was solo and i was extremely pleased with my choice the location was perfect including a skywalk to the mall and my hotel room was very beautiful clean and nice cityharbor view checkin was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful if youre looking for an indoor pool sorry not happening and the outside pool was remote and not very friendly for a solo guest however i did enjoy the fitness room and the restaurant i loved that the location was close to the city free shuttle bus and 3 blks from camden yards and the light rail actually i took the light rail from the airport would recommend to my family and friends cant wait to go back,5.0
great location,this hotel provided us with a great locationwe could walk just about to most locations that we wanted to seethere are no views from this hotel but youre not in the room long enough to worry about viewsthe employees were all very gracious and very helpful with advice on where locations were and how to get therethe various gentlemen at the consierge desk were most informative and helpfulwe didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on the food but plenty of great places within walking distance,4.0
okay but definitely not great,this hotel was okay i guess i was hoping for better though the location was good and the staff was nice they suggested a few restaurants to us and held our bags free of charge after we checked out before our bus left but the rooms are very outdated on my first night there the heater broke and i had to move to a different room and further more i didnt have time to move my stuff to a new room at the time i was getting ready to go somewhere but they told me that i had to be out of my current room in the next 2 hours in my next room the tv made a very loud buzzing sound every time it was turned on all in all i was satisfied with my stay there but a bit disappointed it was one of the cheaper hotels i could find but if i were to return to chicago i would probably not stay there again you could probably find a nicer hotel in that area of town for only a slightly higher price,3.0
another wonderful stay at a top notch well located hotel,the magnolia is such a wonderful getaway destination staff is incredibly helpful and attentive great location tucked away in downtown convenient to nightlife venues quaint hotel my husband and i were in the area for the evening from a nearby city for a company dinner and the magnolia was the prefect place for us to start and end our great evening together the fireplace in the entry is amazingly inviting,5.0
good hotel for the business and turistic trip,nice hotel very close to white house rooms are clean ac is quite quiet price is ok for this locaion it was a fire alarm in the night but staff worked promptly and clear recommend this hotel for the business trip in washington dc,5.0
a great place near the airport,"my wife and i had to go to charlotte for a few days early december 2011 and tried to pick a place near the hotel for ease of travel our fears of a dingy cramped unfriendly hotel room were pleasantly shattered within the first few minutes of arriving early 
the staff was so friendly since we caught an earlier flight we figured wed be out of luck checking in many hours early to our surprise they quickly accommodated us and even offered us to eat at their breakfast counter gratis when we got into the room it was clean spacious and well appointed for a room costing less then 100 per day 
a pool and spa were offered for use as part of the price although we didnt use them breakfast was included as was free parking overall this hotel was the best bang for the buck and left us with no hesitation in saying wed absolutely stay there again when in charlotte",5.0
fantastic location beautiful city views,"i loved my stay at this hotel the staff was so welcoming and hospitable really made my stay lovely the rooms were quite large and really enjoyed the spacious bathroom we had a balcony that overlooked japantown and it was gorgeous really enjoyed the personal snack bar tea kettle for making tea and the relaxing environment 
i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who loves a cozy room great hospitality and culture its very close to fantastic japanese food especially benihana my favorite restaurant when visiting japantown",5.0
a gem of a hotel,"stayed here for 3 nights and everything was perfect the room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable best of all was the bathroom  clean well lighted and bright and with all necessary amenities
front desk staff were friendly and helpful and service was impeccable i had a minor problem with the tv and the problem was sorted out within 15 minutes complimentary wireless internet worked flawlessly
location is great  just a couple of blocks from union square with lots of eating places and shops
will definitely stay here again on my next trip to san francisco",5.0
small but still nice,if youre considering the pod its probably because you want to find something affordable with that in mind the pod is a good choice the location is good and there are plenty of places nearby where you can buy food and get a nice breakfast the rooms are small but when in ny you probably dont wanna spend too much time at the hotel room anyway theres no luxory here but it provides what you need if youre on a budget,3.0
clean comfortable great hotel,stayed there in may of 2oo7 while we were on vacation from massachusetts we had the jr king suite the bed was very comfortable bathroom was clean  always well stocked wtowels  such nice views to downtown dallas pool is kind of small although not crowded parking is average room service is expensive though but im assuming thats all hotels i would def stay there again,5.0
beautiful hotel wonderful staff small room notsogreat restaurant,we are definitely not high society but my sister and i were traveling through sf and decided to try a boutique hotel from the time our car arrived at the front door the service was beyond reproach the valet treated our honda pilot as if it were a bmw they were personable friendly and helpful even retrieved our coats from the car after it had been parked the front desk was also personable and very helpful and we did ask a lot of questions the hotel decor was absolutely beautiful our room was also beautiful very clean but very small very small the only flyintheointment was the mediocre restaurant the grand cafe the cafe decor was beautiful the waitstaff friendly and helpful but the most important ingredient is the food and it was very bland to put it kindly for breakfast i had the quiche and my sister had the burrito the quiche had the texture of and tasted like egg beaters with a tough crust my sister also commented on the bland taste of her dish since everything else had been top notch we went into the restaurant expecting excellence never thinking to check the cafes ratings big mistake costly mistake i would never choose to eat here and that takes away a star from the hotel overall,4.0
just okay but there arent better options around,"given the price of the hotels in san francisco rex hotel is a reasonable option for under 200
the main reason for choosing this hotel was its location one block away from union square also the staff was friendly enough
the rooms are recently renovated but the hotel is a bit outdated slow elevator and old carpet
i would give this a lower rating because you normally get more in other places for what you pay here but i didnt really find much better options in san francisco
the free wifi was very good",4.0
fun stylish hotel in the heart of the action,very new hotel 3 years old apparently that is right at the entrance to the gaslamp district the hotel was overall an amazing experience stayed for 4 days during a conference and had a blast experience has definitely changed my perspective on hard rock hotels and will now be looking for them to stay at in other cities amazing modern hotel very clean very fun party atmosphere we had the most basic room you could get and were still very pleased overall give it high marks with the exception of sleep quality the reason i rated sleep quality very low is due to the proximity to the train tracks brutally close to passenger and freight trains who blow their horn regularly throughout the evening and our room was right above bar 207 in the hotel which turns into a night club base was so loud that it would shake the room until 2 am that being said you get what you pay for as we got a great deal on the hotel so cannot complain would definitely recommend to others seeking a cool hotel in a great location gaslamp district is amazing,4.0
great location,"i recently stayed here for business and enjoyed the location and the access to the mac gym connected to the hotel when i first checked in i was put in a tiny room where i could barely get around the bed i called downstairs and they moved me to a much bigger room with a better view
the only things that kept me from giving this hotel 5 stars were the parking situation and the breakfast parking isnt easy and even getting to the valet parking area can take a long time i did like the ability to text for your car 
the breakfast was just ok while it had some of the usual amenities of an hgi breakfast it lacked some quality the potatoes and bacon seemed to be the same frozen and tasteless kind found at the hampton inn and homewood suites this may be the case because the hgi and homewood suites are right next to each other so i am guessing they share more than just staff and some amenities this disappointed me a little bit because one of the things i like about hgi is the highquality breakfast if i wanted the lower quality one i would have booked at a hampton or homewood
overall this was a very nice place to stay for a multiday business trip everyone was friendly and there are lots of great restaurants and places to shop nearby",4.0
great location,"unless you like the younger crowd of fishermans wharf then union square is right in the centre of things in sf and the handlery is just 20 yards off the square
we found all the staff very helpful and seemingly happy to be there
we upgraded on checkin to one of the newer rooms around the pool 201 i think and it was large well appointed and comfortable the decor was modern in the bedroom the only complaint i could have if being picky was the shower bath thing ive never understood the point of putting a tiny bath im talking about 40inches long and then putting a shower above it with a curtain just put a shower unit there apart from that small point the room was great and had everything we needed including a coffee machine hair dryer and iron
location really couldnt have been better with just short walks to chinatown the art galleries and trams  buses to all the piers and wharves
if you get breakfast vouchers when you check in walk around the right of the counter and into the daily grill to make a reservation for the next morning which will save you a 15 minute wait for a table there are 3 included breakfast options and we tried all of them and were happy with them all",5.0
great location  free breakfast,although there are many hotels in the fishermans wharf area we chose this hotel because we really like the holiday inn express chain and have stayed in many throughout the us besides the great location i guess the biggest draw would be their incredible free breakfast  not just the standard cereals but scrambed eggs bacon etc considering we found the restaurants in the area to be fairly expensive this was definitely a money saver and a nice way to start the day as to be expected though the eating area was always very crowded our minisuite was somewhat disappointing rather small compared to others in the express chain weve stayed at at night the room was quiet even though the daytime traffic was noisy service was friendly all in all a very nice hotel a tip for riding the cable car at the turnaround near the hotel  we went later on in the day and there was hardly a wait also wed recommend the night tour at alcatraz booking online well in advance is a real convenience,5.0
simply lovely 5s,i must say i was extremly pleased with the staff and the delicious breakfast and lunch i was served upon my lovely stay i would highly recommend this rennaisance hotel for a beautiful and not to mention enjoyable and relaxing stay,5.0
a nice place to stay,a quiet place to stay outside of downtown in close proximity to u of w and good shopping and resteraunts free parking and not too expensive,4.0
excelletn place to stay when playing downtown,location is the key here room was a little above average lobby very nice but if you want a nice place to stay just steps from the downtown action of the clubs it is perfect staff was very helpful even helped with a billing dispute in a professional manner only drawbackdriveway can be very crowded particularly at checkout a minor inconvenience not a dela breaker,4.0
outstanding resort,"we went for a few days in late may we arrived on memorial day and the place was packed until late afternoon  the rest of the week the place was empty and it was fabulous rooms are nice and well kept food is overpriced and not much of a value 
pool was huge with plenty of chairs adult only pool was a nice add on 3 watersides and lazy river were fun but resort needs time to grown some shade kids will love this place there are smores activities and an arcade get a pool view room if possiblecan be a bit loud at night but the views are great and in the afternoon shade
 played both golf courses the oaks course is your typical overrated greg norman design not very memorable and very cheeky good shots punished also the dye course is more picturesque a bit easier if you play well tougher if you do not
would not recommend going at memorial day fourth of july or labor day  crowds are not worth it",4.0
a terrific time in manhattan,we stayed at the edison hotel because it was close to times square and broadway i will definitely stay there again anytime i travel to nyk the location was perfect the lobby really nice the attached sofia ristorante was delicious and the staff there is great we even went downstairs to club cachegreat treat,5.0
solid new york option,i have stayed here numerous times and theres a lot to like about this hotel its centrally located very handy for meetings in midtown and for hitting the shops on 5th avenue i struggled a bit with service this trip though staff on the front desk werent as fabulous as they have been on past visits  and in some cases were downright surly im looking at you nancy my superior king room was well appointed and a great size id stay here again but it would be nice to have friendlier and more helpful staff on the front desk concierge had a couple of shockers with restaurant suggestions but seemed genuinely contrite and eventually redeemed themselves,3.0
great location,"this hotel is in the best location near union sqaure the people that work at the hotel are really nice and helpfull the room is clean but if you are in the front on the street side you need earplugs so maybe ask for a room that is at the back 
 also something you have to keep in mind is that our room had a really hard bed this is ofcourse very personal but after three night i was happy to sleep in a different bed
overall this is a very good hotel you get good value for your money",4.0
shabby and disappointing  old in a bad way,"the adolphus hotel refers to itself as dallas luxury and i find that misleading to out of town guests dallas has much more to offer the lobby is beautiful old world and happening  we saw a number of activities take place during our short stay a formal auction a red hat society tea party and the remains of the christmas parade but once you leave the lobby it is obvious that less attention is given to the suites the wallpaper in the hallways were peeling the furniture was squashy and the carpet was clearly quite old and out of style our overnight stay was very disappointing everything in the room was old in a bad way  the chairs were stained the lamp shades were beaten in the carpet was mashed and peeling up along the edges and the bed was surprisingly terrible to sleep in  the pillows smashed down to nothing and the king sized mattress was lumpy rickety and not supportive at all the bathroom was very disappointing olive colored toilets and bathtubs with non polished brass fixtures and soap holders the hospitality area was a cubby etched out of the wall with the oldest locking refrigerator id ever seen old candy and breakfast bars and a bifold door with chipped paint i feel confident that the rooms have not been redone since the late eighties looking at the window coverings and carpet 
we planned to order breakfastinbed but quite frankly didnt want to spend anymore time in the bed or the suite for that matter so we checked out of our romantic weekend early the staff were very helpful and kind but it was also clear that they were a bit understaffed as the registration table on a sunday morning was backed up and the car lot was a mess ive had worse stays in a super8 along the highway but ive never had as bad as stay for what we paid as much as i like to support dallass history i say spend your money elsewhere and enjoy your evening",2.0
had a great time,"great hotel the staff were great with our young children 3  5  leaving gifts every now and again they gave a away free ice cream to the kids also complimentary wine to guests every evening room was very clean but it was small the only negative really location is greatright outside the entrance to china town and a block away from union square and all the big label stores inc macys
if were ever in san fran again well definitely stay there again",5.0
great stay in ny,weve had good luck with la quintas elsewhere in the us so my family decided to try manhattan location we were pleasantly surprised with our stay first and most importantly the room was very large by ny standards with additional space not near the beds there were five of us so that was very welcome the room was clean and everything worked well save for the inconsistent shower temps we were on the 12th floor where it was quiet and we had an awesome view of the empire state building the breakfast was great as was the location the price wasnt cheap but fair given the location we would stay there again get a courtyard view,5.0
out of date smelly cheap small cute pool staff average,"on arrival i thought it was a retro art deco hotel but quickly realised it just hasnt been modernised 
it was clean although the hall to level 2 where we were absolutely stank a kind of weird old musky smell the room equally stank but you quickly dont notice it
the room is clean good shower room the balcony is overlooked by everybody in a tiny courtyard so you cant sunbathe and also you hear everybodys phone calls etc really loud
the fountain in the courtyard is turned on all night long so you can hear it all the time
the bed sheets looked clean but stank of mens bo i didnt notice until the first night i didnt say anything because i was sure theyd be changed but no this went on the entire holiday too afraid to complain i put up with the smell
breakfast was ok i suppose nothing groundbreaking if you dont like eggs youre screwed the toaster took an age to toast and even then to a poor standard literally ten minutes waiting for bread to pop up warm bread
the staff were mixed the breakfast staff and cleaners were fab 
we had amazing directions from one of the receptionists the other guy who i can only describe as being the human version of peter griffin from family guy picked his nose through the entire check in
he managed to keep a straight face while charging us 90 for a small amount of phone calls due to our mobile being lost at universal studios he also kept a straight face while asking for 65 for a taxi to the airport too
the check out day is what has made me very angry we have to check out by 11am and our plane to the uk was 8pm we were allowed to store our bags and use the pool so by 3pm when we come to leave we needed showers we were told no we were given the use of me washroom only i asked for a towel and was offered a paper napkin i explained we had a ten hour flight ahead of us and needed to freshen up her response was only registered guests can use our towels we had been there a week and funded their pension by this time they couldnt even loan us a towel
a final insult is the taxi company they booked to collect us are dishonest
as the driver pulled out of lax after dropping us i realised id left a wedge of nots in the car about 60 i called the hotel who called the taxi company they called back to say he looked but nothing i misted he come back over half hour later where had he been he returned and surprise surprise nothing
interestingly without any indication from me he got out of the cab and went straight to where i left it and pointed and said see nothing
absolute thief 
not happy with the hotel once we had checked out they treated us like traps off the street i wont be going back",2.0
extremely freindly staff,"we booked the hotel for one week on tripadvisor reviews
we were not disappointed the room was clean large enough and quiet
the staff was extremely helpful whenever we needed any help
we will definitely stay there again
thank you for making our stay in ny so pleasant",5.0
comfortable stay,i had a nice sized room which was clean and not furnished with too much furniture in a small space like most hotels service was unobtrussive and room service was very good the staff was freindly and helpful upon arrival and the lobby area was lively and upbeat i would say the only drawback is any noise from the hallway can be heard pretty clearly through the door so if you get a room near the elevator areas on any floor it can be noisy,4.0
good family hotel,we enjoyed our stay at this hotel it has a good location and helpful staff the breakfast buffet had good choices and the staff were friendly especially connie who always made us smile the pool was nice but no hot tub,4.0
good value and location clean a bit noisy,i thought that the hotel exceeded my expectations for the price i paid the room and bathroom were clean the tv was modern and the locationviews were great i faced downtown so wasnt expecting much but it was a cool city view with a little balcony staff was very friendly was able to walk around little italy a bit of the gaslamp district and of course along the harbor internet was fast and the free shuttle to the airport was a big factor in why i chose to stay here only complaints are that there were no free breakfast items not that they misled i just assumed there would be and it was a bit noisy walls were a little thin so i could hear my neighbors intermittently and the street below was loud enough to wake me up one night out of three i enjoyed my stay enough though that i added an extra night onto my stay when alternate plans fell through,4.0
sfd does not stand for sir francis drake ,"sfd stands for sorry  dump  the room was tiny the bathroom was a small closet the air conditioner was broke couldnt be fixed and no other option they said they would send a fan up  never showed up no offer to change rooms  nothing  total lack of concern the walls in the room were marked and scuffed up the ceiling had water damage street noise was awful all the money spent on this place goes to furnish the lobby and pay the fancy guy on the street very disappointing experience
it is a good location the restaurant across the street  sears is a great place to eat eddie our waiter was fabulous
do not stay here unless you want to be disappointed i would rate it lower but you cant select a negative number enjoy san fran from another location",1.0
great view great location,i thought this was a great hotel when i got there with my family they by accidently put us in a smoking room which is what we didnt ask for we asked to be moved and theymoved us to a nicer room for the same price which i thought was great they were very friendly and helpful we also had a great view of central park and we were a 1 minute walk away from 5th avenue i will defeintley go back,5.0
great lobby rooms not as nice better values elsewhere,there is nothing wrong with this hotel but the lobby is the best feature once you are checked in the rooms are far from special and in fact on the small side as with a lot of city hotels everything costs a premium that in this case is not warranted there are better deals to be had in the area and more historic and nicer hotels for the price range i generally look to hilton properties first but this didnt do much for me not bad not horrible just pretty average i will say that i got a great haircut in spa fusion and would recommend that i might go back there to get a haircut next time in town but ill stay elsewhere,3.0
great place to stay,"overall a great hotel our room was a good size looking right into camden yards room was clean and staff was super friendly and helpful even though there were tons of kids in the hotel we were not disturbed at all 
my tiny complaint is that the bathroom didnt allow a place to hang towels so they could be reused being ecofriendly and only staying for 2 nights i didnt really need new towels but there was no place besides back of door which didnt fit 2 towels or allow them to dry to hang the towels a towel rack is really all i can say that would have added to my overall experience
overall a great stay",5.0
excellent place to stay,we spent two days in memphis on our way to mardi gras in nola we had not made an advance reservation electing to find a place once we got to memphis most of the downtown hotels were booked and we went to the comfort only to find one small room available they were kind enough to call their sister hotel the sleep inn only a block away and got a room for us it was a beautiful room with a very comfortable bed and my husband loved the location near the trolley the trolley stopped behind our hotel and we loved riding down to beale st and sight seeing on the trolley we were within walking distance to a great cafe recommended by the staff the blue plate and enjoyed breakfast there instead of the continental at the hotel this hotel is newly renovated and is awesome the staff was wonderful too we got our room for 99 and it was comparable to the 149 room we stayed in at a new hampton in wisconsin last year this was our first stay at a sleep inn but it wont be our last we booked while we were there for the bbq festival in may we go through memphis once or twice a year and usually stay on the outskirts of town but we wont anymore this is a jewel,5.0

the only choice,"no need to even think twice about booking here its a great experience bar none
we just returned from a fourday stay and could not have been happier the hotel itself is located in a business park thats close to all attractions and freeways but devoid of noise and traffic the grounds are immaculate and the rooms are too in addition to an exceedingly friendly and efficient staff this hotel offers free internet access complimentary drinks and free breakfast overall its a terrific place to stay and comes highly recommended we will definitely be back",5.0
central and very economical,"this is a very central inn located in the university area with great staff the king room we had was quiet spacious sweetsmelling comfortable bed and very reasonably priced including free parking and wifi its within walking distance of the shopping mall where there are great places to eat and handy for driving to pike place market or to the football game which is why we were there they also have a free shuttle to the uni ave if youre so inclined and provide a decent little grabngo breakfast 
all in all id say it was worth way more than we paid in comparison with those downtown places that charge 35 a night for parking highly recommended",4.0
my new home before 5am flights,this is a great location it was a two minute walk to the terminal from the front door of the hotel we did not get to use many facilities due to our early morning flight but the pianos bar was a lot of fun,5.0
good location if you like bats,"this hotel is located on lady bird lake in austin and a two minute walk from the famous congress st bridge which is home to hundreds of thousands of bats their departure every evening is spectacular to watch
the food is very good here with a delicious breakfast buffet and a nice lunch menu as well while the room was ok we found the air conditioning to be noisy and we never could get the room cool enough to be as comfortable as we like it
the staff overall was very attentive and helpful",3.0
not quite what i expected,booked this hotel based on its close location to benroya hall while the hotel and lobby are beautiful the rooms leave a lot to be desired for a 45 star hotel our room was small and the furniture looked outdated the amenities were fine soap shampooconditioner etc but our bath robes were a mess one had a giant hole in the arm and the other was frayed at the sleeves it was also difficult to get a good nights sleep because you could hear so much noise from the street old windows on the positive side the service at the hotel is outstanding and the lobby lounge is great,3.0
adult family vacation exceeded expectations,"my family of 5 adults stayed here toward the end of june for 6 days we were very pleased with the location of the hotel which was in walking distance to all the attractions of fishermans wharf and public transportation 
the concierge helped us learn the public transportation system and gave us explicit directions on how to get to certain places we also went to a baseball game while staying and they informed us that the game time changed from 7pm to 1pm  without them telling us we would have missed our game
edita was awesome at checking us in i personally arrived a day before my family and she let me pick out rooms that i thought would work best we had a great view out of rooms and my parents were able to stay in a connecting room next door
the fitness center was very nice except it was extremely small which was a downside in the mornings you couldnt fit more than 6 people in there without being crammed also the pool area was very nice just not a lot of chaise lounge chairs maybe 10 at most
one downside was the hotel was very very busy which we never did get a chance to sit outside near one of the fire pits at times the lobby area was so packed that it drove us nuts another downside was the beds they were not very comfortable i could feel springs in my back when laying on it i tried other beds and they were all the same 
other than that the hotel is fantastic the staff was awesome and friendly and i would definitely suggest staying here",4.0
great retreat from the craziness of n y city,"we were very pleased with this hampton inn new york is a busy tiring city and coming back to this hotel at the end of the day was always welcomed the breakfasts were great free tea and coffee all day and computers available in the lobby as well the room itself was more than adequate nice bathroom and shower and good hair dryer the staff were all very helpful too
i didnt think the n y pass for 2 days was worth the money theres no way you can fit enough sites in to get your moneys worth also the blue hop on hop off bus wasnt very good either id reccomend seeiing the sites at your own pace we didnt encounter too many queues even on the sunday over all a great trip tho",5.0
great hotel,across the street from some night life and walking distance to other great eateries and businesses this small hotel meet our expectations our only complaint would be the sound of the air conditioner as it turned on but that is nothing in comparison to the quality of the room compact in size yes but offers everything you need,4.0

small but nice,spent a weekend here the hotel is very small but quaint upon arrival the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the electronic check in is very quick and easy the rooms are a bit small and the showers even smaller that was the only thing i found a little annoying i would definitely stay at this hotel again,5.0
great location but nothing special,"great location as its just minutes from 16th mall but thats about it really rooms are pretty poor equipped no mini bar or mini fridge in rooms thats quiet annoying 
other wise comfy beds nice shower and great tv service staff are pretty nice and helpful",3.0
look no further,our ladies group of 8 get together once a year so it is so important for everything to be perfect from the minute we arrived at the front door we were shown true texas hospitality the valets were friendly and knowledgeable without being pushy this is a valet only hotel due to the parking space constraints of downtown but we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our car even at peak time the valets ran for our cars concierge was friendly and helpful housekeeping did a super job and was quick to respond to our requests the cooktoorder breakfast is included and cant be beatyou name it its available because some of us are early risers we appreciate the layout that has a completely separate living area people in the bedroom cannot hear anything going on in the living area as you know some hotels idea of a separate bedroom is a waisthigh partition great location too,5.0
perfect experience here,"we booked a promotional deal through travelzoo which was very affordable we had a onebedroom suite for three nights in february 
the suite was very spacious especially by nyc standards the bedroom and living room format worked very well for us as we were five people there was plenty of closet space two tvs and two fridges which meant that we never felt as if we were on top of one another 
the rooms and bathrooms were spotless and very attractively decorated the linens were lovely and the beds very comfortable
our room had a view of an air shaft but we didnt care at all as we were not there in the daytime very much
the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful  not a trace of attitude 
if we can get a deal here again we will definitely return a total delight",5.0

awesome place for teensyoung adults,i traveled to san diego for the first time during the summer of 2009 with my church youth group the w hotel is the coolest place for teens and young adults the lobby has a contemporary style and has techno music blasting all day long there is a restaurant there called rice that serves cool stuff i had the pleasure of tasting sexy fries they were really good the pool is small but there is a beach on the rooftop in which you can order anything off the menu as well the hotel is awesome overall i strongly recommend everyone to stay there at least once,5.0

beautiful area beautiful hotel with great staff,the laurel inn is located in a very cute and comfortable neighborhood in san francisco the staff is excellent and the rooms are really big and beautiful the hotel is also in a convenient spot for grabbing the bus line to the trolley and from there going to wherever you need to go if you stay at the laurel inn you wont be disappointed,5.0
clean friendly contemporary great location,great location on 46th street between 5th and 6th avenues so convenient to times square grand central theatre district restaurants in hells kitchen subways and buses and the lincoln tunnel beautiful old building with contemporary youthful rooms great staff  very friendly they let us into our room at 11 rather than 3 and let us store a suitcase the final day after we checked out of our room but before we left nyc decent free continental breakfast  bagels yogurt etc certainly enough to keep you going until lunchtime coffeehot chocolate tea water always available in the lobby highly discounted rate with a parking garage on the next block we paid 52 to park from 11 am until 7 pm the next day we had 2 double beds with 2 parents and 2 teens did not feel crowded in the room youre in nyc  you shouldnt be spending much time in your room highly recommend this hotel and its friendly staff,5.0
hated this place do not stay here,"where to start lets skip over the horrible experience of trying to make changes to our reservation via woogos email and phone help desk and cut right to the chase my boyfriend and i stayed at this place also known as the grant hotel on w94th st twice for 2 nights each time what a disappointment the check in staff were courteous but we straight away noted the fact that this establishment is extremely tight 
1 shared bathrooms usually ok in most places but there was only 1 bathroom to about 8 or 9 rooms and in the case of the firstground floor only 1 shared bathroom total the bathrooms seemed to be cleaned only once per day not enough for a shared facility they were pretty filthy by the afternoon no bath mat there were no hooks or anywhere to place things except on the toilet and in some bathrooms not even a toilet holder or towel rack 
2 the room we had a double on one stay and a double double on the other both times the rooms were very dingy a single fluorescent bulb in the centre of the room and no table lamps the beds themselves were fairly comfortable except the bottom sheet was not fitted and you quickly found yourself sleeping directly on the mattress there was only a thin bedcover and 2 requests for blankets went unmet apparently they were unable to access blankets after hours this meant that the two of us slept in the same bed for warmth thus not using the 2 beds we had paid for the heating also did not work and we were informed there was nothing we could do 
tv limited channel selection but whatever cos there were only a limited number of working remotes in the whole hotel and the first time we stayed we did not get one
the first room the double double was very spacious but pretty much had nothing in it except the beds and remote controlless tv there was a gig empty closet off to one side which was probably intended to be the bathroom but thehy got too tight to put even a sink in which most places with shared bathrooms have 
both rooms were very noisy the walls were paper thin and given that people are coming and going at all hours of the night you could hear doors slamming all the time 
3 in general no tourist information located anywhere in the hotel no pay phones the phones in the room were exorbitantly expensive to use and there was very poor cell phone cpverage the desk staff whilst on the whole quite friendly were absolutely unable to do anything about our complaints we asked to be moved due to the noise but the hotel was full the desk staff were unable to offer us a refund or discount we attempted to complain to woogo but the freecall number could only refer us to the website where we could find nowhere to write a complaint or to a uk international number which we couldnt call there being no payphone in the hotel it was raining for all of these days and very cold so we didnt want to stand on the street at a payphone
on our second stay the toilet flushing mechanism broke on the only toilet on the whole floor and despite telling the desk staff this at about 2pm nothing was done till our second complaint later that night 
dingy cold dirty bathrooms poor sleeping conditions so why did we return for a second stay because our return was going to be within a week of our first stay we found it hard to find anything affordable at such short notice so we were stuck
we would not stay here again we would not recommend this place to anyone for the money if you book with a few weeks notice you can find much nicer places to stay in manhattan try chelsea lodge or hotel 17 not going to bother with photos cos the flash only makes the room look ok",1.0
nice place downtown  great location,we were at the end of a extended weekend stay in colorado and had just come down from climbing mt evans and needed a place to stay in denver we didnt have reservations but we are mariott rewards members so we called them up and they booked us a room at the ritz for a very reasonable price the service was excellent  one of us had twisted an ankle on the mountain and the doorman immediately recognized this and came to our aid to help us with the bags to unload the car and to help us get into the hotel the lobby was beautiful and the room was superb everything was nicely appointed and the bed was luxuriously comfortable we only spent one night there and had to leave early the next morning but we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this ritz property anytime you are in denver,5.0
definitely stay here,"i booked this hotel for an interview at uw out of all of the hotels i had stayed recently this is one of the best especially for the price the staff was more than friendly and helpful for everything i needed take out restaurants at 10 pm shoe stores shuttle information
the room is very comfortable with 2 queen beds the bedding comes with both synthetic pillows and feather pillows for your preference there is a small desk wifi internet
as i had to be at the hospital at 715 am i reserved my shuttle the night before i would definitely recommend this but be aware that you need to make that clear as the driver may not come until 710
the front desk was also very helpful in directing me to the main street near the hotel where there were many shopsrestaurants
there is a afternoon tea but i was not able to partake of it the breakfast is nice with fresh fruit yogurt cereals baked goods hardboiled eggs and make your own waffle station which i might add was pretty good
the nice part about this hotel is that they also have a free washerdryer for the guests you can bring your own laundry detergent or they have packets for sale at the front desk 2 for 1 with dryer sheets included
i would definitely stay here again the only thing is that this hotel is not downtown however there is the hotel shuttle that will take you downtown and bring you back as well as the uw shuttles",5.0
great address historic hotel but just ok,traveling 2 weeks in new england we stayed in july for a couple of days with our teenage sons so they could experience a bit of nyc i used hilton points so i wasnt expecting the greatest rooms no view smaller etc it was clean and visually nice with the styling youd expect but definately starting to show its age id guess that the last serious renovation of bathrooms was in the late 80s the ac wasnt great it got cool enough but we could never seem to get the dampness totally out of the air its central air but i dont think the dials in the room actually control the temp other than the speed of the fan this is our second stay here in 3 years and we were realistic about it so none of that really bothered us we slept fine although the bed was a little soft for my taste my warning is that if you get the basic room here and are expecting a room with the grandeur of the waldorf youre going to be disapointed now the lobby bars resturants and the staff and all the rest is what youd guess they would be,4.0
good location and value for me,"my son and i reserved a room at the hotel pennsylvania for the night of 101304 the hotel is a stately old building that no doubt has a very interesting history the lobby area is very impressive after reading reviews about this hotel prior to our visit i was a bit concerned about the cleanliness when checking in i stated in no uncertain terms that i wanted a refurbished room we were assigned a room on the 10th floor the room was clean not much of a view but the beds were comfortable the bathroom while small was clean and shower worked fine plenty of towels and supplies several lamps in the room and enough plugs to cover laptop cell phone chargers etc joey os restaurant in the hotel is a fine place for a late night dinner serves into the wee hours of the am reported to be until 4am breakfast at the same location was great slightly expensive but good security at the hotel was ever presentneed to show room key prior to getting in elevator 
check in and check out was rather slow but five or six clerks working the desk and a front desk manager was there assisting and taking guests into the pennsylvania 5000 club to register to move the process along
summaryprice i paid was very reasonable and i would not hesitate to stay there next visit to nyc",3.0

the room was spacious by new york standardclean and quiet the breakfast was typical hampton inn fareget there early to get a seat",4.0
perfect start to our vacation,we had stayed at the charlesmark before so when returning to boston we had no hesitation in staying there again our room was perfect and a lot more spacious than the one we had stayed in previously the breakfast was more than substancial along with very nice coffee which started the day well the location of the hotel is definately a selling point a couple of blocks away from boston common and a few away from the prudential centre we were looking for somewhere for our anniversary meal so we booked a table at the atlantic fish co which was a short walk away the food and service was excellant i wish we could get lump crab cakes in england they were fab a highlight of our stay was going to see boston celtics play new york knicks definately a hotel we would recommend,5.0
dont expect too much,i dont expect a ritz carlton experience at doubletree prices but i do expect helpful staff a clean room and everything in working order unfortunately we found a sizable hole in the curtain a non working phone a broken privacy lock and no air conditioning when we checked into our room it took so much trouble to get the air conditioner up and running that we didnt even bother with the rest at over 250 a night after tax i frankly expected a little bit better,3.0
must stay here,"the luxury brand truly speaks for itself at this san francisco location i really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel i am a starwood member and was upgraded to the 17th floor immediately at checkin awesome welcome gift huh
the bar in the lobby is wonderful and a super nice touch with the fireplace partition their bartender was very accommodating and was happy to prepare for me a refreshing nonalcoholic drink nondrinker myself the pool as well as the gym were superb the hotel is located close to market street where everything is the muni also stops in front of this hotel which made it very convenient for my stay",5.0
oh the beds,"this hotel is expensive but we got a great last minute deal and didnt pay full price the location is good for time square about a 10 minute walk i also walked to bryant park in about 15 mins and central park in 30 mins there was nothing much happening in the immediate area unless you count the gay pool party in a hotel we stumbled into the room we had was smallish but really nice and the bed was the most comfy thing i have ever slept on the lobby is beautiful and old school however i wouldnt have been happy to have paid full price which when i enquired was 300 dollars per night for a single room
i would recommend this hotel if you get a good deal",4.0
really nice hotel downtown,"this hotel was in a great locationvery short walk to westlake station for transportation to the airport and throughout the city
the hotel itself is quite nice and very clean and the staff are very pleasant and helpful we asked for a room high up and quiet and received just that wonderful view of city if you are a very light sleeper the traffic could keep you awake part of being downtown
the beds were just okay not the most comfortable for me because i dont like hard beds we were given a corner room on the 24th floor which was very spacious the darkening shades were great
my only gripe would be that for the price you pay for a room you should get free wifi",4.0
ok for an overnight stay but a bit of a dump ,"pros good location for travelling staff seemed very nice for the most part has a guest laundry which was handy buffet breakfast wasnt bad pool was ok plenty of parking close to fast food outlets
cons tired appearance absolutely stank of cigarettes even the nonsmoking areas bit of a rough area located between trailer park and the firework factory very close to highways plastic cutlery noisy aircon",3.0
wonderful place to stay,i did a lot of investigation before i picked the sheraton and it was in my top two based on location price amenities etc but what sealed it for me was when i called the hotel directly to ask a question the women on the line mentioned to me they had a special and asked if i was interested she offered me a price better than i had found anywhere on line including priceline etc she was very helpful this even allowed me to get starwood points once we got to the hotel everyone was very helpful and extremely nice my only recommendations would be that they provide more information on city tours maps locations of sites and transportation information you had to ask the concierge about everything and sometimes they were a little short otherwise though a very enjoyable experience the hotel is in a great part of town and we felt safe the entire time,5.0
small but clean rooms great location,the milner hotel was everything we expected it was in a great location the theater district close to restaurants and near the boston commons and the start of the freedom trail it lies just a few blocks from a subway station which was great the only thing i feel the need to mention is that the rooms are very small they are very clean but there is just enough room for a bed a nightstand and a television this didnt bother us because we didnt spend much time in the room but if you are offended by tiny rooms look elsewhere its in a quiet area so there wasnt much outside noise at night and we slept well overall it was a great stay and a great start to any boston trip especially for newcomers like us,4.0
my last resort,"recently stayed at the ballantyne resort for 3 days on a seminar which was also held at the hotel the hotel is beautiful and clean check in went smoothly had a room on the 7th floor with a balcony and i stress had after the first day of attending the seminar i returned to my room to find that my door would not open when i swiped the room key only to realize that they had moved me to another room without notifying myself or the head of the organised seminar this was the first time i have ever experienced such an incident or have ever heard of something like this happening at a hotel this was an embarrassing situation not only to myself but also to the guest who opened the door and had to hear me insist that this was my room 
i must say that they did remove all my clothes and bags and put them in exactly the same position in the new room even my toothbrush was in the same place very proffesional for a nonproffesional incident my complaints went to management and still no explination for the move but a letter of apology was given along with a free night stay at any starwood hotel
i know that this will be my last resort if ever at back in charlotte",2.0
thrilled by the location,"when staying in dc i always try to find a place near the metro as we dont have a car the marriott is practically on top of the red line however we only used it to arrive tofrom the airport as we found everything we needed within walking distance of the hotel while i selected this hotel since it is near adams morgan easy walk we didnt have to look much further than a block away for several meals 
we were very pleased with the room  great sheets on the bed and the flatscreen was a fun bonus i was concerned about navigating through the hotel as id read about its large size but that was never a problem 
i was very pleased with this hotel for our weekend getaway the location makes a quick trip to the zoo easy  the quick walk makes going only for an hour or so at offpeak times justifiable",5.0
if youre looking for a clean cheap room,if youre looking for a clean cheap room for a night or two i recommend you consider this hotel room size was generous the bed was comfy with fresh crisp linen bathroom was also spotless and the shower water pressure was great free wifi was a plus and the room has a flat screen telly coffee maker small bar fridge and a closet for luggage we drove and parked the car in the hotel parking lot which i noticed was under cctv surviellance we did have to carry our bags up 3 flights of stairs and have seen some other reviews bellyaching about this personally liked this because my wife and i had just finished a 13 hr international flight so it was good to use the muscles and get the blood flowing would recommend a room off the street side if bothered by traffic noise i had ear plugs from my flight so it wasnt a problem also theres a really nice little italian restaurant 100 meters down the street next to a convenience store that sells cheap cold beer and some wines i think its close to many points of interest but cant confirm this as a fact as i only stayed one night and arrived late in the evening i drove to vegas the next day so it was a perfect flop stop for myself and the missus recommended,3.0
aloft couldnt have been better,"my friends and i were visiting philadelphia for a conference and were originally planning to stay at the econolodge at the philadelphia airport after reading reviews for that hotel online we decided to cancel our reservation and i did some more research and found great reviews about aloft not to my surprise i was just as thrilled by aloft as most of the people whose reviews i had read 
aloft was amazing first of all the location was pretty great we didnt want to stay in the heart of philly because it was too expensive but aloft ended up being really convenient they have a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes 247 to the airport so each morning we could catch the shuttle then jump on the train from the airport and that took us directly into the city the shuttle was always efficient and on time the airport pick up location for the shuttle can get crazy but its nothing unnatural for a big city airport the only downside is that the hotel isnt within walking distance to any restaurants but many restaurants deliver directly to your hotel room so its not a bad deal just remember that parking is about 7 bucks a day so that will have to factor into your aloft stay 
the folks at aloft are so nice and very helpful from the minute we arrived they were very attentive and friendly and the interior of the hotel is really great its very hip and spruced up nicely theres a bar area a pool table two computers for guest use and a lounge area they also have a snack bar but the food is pretty expensiveoverpriced but its still good to know its there in case you need it since they dont have room service theres also a great pool very clean and really enjoyable to swim in and an even better fitness room the fitness room featured top of the line equipment and a very nice weight training area they even give you free headphones for your stay 
the room itself was incredible we booked on orbitz so for 90 dollars we got a room with two queen beds a huge lcd flat screen tv free wireless a small fridge and a great bathroom with free amenities it was really pretty unbeatable everything was very clean pristine even the housekeeping staff was very friendly and very efficient the beds were comfortable in fact i slept better there than i do in my own home  and i was on a business trip 
all in all you really cant beat it aloft is really the way to go there are a few other hotels near aloft but i think aloft easily outdoes the others ill definitely be visiting another aloft location soon",5.0
stay away from staybridge at sunset station,"we just returned from a terrible vacation of 5 days at san antonio texas the rooms are very large but the hotel is not very clean rooms elevators bar area we have a theft incident
the good
 the rooms are spacious and well equipped fridge microwave sink coffee maker etc
 the beds and pillows are great
 complementary drinks and snacks see below
 free breakfast but see below
 free parking but see below
the bad
 the room was dirty upon arrival the whole room was dusty the rugs had chips and pieces of candy all over the tub had hairs from previous guests
 we asked for a full room clean up never happened
 the cleaning room service is terrible they make beds and change towels but they do not vacumm the carpets or clean the furniture in a daily basis one day they even leave the room untidy we have to go to the desk for towels and shampoo and made the bed ourselves
 the bathtub was clogged up from day one and was reported 3 different days they fix it the very last day
 the staff is somehow polite but not very helpful they are short in employees the woman at the front desk makes the snacks serves the drinks cleans the floors answers the phones etc
 although the complementary not every night drinks were good dont be fooled by the great snacks they are frozen microwavable junk food from costco
 keep in mind the free breakfast consist in microwave scramble eggs and greasy sausages if you get to the breakfast area 20 minutes prior to the end time you will hardly find a clean dish we take the breakfast one day but prefer to pay for a good breakfast outside
 the free parking is located in a lot 2 blocks away and is full during weekends
 the hotel is away from the river but there is a street car stop very near
 the business center is a small room with 3 slow computers and a printer full at weekends with kids browsing youtube videos i dont blame the hotel for that
the worst
 one night we were having drinks at the barrestaurant area of the hotel and forget to take with us a small bag with a expensive digital camera the bag was returned to the front desk but the camera was robbed there were not security cameras at that spot long story short the camera didnt appear i should have called the police and make a bigger fuss but i save my family from a much more bitter experience i have the formcomplain incident sheet to prove this prime suspects a group of air force personnel that were drinking there and of course an hotel employee that was on duty at the time terrible terrible experience
with all the good reviews and pluses the straybridge hotel at sunset st seems to be a good place for the money but i will avoid at any cost if you like clean rooms efficient staff and safe environment youll be better in a cheaper holiday express or somewhere else",1.0
nice hotel close to nightlife,i stayed for a business convention the omni is not as close to the convention center as some other hotels that said it was a pleasant surprise nice clean rooms ana pleasant staff very close to many restaurants and live music venues on 6th,4.0
we got what we paid for,the serviceat the desk was horrible and slow the design of the hotel is very modern chic but as i went to the public restroom one stall was clogged and the other was dirty then the hallway and the room smelled like paint it was new so the price was lobbing you get what you pay for,1.0
very comfy  good value,spent a night at the doubletree before an early flight warm professional greeting and checkin an odd waitress at dinner but food was really delicious room very comfortable and quiet no face cloth in the room and those weird 1cup coffee makers i prefer the old style so i can heat enough water to use my french presse for espresso in the morning as usual duvet too warm for sleep so had to take the bed apart and remake it very happy to have a regular blanket in the closet i do not understand how anyone can sleep under a down duvet unless youre in the alps with the window open,5.0
nothing good to say about this  stay away,carpets were dirty  took a shower stepped on the carpet went back in the bathroom and left a dirty footprint got locked out of our room and had to get new keys  twice had to check out a hairdryer when i used it i blew a breaker  twice air conditioner was loud and woke us up every time it kicked on our beds were like sleeping on the floor while our friends beds in another room creased everyone to the middle there are 2 pillows on a queen bed each being 12 inches by 12 used condoms in the parking lot breakfast is a plain tasteless pastry cost was relatively inexpensive but still not worth staying in this poor quality of a hotel go somewhere else,1.0

lovely holiday in the desert,we took our 2 year old here for a 5 night stay in early april admittedly we didnt realize it was still spring break and the resort was busy but we still enjoyed our stay its a good location only a 15 minute taxi ride 20 from the airport and you can easily walk to the mountain reserve trails next door and there is a large grocery store just around the corner  we took a cab but you could walk so you can stock up on essentials if you want we also took a taxi to the phoenix zoo which is about 20 minutes away so you dont necessarily need to rent a car the restaurants are a little overpriced but thats to be expected some reviews have complained about the older rooms but i quite liked the character of the older buildings and our room was clean comfortable and spacious its a great place for families with lots to do to keep everyone happy we would go back,4.0
stunningly beautiful,absolutely beautiful hotel with fantastic rooms staff was courteous and pleasant very near to the university of pennsylvania campus,5.0
clean quiet comfortable and conveniently located,we were visiting san diego for one night to catch a preseason chargers game i had searched for hours online for hotels and was finding only outrageous rates then i stumbled across the dolphin motel on tripadvisor even though it was after midnight i was able to telephone the hotel and to book a room our room was fairly small but it was spotless and it included a minifridge and free wifi service the trolley that we took to qualcomm stadium was just a short drive or bus ride away the staff was helpful and the motel is located in an attractive part of san diego this place is a great value,4.0
excellent budget choice in east village,i agree with other reviews here decent and clean place with unbeatable pricequality ratio a double room with taxes only 150 usd per night the room i had was fine for one person but would have been smallish for two however i guess this place is choice mostly for those who only need a place to sleep and look forward to spend their time mostly in the city not in the hotel room so it matters less the location is simply excellent i will definitively be back an extra nice thing is that you do not have to pay them when booking so you can more easily change the travel plans also later on,4.0
highly recommend this hotel,this hotel gets it all right friendly knowledgeable staff lovely property 2 queen room was huge  well laid out good location no small detail has been overlooked,5.0
great staff and good location great beds,"i read an earlier review and was worried about the hard beds but no worry was neededtheyve just changed their beds and they are comfortable
staff is very good friendly and helpful we didnt try the restaurant as it was usually busy always a good sign
its a good 20 min walk to javits center but a inexpensive cab ride
nice area of the city with lots of good resaurants within 45 blocks
overall a good place to stay",4.0
will not stay here again,this motel is in a very bad area lots of people hanging out in cars etc when i walked into the room it had a stale unpleasant odor the room appeared clean for a budget motel but looks can be deceiving the towels were dingy as well as the bedspread there were roaches crawling on the walls the tv kept blinking in and out i was told that the satellite was having problems at this time,1.0
would stay there again,"had a small problem w the window not locking but it was quickly fixed 
small yet clean and no bugs excellent location and price",3.0
save your money and go to great wolf lodge,"the short review poor hotel poor lifegurads poor customer service great wolf lodge in sandusky is a much better value and is run so much better than this place dont waste your money
now for the long review
we visited this hotel at the last minute so i didnt have a chance to read the reviews i wish i had 
the hotel was very run down they built the waterpark on to an existing old hotel our room had 2 nice beds but the bathroom was about to fall apart the grout was coming out everywhere and the knobs in the shower were broken the toilet barely flushed there were only 2 very slow elevators working there was a 3rd one that apparently hasnt worked in a long time scary this made for long wait times to get up to our 5th floor room my husband waited 45 minutes on the day of checkout in order to get our cart of luggage down to the lobby 
the waterpark was pretty cool however the staff in there was terrible they were very rude and the lifeguards were hardly looking at the water i would not trust them to monitor anyone i was surprised that there were no major injuries there did not appear to be any management on duty the staff stood around gawking at teenage girls and making comments to them 
the evening we were there the watepark closed at 900 at 900 there were no towels the guy behind the counter said he was going to to go to housekeeping to get more after waiting several minutes  we left with our 3 kids 8 4 1 to freeze until we could get back to our room guess who we saw pushing a trash can around in the hallway yes it was the towel guy he never planned to come back at all it was just a lie so he wouldnt have to tell us there were no towels some people had been waiting for 20 minutes for a towel then we waited about 10 minutes just to get an elevator up to our floor there were several rude people cutting around the line and pushing into the elevators there were no security guards monitoring the situation 
making the reservation should have been enough to tell me not to go there it took 4 calls to get our room confirmed once because they dont book the stuff themselves so i had to call their reservation line next i had to call the hotel back directly because the reservations people did not know if we could use the waterpark the day of checkout 3rd call was back to reservations after we confirmed we could swim the next dayonly to be told because we were a family of 5 one under the age of 2 we had to book the room directly with the hotel because the manager had to approve it for fire regulations i told the person at the hotel on my first call we were a family of 5 with one under the age of 2 and she never said a word she just gave me the number for reservations my 4th call was back to the very first person i spoke with and she booked the room once i told her what they had said her advice for future visits dont tell the booking people that there will be 5 in the 
room if one is under 2 always just say 4 nice",1.0

good option,i am satisfied with this blind pick for a good fullservice iahconvenient hotel and was able to secure a decent rate architecture is dated 80s and studiostyle rooms windows into the corridor struck me as peculiar as well as having flat screen hdtvs without hdquality picture old lodgenet interface not yet upgraded but hotel lobby is shared with an office building which apparently gives it enough traffic for a full starbucks kiosk which was a nice alternative to the full restaurant option which i did not try but looked good clean staff is friendly but isnt it time for free internet,4.0
incomparable service in philadelphia,"if you want to stay in a hotel that makes you feel pampered and special this is the place of course you have to be prepared to pay premium dollar for the experience but my husband and i think its worth it the food is fabulous although outrageously expensive
we only have two gripesin the wheelchair accessible bathroom the shower grab bars were used as towel bars so we always had to move towels and the bathroom did not have any extra towel barsim hoping hotel management fixes this also our room on the 3rd floor was noisywe could hear all the street noises",4.0
great stay,i spent a few nights recently at the madison for a workrelated trip to dc i had a great stay the staff were very friendly and accommodating the hotel well located and the room was nice i especially loved the free wifi such a rarity in these higher end hotels i stay in for work where you tend to pay more and get less the hotel is right downtown so its easy to walk to most sights and only minutes from 2 metro stations for more distant trips i would definitely stay here again next time im in dc for work,4.0
funky chic or bad porn ,"i never considered myself to be ultraconservative in fact ive been called a metrosexual and have no qualms about wearing pink or purple or red or orange and ive lovingly stayed at ws in other major cities but i have to confess this place looks like a really bad porn in relation to the decor 
to boot the funky chic furniture was very uncomfortable of course this is the w so the place is absolutely impeccable with regard to service and cleanliness but this is not a good hotel for business travel decor can be offensive furniture uncomfortable and of course in the city that never sleeps i should have never stayed in times square  as my seven year old would sayduh ",3.0
great value for the location close to lots,we traveled over spring break the hotel per night average was 129 and we received great service the pool is a little cold and the free breakfast isnt much but we took advantage of the free shuttles to attractions the room was clean it was quiet we had a good view but most of all everyone was helpful polite and generally interested in making sure we had a positive stay i would recommend this property to others interested in having a great time,5.0

pleasantly surprised,after reading the reviews  i will admit that i was very reluctant about staying here however since it was the close to the airport and very affordable we decided to go ahead and stay here everyone was very nice including the reservationist the checkin and checkout clerks and other staff that we encountered our room was bigger than what we expected roomy and clean they provided quick transportation from the car rental place that night and took us back to the airport the next morning although i had access to free dependable internet service  they also have a business center where i was able to print out my boarding pass,4.0
always great,i travel to nyc usually once a year for work and my family accompanies me this is close enough for my business on 6th but close enough to everything else to keep my family entertained we love all of the restaurants on 9th just behind the hotel,5.0
great stay,me and my boyfriend took the kids on a trip to dallas i would give this hotel a thumbs up the hotel was very clean and neat staff was friendly and courteous rooms were clean and roomy very comfortable beds my and my kids stayed in a room together we had a pull out sofa sleeper and two double beds very roomy my boyfriend had a king size bed with a sofa sleeper very roomy the only downside was that there was no microwaves in the room you have to down stairs to the kitchen no big breakfast just a continental breakfast but those are just minor things a block from the galleria mall and surrounding restaurants i would recommend this hotel for leisure or business great price too,4.0
hated it,"i just got back from a small trip to new york over easter weekend this was not my first trip to the city and im a 20 year old student with little money so ive had my share of stays at belowaverage hotels in the past 
when we got there the elevator wasnt working we had to walk up to the luggage room conveniently located on the 7th floor with all our luggage we were told we could use the bathroom right across from it there was no toilet paper
on the bright side they let us check into our room early compared to the dirtstained hallways the room was passable i was able to look past our broken bathroom door and the little bugs in our closet but everything started to add up after a while
after showering we were forced to dry ourselves with towels that somehow made us wetter  and smelled like hot sauce when we came back to the room our beds were not made we did not have any new hot sauce towels and the garbage wasnt changed
general filthyness and little to no maid service aside the hotel is in a great location its really close to central park and its cheap those are the only two factors saving me from giving this dump the lowest review possible if you choose the stay here the only advice i can give you is good luck",2.0
it seems to be slipping,"i have stayed here many times and it has been fine but this stay is slightly more revealing the place seems to be more worn out grimy in spots noisy and not as good in many respects on the honors floor the carpet is filthy the walls are spotty and i find the room musty and sterile the airplane noise is very pronounced and seems worse than on other stays the cafe restaurant has a buffet that has all the basics although by asian standards it is sparse very international guests parking deep under building with all the good spots reserved for the valets
this used to be a very clean and smartlyturned out place but now seems overused and undermaintained i have not tried the honors lounge possibly that is better",2.0
overall a good hotel,"we stayed at the serrano on our second trip to san francisico in 2002  i booked through expedia  it was one of their special name your hotel class and location for 99 and well tell you where the hotel is afterwards this hotel is farther away from union square but still in an ok neighborhood the first room we were in was very small with a double bed and a tiny bathroom it was very updated and clean though 
luckily for us on the second day we were upgraded to a 3 room suite that had a bathroom the size of our first room all this for only 50 total for the rest of the stay that was a great room the staff was very helpful and pleasant i dont think i would stay there again unless i could get the suite for a good price only because there a similarly priced hotels closer to union square",3.0
great day room rate,"the advertised 4995  tax day room rate stay 8am to 8pm and free airport shuttle was the drawcard for me when we had a ten hour layover at lax
as mentioned in other reviews the hotel is dated and in need of a spruce up but for the convenience of somewhere to rest and freshen up and the added value of a pool unheated and free continental breakfast 69am daily  wifi it is perfect
the rooms are standard with decent sized tv and coffee make no fridge breakfast was a crowded affair in a small room with few tables most guests bring a tray from their room and pile it high with bagels toast coffee and watered down juice then carry it back to their rooms or eat outside it is what you come to expect from a free continental breakfast
there is a dennys restaurant next door
this property more than served its purpose as a break between flights and represented value for money",3.0
great location small but adequate room,its in a great location and so many hotels were booked i was happy to find this its an old hotel with lots of charm and small rooms my room looked right across an alley to some office workers but i wasnt there much during the day i read about the ghosts on the hotels website but saw nary a one comfortable bed,4.0
excellent base for visiting dc,"stayed at the palomar for a week in october with my partner jane
we booked this in july having researched trip advisor at which time rated the hotel number one in washington
the location of the hotel is excellent and just a short walk from dupont circle metro station
the dupont circle area has numerous eateries to suit all tastes and budgets
our room was a standard room on the 8th floor and met all our requirements with large bathroomcomfortable bedtelevison etc it was cleanmodern and certainly comfortable
a good nights sleep was no problem
part of our package was a buffet breakfast which was certainly sufficent in itself but the value of same could be used to mix and match from the main breakfast menu
the hotel provided free limitless coffee in the foyer each morning and had a free wine hour in the evneing but we were always too late in returning and missed it
bad news for two people from scotland
all staff could not be more helpful including portersdoor staff and waiting staff and advice given on places to visit and how to get there
my only concern and it is a small one is that the hotel is primarily based at business clientel and can be extremely busy and as tourist it is easy to be engulfed by busy business people
jane and i both enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend same",5.0
youll be happy at the hilton,"i stayed at this hotel during a business trip and i could not have been happier the hotel has a very modern and clean feeling to it rooms remind you of a nice botique hotel in a larger city the room had a very comfortable bed and down pillows it also had a flatscreen tv with plenty of channels 
the bathroom was wonderful it had granitemarble countertopsfloors along with spa toiletries the shower has a beautiful glass door an insider tip though there was no bathtub in my room the shower beautifully tiled is for standing only if you are the kind of traveler who likes to unwind with a bath you will want to ask about this if you call for reservations 
the location of this hotel is terrific you are a minute away from state route 71about fifteen minutes from downtown columbus not in rush hour traffic of course there are several restaurants within five minutes of the hotel if you like steak try texas roadhouse if you like a party atmosphere with wings try quaker steak and lubethis is a cool restaurant with all kinds of neat car memorabilia italian try carrabas there is also a cheesecake factory at the polaris mall to satisfy your sweet tooth
i have stayed at numerous hotels in the columbs area and this was the nicest if this hotel is booked i would recommend the recently rennovated sheraton suites in worthington the hilton at easton is nice but the pricing is much higher

beautiful property,i had not stayed in this hotel for 10 years what a difference and what an improvement beautiful clean rooms,5.0
loved the galleriakimpton boutique hotel,i planned a surprise birthday weekend for my sweetheart and booked the galleria hotel we desired a quiet  small hotel with unscented cleaning products in a convenient area the location of this hotel is perfect and it not only provided a quiet room it did not use any kinds of scents in our room or the lobby but the staff was delightful and incredibly knowledgeable and helpful from restaurant recommends to colouring routes on the map to guide us through different districts and onto a drive along the shore the hotel provides coffee and tea in the morning and a choice of wine from 530700compliments of the manager we paid 10900 per night price included taxes and parking we absolutely loved it,5.0
fairly nice hotel,great price and great view prett nice rooms and clean bathrooms were typical hilton quality the beds were very comfortable with nice comforters the only negative was the cleanliness of the pool area the pool area needs a full time staff to keep organized and clean we walked to the pool area located on the top of the hotel we walked toward the hot tub and noticed that someone had taken a  on the floor next to the hot tub it must have been there all night as me and my girl friend were the first to walk into the pool area that morning overall the pool and hot tub area were nasty other than that i think the hotel is a good spot for base camp,4.0
decent room at a good price,our nonsmoking room was clean although it smelled slightly of smoke the staff was polite the breakfast was decent with waffles two cereal choices and fresh fruit the hotel is located in a convenient location right off of the interstate we had no complaints and we would stay there again,3.0
great stay,i used the stay and park package at the crown and had a very good impression of the property the desk staff were a little aluff but helpful the welcome pack was a surprise and kept our grandson with munchies for the evening we also received a couple of coupons for free appetizers and beer which were very welcome and unexpected they are working on the road in front of the hotel but its easy to maneuver i will use this property again when flying out of phoenix,4.0
very disappointed from checkin to checkout,"we have stayed at embassy suites in other cities and have always been very happy so when planning a trip to visit family in philly we decided to try this embassy suites i have also never written a negative review but felt that our experience warranted it when we arrived the two double beds that i had reserved were not available and we three adults were placed in a king room my daughter slept on the sleep sofa which is probably fine for children but was very uncomfortable for her resulting in complaints of back pain throughout the trip 
the room itself was fairly clean but lots of candy wrappers under the sleep sofa plaster bits around on the rug in both rooms and some kind of splatter on the walls and lampshade of the main sitting room i discovered that the plaster was from series of large patches on the wall of the bedroom that was the view from the bed the lampshade next to the patched wall also had been crushed little things but felt like i was in a slum 
 although we had reserved and paid for three adults the room was set up for two so we had to seek out glasses and towels each day the breakfast hosts on all mornings were short tempered and appeared to be overworked the buffet itself could have been ok but the kitchen obviously had difficulty keeping up with the demand we waited about 45 minutes for just some oatmeal one morning and finally gave up and left to buy breakfast elsewhere there was plenty of bread for toast cold cereal muffins but hard to get healthier options like bagels fresh fruit or hot cereal coffee ran out 33 mornings also on the mornings that we had a little extra time we waited but were still not able to get our simple preferences on the morning that we had to be out by a designated time we settled for dry cereal and toast 
the hotel was very busy and the staff was generally courteous although if we mentioned any of our concerns the response was  we have a large group here today evidently it was so busy that we often waited 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator up and a couple of times chose to walk down rather than wait additionally the air conditionerheat unit was incredibly loud so we had to turn it on for a while shut it off to sleep wake up hot turn it on to cool then off to sleep at check out we were charged for an extra night of parking and after waiting for breakfast found it irritating to have to wait to resolve the overcharge we did stop a the managers reception one night where they served unlimited drinks potato chips and bags of chex mix it was nice although a couple of free drinks and chips certainly does not make up for the inconveniences the only saving grace for us for this facility was that the location is very good",1.0
fantastic location  right on union square,fantastic location right on union square and the cable car route dont stay here if you are expecting facilities  gym etc  but the room was clean and comfortable although the bathroom was very small free internet in the lobby and a tourist booth too very convenient  would certainly stay here again,4.0
one of worst events ever,we stayed at this location before our trip to aspen first they represent that they are at the airport but are in actuality 20 minutes away next in took the shuttle to pick us up at the airport about 1 hr after we received our luggage with other hotel shuttles arriving and departing every 15 minutes when we checked in they tried to give us a smoking room even though the reservation was clearly for nonsmoking the room itself was ok the breakfast in the morning was horrible with even the cold cereal stale would not rec this facility,1.0
great experience  everything you want on a vacation,a brief two night cheer us up train trip to washington a block and a half from union station and the metro  what more could you want oh yes an excellent room very supportive staff and great breakfasts,5.0
charming and affordable alternative in boston,"i have stayed at the ngh many times in the past but had not visited in several years until this october 2012 when i was there for three nights what a change gone are the breakfast room in the basement the hardwood floors in the guest rooms and the aged bathrooms in their places are a restaurant off the lobby that offers a free breakfast daily the quality and variety of the breakfast is the only change for the worst from my last visitsand i am inclined to think that might be the result of the inattentive wait staff watching over the buffet the rooms well my room now have carpeting a modern decor in soothing neutral colors a small but full bathroom and a big flatscreen tv with a gazillion channels 
theres no one to help with luggage the elevator is small and slow but the location is superbyou can pretend to be a bostonianand single travelers can feel very safe
there is limited outdoor parking at an incredibly 20 low price and just down the street is a small gourmetish grocery store that makes fabulous sandwiches for not very much money
this a great base to experience boston closest t stop is exeter streetcopleya couple of blocks but not unmanageable with luggage
guests in wheel chairs or burdened with luggage should enter the ngh from its rear in a public alley no steps and the elevator is close at hand otherwise you will have to negotiate a steep set of stairs if you enter on newbury st",4.0
not for everybody,"i have to weigh in here this place may not be for everyone do you like chain hotels where the rooms are exactly the same all over the country right down to the bedspreads and the picture on the wall do you like being far removed from all the hot spots with maybe some nice freeway noise to sooth you to sleep 
well then maybe you wont care for this place on the other hand we really enjoyed the character of the room its unique decor the neighborhood feel of the breakfasts by the pool 
the kitchenette was very helpful to us traveling with two ravenous teenagers a hotel room with atypical roomy apartmentlike feel
we were so close to what we came to la for for example a nice stroll down hollywood blvd past grumanns chinese theatre who doesnt want to get a free ticket to a tv show or see a superhero or 2 then some great shopping and eating choices on the corner eavesdropping on studio types talking about their deals at the next table then onto the newish la subway for a ride to universal studios no parking hassles for us super staff over the top with great advice and recommendations ohmygod you cannot imagine the view from the restaurant at the top of the hill  get em to give you a ride up there will definitely return here",5.0
cheap stay in downtown boston,"clubquarters is a low budget stay option available in downtown boston close to quincy market faneul hall and also the boston harbor this place is a one of the best options if you dont get to stay in oakwood service apartments
rooms are small though but i would always prefer staying in downtown close to faneiul hall and the quincy market coz these are the most happening places in boston
no bed and breakfast available which is a little discomforting but you have a lot of dunkin donuts and other fast food joints below the hotel you have the elephant castle pub which serves great beer
my stay was pleasant and have had no complaints",3.0
great location  nice rooms,i stayed here 3 nights 4 days for a conference nearby all staff members were very friendly and helpful when asked questions the rooms were great  comfortable bedding separate tubshower my room didnt have much of a view and my window did not open which bummed me out  but i would absolutely recommend this property and stay there again myself,4.0
cool decor in a hip neighbourhood,"we had a really nice stay here the location is great for the du point circle neighbourhood which is great for restaurants and bookstores etc its still within walking of the white house etc
the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly the rooms are spacious and clean although it is a refurbished older building so there are some imperfections in the corridors and common areas but all in all it is very nice
complimentary wine every evening around 6 pm is a plus",4.0
great location,stayed here five nights and you should be warned that great prices for the hotel are because it is completely surrounded by construction however very quiet indoors and the staff goes out of their way to make your stay great,5.0
the food service and decor of the french room are second to none,the adolphus is a nice hotel with an incredible staff dining in the french room is a delightful experience for each of your senses that is certain to unsurpassed by any restaurant in the world,5.0
clean comfortable rooms,the rooms are clean and small but beds are quite comfortable close to airport and has a heated pool and hot tub the pool area is very warm and comfortable kids had a great time would stay again cheaper if you book online,4.0
youll love it here,"my husband and i stayed here for part of our vacation being casual people we still felt very welcome and comfortable the room we stayed in was large and clean lots of desk area should you be on business the room had 2 phones 
 the replenished starbucks coffee the all natural toiletries recycling bins as well as the working windows were an added plus 
the grounds are well maintained and comfortable being just a few minutes drive from the airport seemed a little daunting to me at first since i am a country girl but the hotel sits on acres of wetlands and that really buffered out the city noises we felt very secure 
 the staff were all so friendly 
 the continental breakfast is addictive we ate it 4 out of five days its not your run of the mill type either oats with nuts and fruits all sorts of breads fresh fruit salmon yogurts coffees teas juices youll love it
 there is a commons room where you can grab a book off of the shelf or bring your own and lounge around to read there is a television in the room too the snacks in the room are available 247 when we were there they consisted of choc covered raisins white choc covered pretzels malted milk balls mint and choc chpis string cheese yogurt ice cream bottled water awesome
 we were so impressed with the hotel we were there for pleasure but i can see why business meetings happen there i highly recommend this place if we travel again to the seattle area we will most definitely stay at cedarbrook",5.0
best deal in town,"great location large room comfortable kingsized bed excellent price im really glad that i shopped around before selecting a hotel after looking up hotels all over town both on trip advisor and by actually going to each hotels website the donatello won handsdown over all others i couldnt be happier my selection the location is convenient to union square the room was spacious had a very comfortable kingsized bed a sleep sofa a kitchenette with a coffee maker and a microwave as well as some dishes cups glasses and silverware  and they dont charge extra for these amenities like many of the hotels in town do  they are included at the price
the staff was very friendly my husband had an injury which required surgery to a tendon in his anklefoot prior to our vacation so we had a scooter delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival the hotel staff held onto the scooter until we arrived and then delivered it to our room upon our arrival they put us in a handicapped accessible room which was probably a little larger than a regular room we were very happy with the room that they put us in
upon reading many of the reviews on trip advisor i saw many people complained about noise from the street and noise from the elevators we were in a room right next to the elevators and didnt have any issue whatsoever with noise from the elevator in addition our room was on the 6th floor and faced post street we didnt have any problem at all with noise from the street the first night we heard sirens from an ambulance or firetruck but other than that no problems whatsoever the windows are tightly sealed which helps to keep the sound from the street down 
the hotel is currently being renovated  new carpeting installed some painting etc so it will be even nicer for those who stay there in the future the staff was very friendly we were greeted by jesus upon our arrival  he was very friendly and had a great sense of humor kara was also very helpful in telling us about places to go and things to see around town there were several other people who worked the front desk and several concierge team members all of whom were friendly and accommodating even the cleaning people were friendly 
i will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family who plan to go to san francisco it really is the best deal in town o",5.0
top notch in making you feel welcomed very impressive,we were not registered guests at this location but have stayed at hamptons in other states we dropped in to use the restrooms and were warmly greeted each time and noticed how outstanding the staff was in meeting guests needs and making them feel at home there was always lemon water available to quench the thirst and the warm cookie we tried was better than homewoods we asked questions and were astounded that their parking was free as all other hotels even ones 3 blocks more away from town center really soaked the patronage for parking fees we observed patrol in the parking area and at night it was well lit so we felt relatively safe as that whole area is plucked with delapidation and new construction intermixed i just wanted to say that based on the courtesy and kindness of this property we would definitely make it a base point for exploring the attractions within walking distance should we return to san antonio,4.0
very solid choicegood balance between business and hip,"as a business traveler who probably spends 30 nightsyear in a hotel conservatively im usually have a pretty good set of options in chicago ive stayed at the w city center downtown in the loop the trump and the hard rock most recently i decided to take a trip to the gold coast area and stay at the sofiftel
ive stayed at the sofitel in washington dc and have been impressed by the chains balance between being hip and being a functional business hotel the chicago water tower location succeeded on both fronts
the lobby is dark and the decor is pretty hip without being too minimalistic or trying too hard its going to be hip for a guy whos used to staying at the westin or hilton but for a guy whos used to the w its gonna be more businesslike
checkin was efficient and the frontdesk staff address you by name and ask if you have stayed with them before
rooms are fairly spacious with a very comfortable bed and decent toiletries from l occitane desk space is pretty good and there is good closet space for longer stays rooms are quiet and you have a good amount of privacy and quiet even though youre in a fairly busyhip area
the bathroom has a separate tub and shower so you can take your shower while your girl soaks in a tub
room service was decent i had some kind of club sandwich with some tasty fries there is a minibar in the room which is reasonably stocked i think there is ice service on all floors as well
when checking out i realized i had one bag too many and might get stopped if trying to do everything as carryon so while checking out at 430 am i asked the concierge to ship my computer bag back to me no problem they said and they directed housekeeping to pull the bag and emailed me the tracking number soon after a very nice touch
i would definitely come back here my next stay however is at the dana hotel  spa",4.0
good rate and location poor rooms,"the location and the reception care are very good old hotel will need a restauration we reserved a suite 3 persons the rooms we got were really small the single ok but the double was in a space for a single one even the bathroom was really sacrified
but how we pay canceled these problems the rate is very good to stay in manhattan",3.0
smeely room and bedding that was musty and old,the smell in the room was overpowering each pillow too smelt like it hadnt been changed in years the carpet was extremely old and i could not wait to get out there were no bath towels so i had to ring for them having requested towels and air fresher the staff delivered and were delightful about it but i will never stay there again,2.0
upscale washington,stayed here 57 may 2006 very elegant hotel staff not overly friendly or helpful except bell boy good size room with bath in bathroom very comfy bed really loud air conditioning in the room which we didnt mind white noise but some might find annoying close to several subway locations which was handy washington dc is the most gorgeous city we loved it 2 days was not enough monuments at night tour is highly recommended also leave some time to explore arlington cemetery  although a sad place it is beautiful peaceful and full of amazing history try to fly in and out of ronald reagan national airport it is on the subway line and much close and easier than dulles,4.0
i love this hotel,its surprising how some people could display total and absolute professionalism in their chosen career i have traveled a lot across the united states and rarely meet perfect hotel attendants and associates whose services meet not only my expectation but a model worthy of emulation i met jacqueline of chicago south loop hotel on thursday morning and her courteous interraction decent language and professional approach to duty since is so inspiring that chicago south loop hotel will forever remain my chosen home away from home jacqueline is a wonderful and phenominal associate of this hotel it is my fervent hope and wish that her stewardship will go a long way into full recognition not only by the management and staff of this hotel but from all and sundry that comes close to her while congratulating jacqueline for her exceptional services would urge her to remain blessed in the lord ,4.0
great location,"we had an adorable little room in the courtyard and loved our stay here were here for 3 nights within walking distance to great cafes restaurants and bars as well as the palace of fine arts  beautiful there are bus stops within a block or so that can take you about anywhere youd want to go in the city we bought bus passes at the walgreens just down the street and were good to go  very convenient 
on a chilly day turning the corner to enter the courtyard is like walking into summer time the flowers are beautiful and everything is well maintained make sure to try the cedar hill kitchen and smokehouse just a block away  great bbq",5.0

one of the best,many older hotels are remodelling and upgrading their guest rooms but not many are investing extra time and effort to give their rooms some style and personality the designers at the tomo in japan center went out of their way to create rooms that are comfortable and relaxing but also fun to be in with big handpainted murals on the walls and artwork suggesting various japanese pop culture images godzilla hello kitty and various anime characters upon arrival i was greeted in the lobby by television monitors showing japanese cartoons and old godzilla movies and i was immediately handed a free sample of cold flavored sake definitely the nicest greeting ive ever experienced the desk clerk honored my request for a room at the back the room on the 7th floor contained a kingsize bed flatscreen tv which only got a few channels and even those were fuzzy and all the stuff you expect these days in a midrange hotel the decor was basically modern japan with some unusual touches like the mural depicting a monster not godzilla attacking tokyo and a large photograph of a womans eye even with the artwork the room was extremely comfortable and i knew right away i would enjoy a good nights sleep the location was so quiet i could have easily kept the window open all night weather permitting for a little over 100 this was an incredible bargain for a room of this quality in san francisco i parked overnight at the nearby japan center for 15 still a great deal this neighborhood is packed with great restaurants between japan center and the restaurants along fillmore youve easily got a weeks worth of great dining all within a five minute walk i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting sf business travellers families honeymooners anybody the unique decor and the low rates should appeal to anyone,5.0
prime location and a nice hotel,"if you are looking to be in the times square  theater district area of manhattan this hotel is a great choice as it is located at 43rd street  8th avenue used spg points so great deal
the hotel as most westins is very nice the second floor lobby is big with a bar and restaurant near the 8th avenue side and comfortable seating near the reception area the service was wonderful throughout the hotel 
the rooms are a decent size for a big city the beds were comfortable and the room was clean a few hiccups the water in the shower was hard to regulate the safe kept getting stuck and the tv remote was hard to work but all fairly minor 
we did not eat in the hotel brought the kids to the hard rock cafe one block away  we ate at shun lee west upscale very good chinese by lincoln center and we all ate at tramonti overpriced italian but on restaurant row had coffee at toms restaurant used for seinfeld show up around 112th street  broadway fun 
drinks at the westin bar were expensive but what you would expect so we passed for a few dollars more 9 for a beer 19 for a martini we had drinks at the mandarin oriental lobby lounge in columbus circle it is on the 35th floor  great views of central park and nyc i can actually say it was worth the price less expensive drinks were had at smiths just a few blocks away
added benefit  the tampa rays were staying here and ran into evan longoria  johnny damon overall an excellent option for midtown manhattan with the family",4.0
very well appointed room pleasant staff continental breakfast,"we moved from another hotel and were very pleased
 room is spacious and just as it appears in the photos
 very clean
 bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows
 the large couch was great with plenty of room and the ottoman is a great place for a food tray or a work area
 refrigerator but wish it also had a microwave front desk staff graciously heated some food that i brought
 good continental breakfast and a tray is provided in your room so you can bring it back if you go too late selection is more limited
 42 inch lcd screen easily swivels for easy viewing from the sofa or bed
 work desk wifi and adjacent connections you can connect to your 42 screen
 we loved the glass shower and our shower head worked great
 there are 2 computers for your use off of the lobby
 free parking
 its not really adjacent to the iah airport but it does have a shuttle it is a block from greenspoint mall which we preferred and on beltway 8 between i45 and hardy toll road our year old garmin gave directions to the previous hyatt iah location when we searched by name but since were previously lived in houston we knew that was wrong the address can be a little tricky even though the hotel is very visible from beltway 8  so get good directions andor a good map
 room rates are normally less on weekends actually got the best rate from the hyatt web 89 thur and 80 fri rates were much higher for wed which is why we originally started out at another hotel but we got what we paid for at brand x
i think i checked out every booking web site and hotel web for houston other than lucking out with priceline or hotwire i know i got a great deal",5.0
hip and happening,love the way it is decorated great art pieces brilliant door pictures quirky little things like not a standard bible but a spiritual menu standard rooms are on the small side deluxe are a nice size restaurant next door is also great travis the fo manager has done everything to make us leave happy and happy we were,4.0
first stay at the jw marriott was outstanding,"we recently stayed over the thanksgiving weekend at jw and found the staff thoroughly delightful from the telephone agents to the front desk all were welcoming and helpful they allowed us to upgrade to club access with our gold status and had free wifi had an interior room on the 11th floor that was smallish but well maintained and a friendly helpful maid
had a very nice rate too as it was a slow time of the year for the hotel looking forward to our next stay",5.0
terrific hotel great location,this is a great hotel with a lot of character close to union square so youre near everything the staff is really friendly and attentive to your needs we hosted a surprise film screening in one of the meeting rooms for my uncle who turned 60 and it was a very successful event loved the wine tasting hour,5.0
livingsocial deal is a scam second class citizens,at the courtyard by marriott there are customers and there are the dregs  which means anyone with a living social coupon first there are dozens of blackout dates which at least theyre honest about and show you up front but then there are severe restrictions on how many of the coupons they will accept each week so you have to book minimum four weeks in advance this they dont tell you until after you purchase the coupon i spoke with the sales director who told me there are plenty of rooms available on various dates for regular customers but not for the lowlife living social people its the back of the bus for us,1.0
great hotel  close to downtown,"my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel while on vacation in some reviews it was said that the hotel was difficult to find the only difficulty getting to the hotel would be the oneway streets but its easy to find
we arrived before checkin and our room was already ready it was clean open and spacious we had a studio suite  which included a queen bed couch chair coffee table desk and chair and a full kitchenette  with plates glasses potspans dishwasher disposal etc the breakfast was continental we bought in groceries and cooked the first morning i missed the breakfast but the staff brought out bagels danish etc for me to bring up to the room 
the maid staff gave us extra towels and supplies because we were still in the room and came back to clean after we left the room this followed for the remainder of our stay the maid staff even finished the dishes in the sink and ran the dishwasher the maid staff was great
we had friends visit and the hotel staff called our room before letting them up to the room it was nice to know that the general public could not just roam the halls also there was enough room to have a few people hang out in the room without being crowded it was a relaxing atmosphere
the hotel is next to a medical center with a helicopter pad the noise from the emergency vechiles was not distracting 
the hotel is about a 6 cab ride from the 16th street mall which is awesome you can walk to the 16th street mall in about 15 minutes the hotel is also realitively near the us denver mint state capital pepsi center etc 
there is free wifi in the main lobby which has limited counter space in the hotel room there is internet via wire
this hotel isnt the romantic getaway type of place but it is a great clean hotel that didnt cost an arm  leg 
we are planning to go back next year and i will stay here again",5.0
great place to stay to explore seattle,we had excellent service and a comfortableclean room at the renaissance seattle hotel we were on the eastern side of the hotel but we were on a higher floor so there was no problem with noise the hotel had a room available for us to check in early which was wonderful the location is a convenient walk to many attractions in seattle,5.0
great location  great for your budget,"the lobby is very european in feel the rooms are small and the decor is a bit bare however the rooms are bigger than the much more expensive hudson hotel you have a brand new sink in your room there are several very new very clean bathrooms per floor that you share with the other guests never once did we have a problem getting into the bathroom they clean the bathrooms every few hours the doors on the bathrooms are a bit noisy so the first night i woke up every time someone went to the bathroom however that was the only noise we encountered and i got used to it quick  maybe ask for a room on one of the ends we were right across from one of the bathrooms otherwise it was quiet and clean 
you cant beat the location you are a few blocks from union square and very close to the trains you can get anywhere in manhatten quick there are also some great restaurants nearby we had great sushi in the basement of washington irvings house right down the street",4.0
hotel for a conference,i visited philadelphia for a scientific meeting the hotel is well equipped for receiving large crowds of professionals the facilties are great i would review the air conditioning some of us complained bitterly on how cold it was in the meeting rooms sometimes to a point of being difficult to remain in the conference being listened to in addition it look unsual that in thia stage and age there are no safe boxes in the rooms and valuables have to be kept at the reception the help received from the concierge was great always pleasant and helpful particularly nice was mary mastrobuoni i hope the hotel notices her she is good with people,4.0
great stay friendly service,"i stayed here with my wife and had booked one of the smaller rooms when we went to the room i was definitely disappointed it was very small and had a partition i called downstairs and stated that i wasnt that happy about the room the hotel was pretty booked up but the staff showed me an available suite he was kind enough to offer me the room for a reasonable upgrade fee which i really appreciated the suite was really amazing and spacious and had nice views the decor was very nice as well
the hotel is in a great location close to many restaurants and horton plaza
we had breakfast our last morning here my wife ordered a plate and when it was presented it was not what she had picturedthey happily took it back and let her order something else the staff at this hotel was great and accommodating which was much appreciated i have booked a room here for another stay in june of this year",5.0
what a gem,"weve stayed in ritz carltons and similarly rated hotels over the years and were really impressed with the level of service spaciousness cleanliness and decor at the palomar the complimentary wine happy hour was lovely as well as the coffee service offered in the morning this will be our go to hotel the next time we travel to philadelphia location is great right in the heart of downtown philly the staff was particularly attentive the restaurant square 1682 is fantastic and the room was well appointed bed linens are particularly nice
i would highly recommend this hotel to anyoneand the fact that it is pet friendly is unusual and makes it all the more distinctive it really felt more like we were somewhere in europe",5.0
decent choice near the airport,"i have stayed at this property many times and find it is a decent choice in the phl airport area the rate varies based upon demand but most times you can get a good deal using the marriott website and aaa the property has ample parking but if it is very busy you may find yourself in a space that is a bit of a hike from the hotel due to its location and layout the parking lot is safer compared to other phl airport hotels in my experience use common sense and never leave anything valuable in plain sight when parking you car at airport area hotels
the property has a fitness center and an indoor pool the rooms are typical for a renaissance and the ones on the upper floors are the best room service is usually prompt and they have a decent menu of choices the bar usually has some sports programming on the many screens and even has a pool table to keep you entertained lee behind the bar is an attentive bartender and reportedly is a decent soccer player as well",4.0
copley courtyard in the middle of everything,great stay rooms are a little tight with the feel of a smaller boutique style hotel near fenway 10 blocks shopping on newbury street the t and quite walkable to the historic sites downtown bernardo the gm goes out of his way to make his guests feel at home whatever he can do to make your stay easier will be at the top of his list,5.0
never in my life been treated so poorly by the front office staff,had reservations for my best friends wedding the front desk staff was very rude and when i called him out on it he threatened me telling me to leave and he was calling the police,1.0
cheap and cheerful stay great staff,went to nyc with 7 other girls to celebrate our birthdays arrived on the 13th april and was staying for 5 days loved the hotel our rooms were massive enough room for 3 1820 year old girls to spread all our clothes and shopping everywhere the rooms were really clean and nicely decorated the hotel is in a brilliant location close to times square rockerfeller centre and broadway and near to enough subway stations to tour the rest of the city the staff were more than helpful always giving us tips and advice we were over there when the iceland volcano errupted so we ended up stranded for 8 days longer than planned and the hotel staff were amazing we couldnt have asked for more would reccomend this hotel to anybody and will be visiting new york again in the near future,4.0
fantastic hotel,"checkin was great stephen made sure we were aware of all the facilities and had our bags delivered within minutes we were apparently upgraded and the room was very spacious and chic 
close to the moma as well as plenty of upscale and downmarket shopping 
by the bed is an lcd touchscreen unit that controls the ac lighting curtains phone and radio the king bed was very comfortable despite being on the 19th floor some street noise intruded good sized flat screen tv in the bedroom and a smaller one in the bathroom large deep tub and large separate shower stall with waterfall shower head nice big fluffy towels and dressing gown slippers too
the fitness center is well equiped and the pool is great for laps
internet was fast although i am always annoyed at the extra charge for it in higher end hotels 1495 here
housekeeping was very efficient nightly turndown included evian water
free coffee or tea in the morning in the 4th floor restaurant
oh yes i would stay there again",5.0
good location,the hotel is is on w 40th half a block to times square or bryant park either way just a few blocks to shopping  the theaters the hotel was clean staff was friendly  very helpful our room was on the 21st floor quiet comfortable king bed the concierge suggested jacks bar  restaurant just down the street as we didnt have reservations for that night good foodstaff,4.0
great location  good base for short stay,chicago wasnt cheap and this one cost us more than some others but it was fine it is in a great location and was very clean the laundry free was a bonus for us as we needed to wash by this time the club room was a good spot for using their internet and hanging out we would stay there again,4.0
very bad black mold,"noticed odor when we checked in turned on ac and did not think about it again until time for a shower when we noticed mold stood on bathtub rim and took pictures of hairy growth black mold which we have had a horrible experience in the past brought this to the attention of the manager at check out explained i would be contacting health dept when manager did refund our stay and accuse me of threatening him and his hotel i stated that this could be the serious type of mold and needed to be checked because we had complained earlier to staff and were shown another room that had same problems
manager become irate and even hostile so we left and will not returntoo bad cause we liked the place we just wanted the health problem corrected and checked by code enforcement",1.0
great atmosphere,if you are looking for something at little out of the ordinary stay at the hotel zaza everything about the place is unique the quality of the service and back drops are not great but if you can overlook the details it is worth the stay we really loved the movies playing on the outside of the building when you arrive and depart in the evenings,5.0
very convenient and new  just wish it cost a little less,the room was spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable i have slept in for a while the comforter helped me get to sleep its very quiet even though its next to the new football stadium the price was reasonable compared to others i checked but it could have been a little less imo the internet connection worked well  they have wired and wireless the place was basically spotless breakfast was disappointing but it usually is at these type of places where its included this is very convenient to downtown i was surprised that the staff would only extend my checkout from 11 am to noon  they could have given me more time especially since i am a priority club member overall would recommend i was also surprised that i had to pay 10 for parking in an open air lot behind the hotel,4.0
the most expensive worst nights sleep i ever had,"we stayed here to end our recent holiday to nyc and cruise to bermuda before the cruise we stayed in a small hotel called the blakely on west 55th and it comparison to the waldorf it was fantastic
the waldorf was supposed to be the perfect end to a perfect holiday  it couldnt have been further we booked the room 6 months ago and when we got there we asked for an upgrade if they had any available which they did when we arrived in our room we were a little concerned as to what our nonupgraded room may have looked like this was one of the smallest rooms i have ever stayed in and our view was of the aircon units servicing the building
as they had no other rooms to offer we decided to make the most of it and went out for dinner when we went to bed i woke an hour later to the aircon generators stopping and starting on rotation like they were in he room which us then on top of that our room was close to elevators which ping twice when someone gets of on your floor  i swear every person in nyc was staying on our floor  that lift pinged twice on and off consistently between 130 and 330 when we finally went back to sleep we were woken at 6am by a constant creaking sould when we went to investigate we saw that our room was directly opposite the service lifts which are shielded by a swinging door that has never in its life been introduced to wd40 this then continued for the rest of the morning until we gave up trying to sleep and got up
we complained but as we had booked thru an agent they could refund the room rate which i will now never do again as you have no come back so we are trying to get a free stay in another hilton group hotel closer to home but as the previous poster said it would surprise me if we ever heard back 
if you are looking for somewhere special to stay do not stay in the waldorf astoria  it is completely rubbish and the most expensive worst nights sleep i have ever had",1.0
great location,stayed here on a leisure trip to ny its central location ensures that most sites are within walking distance our room was large and quiet the bath did not drain properly on the first morning but this problem was rectified immediately by housekeeping even though we hadnt highlighted it didnt eat breakfast there as its 40 a head and i personally couldnt justify that given the options available in some many nearby cafes the decor may not to be everyones taste but we had a large tv a very spacious room and didnt require cabs public transport its very hard to find fault with this hotel,4.0
disappointed by the holiday inn express sea world,"my husband and i recently spent 5 nights at the holiday inn express sea world based on the excellent reviews on trip advisor in my opinion the hotel does not deserve an above average rating the rooms were decorated on the lower scale of the budget hotel rooms i have stayed in the decor was sparse the beds were very hard the pillows were flat and the linens seemed worn out
on the first night of our stay the sink started leaking we called maintenance and they unsuccessfully tried to fix it we asked for a room change but the staff said one was not available because the hotel was full the sink leaked for the remainder of our stay the housekeeper managed to put a trash can under the sink to collect the water but that was the extent of the maintenance 
the hotels front desk staff is cheerful but no help in recommending area restaurants when asked about authentic mexican restaurants we were referred to the local chipotles a franchise restaurant 
the two positive aspects of the hotel are the location and the breakfast it is close to all of the attractions and the main highway the breakfast was pretty filling and a good way to start a day of touring attractions i would not stay at this hotel again and in the future will be more cautious when booking a room solely based on trip advisor ratings",2.0
dont stay here when a convention is in town which is all the time,i stayed at this property during the american academy of orthopedic surgeons i made the reservation well in advance when i arrived they stuck me in a conference room with a murphy bed because they were overbooked a tv had been rolled in on a stand and a little circular table placed in the middle of the floor to serve as a desk their compensation for this inconvenience was half off the nightly rate they should have given me the room for free i spoke with the manager who did not even apologize and would offer nothing more not even a free meal or a discount the next time i stayed there it was a horrible experience i pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms still nothing it was like he wanted to say  you without actually saying it,1.0
have always enjoy it,my parterner and i are both pursers for major international airlines we stay in a majority or hotels world wide when given the opportunity we consistantly stay at the amsterdam court it is personable staff is very nice and the location is great weve never had a bad experience her in all the times 6 so far we stayed here we had to stay at the ny hilton once and missed the comfort of the ams court its the best value in town i would always choose staying here as would my partner,5.0
a yearly event,we have been down to phoenix for the last 3 years in a row to celebrate mothers day and we keep coming back to this resort the rooms are gorgeous the food is great and the service is top notch our only complaint is the location but you have to drive to get around phoenix in any event so its not a big deal our favourite family tradition there are 7 adults and 4 kids is sitting by the falls and having snacks and drinks and catching up the pool staff at the falls are always great and this year ryan had us in stiches and was really great about making my dad and my brother the weird canadian drinks they kept requesting the mothers day brunch is amazing and we always enjoy stuffing ourselves silly and then heading back to the poolside to nap and digest a really fantastic place for families and we cant wait to come back again next year,4.0
treated like royalty at the royalton,"the royalton hotel was everything and more that my husband and i wanted from a nyc hotel typically nyc hotel rooms are tiny but our standard room was spacious and had an incredible bathroom with tons of space mosaic glass tiles a giant round tub and a trendy makeup station the bed was very comfortable and had very nice linens there was even plenty of closet space location could not be better  a two block walk from time square and a ten minute or less cab ride to most places in manhatten the lobby bar is gorgeous dimly lit and very eye pleasing
this hotel definitely caters to an upscale 20s30s crowd but i think that anyone would be happy with their stay we booked the hotel on travelocity and were able to stay for 109night an absolute steal
i would recommend this hotel to anyone we had a perfect 5 night stay",5.0
watch your credit card bill carefully,look this isnt a review about their ammenities as far as bed and facilities go this is a decent hotel but the jerks who run the billing and accounting for this hotel should be fired i booked the hotel for a stay in april  it was a regular booking no special discounts or conditions  they charged my credit card immediately and in full more than a month before i had the reservation scheduled i had to cancelweeks before the arrival date and in full compliance with their cancellation policy  i have still not receieved my refund to my credit card and dealing with their accounting department amounts to leaving a message on their voicemail and never receiving a call back  these people are total incompetents and im now pursuing a refund providing all the relevant documentation through my credit card company because these idiots at radisson are incapable of providing the assistance and customer support any other hotel could  their accounting department at this hotel is staffed by a bunch of incompetent screw ups  be very careful booking at this hotel and watch your credit card statement very very carefully these people are not to be trusted,1.0
could be better,the price was right so i was excited to find a great place to stay every time i come to nyc really not happy the idea behind the place is excellent cater to biz folks got in with a tiny but good room plenty of storage space no ac ask for it to be fixed by next morning discover coffee pot also did not work attendant stood there while i had just woken up stating he had to make sure it was broken then finally left and brought a new one next told they could not move my room despite ac then said it was fixed when it wasnt and finally got another desk attendant who moved my room suppose to have access to irons in hall closet but there never were any though to be fair when you call they bring one came back one night and some poor guy had a reservation and no room at all gym is so small you literally have not space to do a sit up lastly they did not replace simple things every day like coffee and creamer in the room ideas that are good include a grab and go breakfast for 5 bucks and the free water refills plus a free night stay upon return but honestly not sure it is worth it nice staff just ineffective,3.0
great location great stay,"my husband and i stayed at the lucerne hotel for the week before the 4th of july we booked a deluxe king room but were given a complimentary deluxe king suite room unfortunately it didnt even occur to me to ask why but the suite was wonderful both the bedroom and living room had flat screen tvs and each room and the bathroom had windows overlooking amsterdam ave the room was very comfortable and quit and had outstanding ac which was more than welcome during one of the hotter weeks in ny at checkin the staff was very friendly we did arrive before checkin time and the room was not ready but we were able to check our bags and begin our vacation 
the hotels location cant be beat the museum of natural history and central park are a few blocks away to the east and riverside park is a few blocks to the west you have easy access to the 1 b and c trains and my new best friend the m79 bus 
overall i loved this hotel and would stay here again however if you are looking for a modern hipster locale you really should keep looking the lucerne is more traditional in decor and temperament",5.0
would definately go back there,"i actually stayed in this hotel from 5th  9th december 2002 while the hotel was undergoing some refurbishment it didnt ruin the trip at all
i thought this hotel was comfortable convenient and unique 
the staff were always very helpful even suggesting good places to eat as there was no restaurant in the hotel
my one gripe would be that the blankets over the beds were very static and i kept giving myself electric shocks
if you go anywhere for lunch or dinner in ny and you stay here i highly recommend the sports bar opposite madison square gardens its only a 5 minute walk away we went there just before seeing a ny rangers hockey match another must and they serve the most divine cheeseburgers in the world id go back for them alone",4.0
perfect locationout of the hustle  bustle of la,my husband and i stayed here between 1317 october and we were so happy we did the location was fantastic our room was 5 star it was so big and plush with stunning views and walking distance to city walk and universal studios every night we would walk to city walk and have dinner in one of their restaurants and then walk back to the hotel the hop on hop off bus even comes to the door of the hotel i think every 30 mins and drops you right outside the chinese theatre and the metro is just a short walk down the road and one stop to the walk of fame this was our first time to la and we loved every minute of it we would definitely be recommending the hilton to friends and family,5.0
spacious great view of times square excellent midtown location,"this is probably my 6th or 7th visit to this very large marriott hotel while it is not my favorite place to stay in new york because it is so huge i prefer the marriott eastside on lexington avenue which has more intimate old workd charm it has all the services and amenities of a good midtown hotel
i particularly like the fact that every time i have stayed here i have had a nice large room and a different view
the fitness center is a good size and i have never had to wait to use the treadmill or elyptical trainer
the concierge lounge is also large and never too crowded",4.0
satisfactory stay,"just returned from 4 night stay at the westin i was able to secure a rate of 77 on priceline i would have preferred to stay in a trendier location but those hotels were often full and we wanted some flexibility to use public transportation as well as our car 
the room was clean and comfortable and the dream beds are hard to beat but the front desk was perpetually understaffed creating long tedious lines additionally we felt that we wasted too much time waiting in line and then being ill advised by the concierge btw we were forced to seek out the concierge because the business center was invariably closed for a site as large and businesscentric as the westin the limited hours of the business center are unacceptable it wasnt open at all on sunday and closed early on saturday i would have much preferred to mapquest my few routes on my own instead of waiting in another long line for the concierge what irked me most about the concierge service was their combined inability to get me the correct details on taking a public bus to dodger stadium pick up the 2 or 4 bus from broadway to the stadium and walk up the hill while i realize that most employees and tourists drive to each point of interest i was traveling from boston and nyc and sought easy public transportation and walking routes to some sites at the very least for travelers such as myself the hotel should make available simple directions to local sites via walking or busmetro we ended up walking home the 15 miles from dodger stadium while it wasnt the prettiest walk it was easy and safe
for those going to an angels game we took the metro orange line to the anaheim stop and the amtrak home it was quick and direct the anaheim stop lets you off in the angels parking lot
we did have a very lovely waiter for brunch at the westin i believe his name was edgar the valets and porters were each eager to help and efficient",2.0
modern and brilliant  wonderful interiors,park hyatt was brilliant it truly is in an elite class of hotels it stands out as soon as you walk thru the front doors  with its minmalistic design front desk etc the room itself like the rest of the hotel is new and fresh with ample of room the bathroom in dark tiles looks straight from a magazine the restaurant downstairs is also fantastic serving great breakfast and dinner  obama came here to celebrate his wedding anniversary too restaurant that is 2 slight negatives  the gympool great facilities but so far far far away  its an exercise to get there in the first place  but that i guess wont be a problem for those who are already fitness fanatics secondly its location sits in a quiet location in the north west corner from the white house  its walkable but its a decent walk closest metro station is about 10 mins other good things  they have bikes for you to u use to get around dc  which is great cos washington is pretty much flat  its a fantastic way to get around all the monuments etc cos to walk it all will require a decent effort great business centre will free printing with top of the range computers overall a very very pleasant stay,5.0
not what i expected,"i really am confused by the magnolia in denver its got elements that are great and others that are just not imagine for a minute that a luxurious ritz carlton and lowend extended stay hotel got together and had a baby the result would be the magnolia it has some components of true luxury massive suites high ceilings friendly staff great core city location and then elements of extendedstay sleaze weird kitchenettes spotty delivery of service methhead youth hanging out around the entry and lobby that prohibit a good review
the front desk staff was good but i requested an upper floor and was given a room on the second floor of 12 this resulted in a bad nights sleep since the trolley runs by the property all night and rings its bell almost constantly couple that with the yells of weekend drunks and the previously mentioned meth heads and it wasnt a great night 
when staying in cities i prefer to avoid the massive chain hotels and the magnolia is certainly unique in its historical setting and giant suites so i cant give it a bad rating but i also cant highly recommend it",3.0
i will never stay here again,"let me just say i hated this place before i even checked in i was traveling for work and needed a place that accepting the government rate close to the location i would be working in downtown los angeles i knew when i booked this hotel was attached to the mall i had no idea it was in the mall i was traveling solo and upon arriving to the hotel there were three huge tour buses parked out front blocking the check in entrance i was also aware that i would be parking in the mall parking structure after arrival as that is the parking lot the hotel uses i didnt bank on the fact i wouldnt be able to enter into the checkin entrance i tried driving around the block and call the hotel to see what options i had since their entrance was blocked mind you downtown la you cannot park or pull over to the side of the road at any time as there are signs everywhere stating such not sure why three huge buses were the exception the phone rang with no exaggeration for at least three minutes before someone answers mind you i am driving cant pull over anywhere holding my phone and trying to maneuver through streets that dont allow right andor left hand turns at certain times of the day not to mention several one way streets when someone finally answers the phone they ask immediately if i can please hold of course my response was no i cant i asked where i could go to check in since the entrance was still blocked she told me to park in the parking garage next to the hotel and i could enter that way and it would be easy from the elevator 
i do as suggested and pull into the parking garage park near the elevators and think this isnt so bad the elevator will take me right there when i get to the elevator with my luggage purse and other items from my car i realize there are no signs as to what floor to get off on when i get in the elevator there is a button for the bottom floor that says sheraton okay great this works as the elevator stops on other floors there are shoppers people dressed in gym clothes and i realize that we are stopping in the middle of macys department store did i get on the wrong elevator nope when i get to the bottom floor i get out in the middle of the mall i get to drag my suitcase through the shopping mall and as i continue to walk there is a sign as if i am going to a department store that says sheraton at one of the entrances needless to say i am not happy by this point
i check in hiking to myself just relax it will get better from here i go to my room and its okay nothing spectacular but not too bad you can definitely tell they tried their best to update the appearance while being in an old hotel it was clean and doable but definitely been in better i had picked this location thinking it was next to the mall it would be safe for me to find places to eat etc
i am so frustrated i go talk to the manager and nicely explain had it been one thing i could live with my check in issues but i had real issues with not being able to pull in to checkin and not being able to give the bellman my luggage having to pull my luggage through a parking garage through the mall and lastly having them take so long to answer the phone to be told to hold she graciously offered me dinner which i was happy with and not expecting i just wanted her to know tour buses should not be blocking the entrance and they need to pick up the phone anyhow i used it for dinner in the restaurant which turned out to be just as horrible as check in my 30 steak was overcooked chewy and dry the bread they served was as hard as a rock i have had better steaks from chilis grill 
anyhow when i checked out early in the morning a few days later i had to take my suitcase and walk through the quiet and eerie mall and into the parking garage which just as eerie for that early in the morning i didnt like that at all there are too many other choices to have to stay here again in fact next time i will pay some out of my pocket and stay at the omni which is top notch in downtown los angeles",2.0
comfy and priced right,i stayed here during a convention at the george brown center the suite was half the cost of the other hotels near the convention center my suite had a kitchen with a full size refrigerator stove microwave sink dish soap paper towels dish drainer and cabinets the table had two full place settings of nice china and tableware the wifi was free the bed was new and very comfortable the suite was clean and had everything i needed and more the staff was very courteous and helpful breakfast was cold items toaster provided just what a busy traveler needs to hold him over until lunch warning there is no elevator but the staff carried my luggage up and down the stairs the vending machines were not operating but they did have out of order signs on them the ice machines were also not operating but the suite had a freezer and ice cube trays the neighborhood was not scary one block to the east was the toyota center where the houston rockets played the night i arrived one block to the north on carolina was a the houston pavilion a building with several restaurants three blocks to the north on austin was the houston center a building with a food court across from there was the phoenician an interesting ethnic grocery and restaurant the convention center was a 510 minute walk however stop lights are timed against pedestrians not the fault of the hotel,4.0
not a bad airport hotel,"make sure to confirm your room preference and bed type with the hotel ahead of time or pick another property to stay i had a bit of drama trying to get a room with two beds and manager had to intervene to solve my problem apparently reservations are only a request and dont really constitute a reservation this shows poor hotel management and puts unnecessary stress on guests during checkin process if i book a room with two beds i expect to get a room with two beds period
the rooms are clean with refreshed carpet furniture and flat panel tv with plenty of towels and amenities my only issue was with the bed it seems like an old mattress a little wobbly with not much support and padding its a shame if you change the mattress with a good quality support it would be a very comfortable hotel
both valet parking and selfparking are outrageously expensive if the room is 100 per night does it make sense to charge 30 of the daily room rate for valet parking and 15 for internet access",3.0
i would highly recommend this hotel,my husband and i spent two nights here from 1120 to 1122 the room was clean and rather spacious for a nyc hotel room the bathroom was a nice size i wasnt a big fan of the half open shower  unless i stood right under the shower head i felt the cool air of the rest of the bathroom the bed was super comfortable and we both had great nights of sleep i would definately stay here again we were going to events at msg so the location was super convenient plus we were in walking distance to attractions in chelsea we wanted to explore,4.0
i loved every minute there they made me feel at home,"the location is great the stuff is warm and friendly the room was large and comfortable 
i had a problem with not receiving a package that was sent to me and the hotel service manager tried to help me far beyond his duty",5.0
comfy bed terrible bathroom lighting,"my husband  i stayed here for 4 nights while he was attending a conference in may our room was on the 4th floor with a view of the river the view would have been excellent except for the moisture in the windows which blurred the view it was a nice room but not a 4 star room i would give it 3 12 stars 
the bed was very comfortable  we did get a king room which my husband had requested also good fluffy pillows however our bathroom seemed old the lighting was very dim  not good for shaving or putting on makeup i stopped by the front desk  mentioned it to the girl on duty she was very pleasant  confirmed that a number of people had complained about the lights 
we liked its location  were able to walk to many places like the art institute of chicago millenium park the magnificent mile etc the one evening when my husband had a business dinner i walked to the oriental theatre by myself to see wicked which id highly recommend 
we used the concierge services 2 times  received good service the concierge desks are setup like podiums close to the main checkin area",4.0
my favorite place to stay in nyc,ive been staying at on the ave for about 5 years and rarely stray while larger than a boutique hotel it has the same feel the rooms are small but well furnished and the beds are wonderful the staff is always friendly and helpful and the neighborhood is much quieter than those lower in manhattan the hotel is at 77th and broadway and theres a subway stop less than 2 blocks away at 79th though the hotel lacks a restaurant there are a number of terrific places to eat within blocks nice matin at 79th and amsterdam and sarabeths at 80th and amsterdam both serve wonderful breakfastsand theres a shake shack at 77th and columbus not to mention zabars just a few blocks away at 81st and broadway the upper west side is a wonderful place to stay in the city and on the ave is the best hotel there,4.0
the palace made us feel like royalty,our daughter is a senior at academy of art and the palace would be our choice if just for convenience and amenities  best spasauna pool in city next to bart stop and easily walkable and easy taxi to where we need to go when you add people like teresa and scott in desk and management lydia in the spa it becomes such a pleasure my wife celebrated her birthday this visit and by mentioning it we were sent up chocolate strawberries and a breakfast tray there may be newer hipper properties in sf but if you appreciate the historical aspects of the city and embrace elegant style the palace is the place to stay,5.0
what a revival ,"the hotel was renovated with taste by a flamboyant french designertop concierge service and beautiful frederic fekkai hair salon on 2nd floor 
beautiful white marble bathrooms but kitchenette micro wave fridge etc can be seen from bednot very romantic  heatersac hidden behind curtains once you shut those at night tv screens small and electronic system rather complicatedtop materials used for refurbishingthereforeoverall was satisfactory",4.0
a home run,it seems that the people running this oneyearold hotel got everything right excellent location clean modern and spacious rooms the highlight being the beautifully appointed bathroom with the large window for natural sunlight terrific outdoor pool and terrace on the 7th floor but most of all outstanding service a staff that is always smiling and helpful indicates a pleasant work environment congratulations,5.0
high priced clean friendly and great staff and location,i recently stayed at the taj located on newbury street and loved it from the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the vallet attendents to the looby staff and maids the glits and glammer was all over it cathes your eye the hotel is big with only 15 floors and a rooftop garden a beautiful state of the art fitness center and a chanel store located in the lobby the rooms were nice too with a huge bathroom and great beds overalll the hotel was suberb and serine,5.0
great value for money excellent location if you dont want city center,a friend and i recently stayed here for a weekend booked with little knowledge trough priceline but we could not have been more thrilled loved the atmosphere of being in a collegiate area yet super easy to get into the city center on the subway though some people tried to warn us not to use the subway as residents of new york london we couldnt see the issue  not as extensive as larger citys its clean and works we didnt try the service  great deal but contact with all staff was good would definitely go back the living room is a lovely space to chill out in,5.0
staff was excellent,staff was excellent rooms were clean and comfortable,4.0
not that great,stayed here for 3 nights the room was large which was nice having the kitchen fully stocked with dishes was a bonus for newly renovated the couch had holes and our feet were black from the carpet if we did not wear shoes there is not enough parking for the units unless most of the rooms had more than one car we were always on the side street i was also charged more than my confirmation quoted but my check out clerk would not change it,2.0
another great stay in the heart of the magmile,booked for 3 nights to kick off the holidaysperfect location with quiet entrance on rush and most views facing michigan plus a nordstrom connected right to it what could be better the staff is gracious and sincere and the hotel has a cozy feel to it even in the middle of the magmile madness around it nice touch is tea or hot cocoa by the elevator hall although we requested a coffeemakerkeurig in our room and it was kept full with a nice assortment of coffeesteas at no charge room service can be pricey 26 for an omelette including all fees but very very good even at 330am when i was starving we stay here several times a year and are never disappointed our room had a view all the way to the lake so we were able to enjoy the holiday lighting all the way down michigan and the bed big cushy mushy pillows and a nice down comforter for a great sleep decent shower and good bath products including an upon request shanghai tang bath amenity yum cosi is across the street for a quick bite or bringback to the room snack and a good variety of restaurants are everywhere the concierge staff is terrific nice girls who know the city and gave us great suggestions go to the conrad chicago now,5.0
nice hotel good location,we stayed her over the weekend and spend some time in downtown chicago the rooms are good and clean roomservice is good too the location is grwat right around the corner of the magnificent mile surley would come back here,4.0
beyond tiny ,1 nite at the hotel andra for a mariners ballgame could not believe the size of the bathroom  tiniest i have ever seen including ones on cruise ships  room suite was satisfactory but definitely not what i would call a suite beds were comfortable however except be careful of the frame they are in as it is sharp  easy to run into convenient for travel to safeco field via the new central link probably would not recommend this hotel to a friend nor would i plan on staying there again not worth the price  including the very spendy valet parking,3.0
new attitude at the w,dont let other reviews steer you away from this gem yes the rooms are small but they are very comfortable and interesting location is perfect for museums restaurants and theater the bed towels pillows and shower were first rate best of all was the service every staff member was warm friendly and helpful the parking attendant front desk staff cleaning staff and conciege could not have been nicer thanks to them we had a terrific weekend in nyc,5.0
got more than i paid for,i got a great deal on hotwire but was nervous after reading the reviews when i checked in i presented the front desk staff with a starwood preferred guest card and was upgraded to a deluxe room on the 22nd floor of the newly refurbished tower the floor was designated starwood preferred guests and it was perfect i requested turndown service after hours and someone was sent immediately the room was very nice the heavenly bed wonderful the views were incredible and coffee and tea was free i felt very safe being on my own and the location of the hotel is the best i would not hesitate to go back to this hotel the spafitness center was very good also,5.0
no thrills no frills,"the good stuff first
the best thing about this hotel is its location right next to the rivercenter mall and right behind the alamo and its just a short walking distance from the riverwalk this was our 2nd time staying here both times our rooms were very spacious and nicely decorated 
now the not so good 
it cost 25 a day for valet parkingno in room safe i didnt want to carry a purse around all day but i was worried about leaving it in my room and not being able to lock it up we were told we would get a full breakfast when we booked but actually it was a continental breakfastskip it too many people just to get a waffle the ac would not cool the room had it down as far as 68 and it still would not cool the room the room had this musty moldy smell to it everytime we would leave and come back you could smell it the curtains were replaced with shutters which let light in as soon as it was daylight outside housekeeping never cleaned the bathtub just wiped it dry leaving long hair behind  the hair did not belong to either of us everything they wiped left hair in order to flush the toilet you had to hold the handle down the entire time waitting for it to flush 
you have to use your room keycard in order for the elavator to workfor safety everytime we got in the elavator there was people trying to figure it out and just sitting in the elavator because it wont budge if you dont do it right the front desk clerk was rude and was even arguing with a guest that was trying to check in we decided that it would be better to pay a little extra for a better hotel than to be stressed when were trying to have a nice little getaway weeknend we just happen book when there was a special going on and got it at a good price i have seen better hotels with better amenities for less  spend the extra 50 or 60 dollars just to have peace of mind",3.0
great stay for the price,this was my second stay at this property in the last 3 months and i can easliy say that it will not be the last the service and the grounds are impeccable the beds are quite comfortable although just as the previous reviewer i too confirmed a king bed and was given two doubles instead i did not question the room switch since it was just me staying for the 3 nights the restaurant on the property is very good a little pricey but very good the first night i stayed i had the braised short rib risottoridiculously good overall this was an excellent trip and i would recommend to business travelers who like spacious rooms and great service,4.0
charlotte ocr 2012,my wifes plane was stuck in chicago and i called to ask if i could check out around 4pm and have the days charges removed since i needed to drive home be with the kids i was told no  even though there were plenty of rooms available the manager on duty didnt seem to care about my situation and when i said i may stay at another hotel in future during my frequent trips to charlotte she didnt comment i contacted customer service and received a call back from the general manager who took the charges off the bill in the end i called a friend to drive over and spend the night with my kids and i stayed an additional day i may try another hotel when i come back for a week in december,4.0
not cheap no freebies but a good facility,"i was here for a training event recently the meeting facilities and service were both top notch the rooms were very nice as well nothing over the top fancy but nice
they advertise 10 a day wifi but they gave me the code on checkin this couldve been due to my training class or pc membership though however it was incredibly slow i used my 3g all week instead 
they have an onsite restaurant but the breakfast buffet after tip was about 15 too pricey for me
there was a mini fridge in the room but no microwave 
overall a nice facility but across the street connected by skywalks is the drury plaza which has free breakfast internet evening reception etc if i had to come back i try that instead
also it was a bit pricey",4.0
highly recommend definitely would return,owner ron and staff were most cordial and helpful neighborhood was interesting inviting and safe room was very comfortable easy to get downtown on nearby train close to a major tennis club continental breakfast was quite sufficient wendall w,5.0
good location and price,not much to add to the other reviews great location embedded among some of the most interesting buildings in chicago check in was fast and they gave me the room early the small room is just big enough for two adults quiet and nice,4.0
decent but older property,a bit rundown and there was an ant problem in the bathroom servicable stop if you need to stay close to the airport they allow long term parking on their lot for free which was a big plus,2.0
a quirky hotel with character,we originally were reccomended to stay at the hotel monaco another kimpoton hotel but it was booked out this turned out to be on the next corner from the seranno if i could i would suggest staying at the monaco as a preference it has a more interesting lobby and restaurant  bar downstairs that being said the seranno was a good hotel with some interesting quirks such as the afternoon drinks done at all kimpton hotels the street around the corner was a little rough and once discovered we did avoid it the rooms are a little on the smaller side but good amenities and extra touches such as the yoga bag and exercise classes on the tv a good hotel and worth considering,4.0
great stay great location,we stayed at the intercontinental for one night in june and also for a few nights last september we enjoyed both stays very much the location is excellent we were here for a concert in millennium park and could walk to the concert and all the shopping we wanted to do the train station is at the park also so we walked and stored our bags with the bellman parking is ridiculously expensive a previous reviewer mentioned they thought the hotel was noisy so we were worried when we got off the elevator and realized our room was right there i thought for sure i wouldnt be able to sleep however i didnt hear a thing at all we kept our air on so maybe that helped the hotel is clean the pool is large but not for kids the staff was extremely friendly no complaints,4.0
even better than expected,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the strand the room was comfortable the bed was sublime the staff was friendly and accommodating and our view of the empire state building was spectacular the breakfast was quite extensive dinner in the restaurant was delicious sometimes the service was a little disorganized as when our wine and chocolates part of our package werent in the room when we arrived and only one chocolate was left at turndown two of the three nights actually rather funny three computers are in the business office only two of them worked so there is usually no need to wait for someone to finish we would definitely stay there again,5.0
didnt stay here but staff was lovely and helpful,"i had a last minute cancellation to my bosss reservation due to the storms in the north east we made the reservation through expedia and it was a sameday cancellation so i thought we were doomed for sure in terms of getting a refund but everyone i spoke with was very kind and helpful from the reservations agent to the front desk agent to the manager ryan
we got a full refund because wed been flattened by hurricane sandy and then the noreaster and were unable to travel i know this was a onetime kind of thing but i so appreciated their willingness to take our circumstances into account when making their decision my boss was really impressed and well definitely be staying there in future",5.0
would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone,the hotel is old and smelly and dirty i originally asked for a nonsmoking room and they gave us a stinky dirty old room i requested the front desk for antoher room and was told that they normally wouldnt change the room but eventually they gave me another room the new room still smelled bad with the wall papers peeling and the popcorn ceiling falling all over the coffee pot it was disgusting but since the hotel had no other rooms available i couldnt request to be moved again the air conditioning got my teenage son sick  the bathroom is small with molds on the ceiling and the beds are old and lumpy i could go on and on and on the only good thing was the location  it was walking distance to 5th avenue,1.0
horrible marriot stay away,i stayed at the houston marriott texas medical center for two nights on business this hotel is right in the texas medical center complex the hotel is old and outdated the lobby is probably the nicest place in the entire hotel although i didnt eat in any of the restaurants their decor looked like it was about 2030 years old not so much dirty and worn but just the color style and decor the rooms were terrible the first room that i was given stunk of moisture and mildue immediately upon entering when i asked to be transferred to another room they did so with no questions however the new room on a different floor also smelled musty and of mildue i met another person in the elevator that saw me changing rooms and immediately knew why as he had also experience a smelly room and had changed to no avail in addition to the musty smell througout the entire hotel the rooms were small old and the carpet looked like it had been in place for decades it was all dirty and matted and disgusting the beds were comfortable and room service was great there is also almost no good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel they do offer a free shuttle within 2 miles but it is unreliable they charge 995 for high speed internet access for 24 hours but they have no wireless i would not stay here again choose another hotel in the same area there are plenty of them i would suggest the crowne plaza or the hilton the room rate was good at 109 but i would definitly pay more for an acceptable room,1.0
the ritz in chicago is the best,"we have stayed in the ritz in chicago many of times and have never been disappointed our kids are really treated well from the time they get there at checkin they are allowed to pick out a toy out of the wagon they wheel around when they arrive in the room there is a goodie basket for them with colors and a cookie
there is a tour they can take of the kitchen and bake cookies with the chef  although we haven t had a chance to do this 
the beds are incredible and get turned down every night
the employees are fantastic also
there is also a great little park right across the street for the kids
this is our all time favorite place to stay",5.0
awesome staff and services,"i really love the location of this property it is quiet as well as easy on your wallet the staff is by far the best out of any of the hotels i have ever stayed in nationwide always professional friendly and helpful with any of your needs i always feel welcome and comfortable here rooms bathrooms and kitchenettes are always clean and everything appliances water lights etc is always working properly and efficiently
i know the property will undergo renovations soon and i am sure that it will only enhance the guest experience
many thanks to samantha simmons for the handwritten note left for me upon my arrival such awesome customer service",5.0
full service hotel,i travel quite a bit i have stayed here before the hotel has everything you need the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful good restaurant choices on premises rooms great to work in,5.0
an incredible unique gem with a staff to match,this new hotel far exceeded my expectations an absolutely unique atmosphere of modern convenience blended seamlessly with an old world elegance every experience with the over the top staff was positive and satisfying our stunning suite had a living room and 2 bedrooms with a bar area and windows overlooking both city hall  penn center our room was in credibly quiet with wonderfully comfortable beds and linens complete with 3 big screen plasma televisions service was top notch in every aspect when we returned from an evening out with our dinner doggy bags we realized we had no refrigerator at one oclock in the morning i phoned down to the front desk and not even 10 minutes later a staff member showed up with a fridge this type of service is what we experienced from all of the staff for our entire 3 day stay when i am in philly this hotel will be my home away from home every time just superb,5.0
loved this hotel,loved this hotel rooms were beautiful and clean breakfast was great convenient location dont stay in san antonio if youre not going to stay on the riverwalk it is too beautiful to miss the staff was so wonderful we arrived early and they were able to store our luggage until we came back from shopping i would definitely stay here again,5.0
a great place to stay in dc,this hotel was the perfect location within walking distance to the white house and the mall also across from a metro stop for tired children at the end of the day we walked back to the hotel one night rather late and felt very safe the hotel is very clean and well kept the indoor pool though small was a plus for the kids the restaurant in the hotel was pretty good too we would definitely stay there again,4.0
millenium hotels are the pits,"ive stayed in many hotels in my time but this is at the top of my list as the worst hotel i have ever stayed in 
there are much better hotels in the area for a lot less than they charge and which include clean rooms and courteous staff i will never stay in a millenium hotel again",1.0
great views and downtown location,stayed here two nights with my husband while he had to be in town for business the hotel is in a great location with access to everything downtown everyone at the hotel was very helpful and friendly when we inquired about places to eat and things to see in town the gym at the hotel was very nice with new equipment and a view to die for the room was a good size and the bed quite comfy overall i say it is a very nice hotel if you are in town for business at the convention center but if you dont need to be right there all the time i think you can find a better value in another hotel,4.0
loved everything,"the entrance was modern and spectacular the check in virtually unnoticeable the ambiance was fantastic and overwhelmed with the detailsone did not notice the friendly agents 
the room was clean bed linen fresh ver nice rooms with all the modern equipment bathrooms cleanbed and comforter very comfortable
the breakfast was very good and the waitresses very nice a little disappointed that there were very few options for those of us that do not eat pork this could potentially become a problem if one prepays for breakfast and then given few choices",5.0
westin great place to stay,i was at the westin for 5 days of a conference it was my third stay there and i have never been disappointed the location is wonderful for all the times square things to do and convenient to restaurants cafes and delis the conference is at the hotel and is always well handled by the hotel i have never had a complaint to make while staying there and would stay there with my family if we should visit nyc,4.0
great service,have stayed at this hotel couple of times now and have not been disappointed once the staff here are friendly and fantastic and would always go out of there way to make me happy rooms are clean large and stylish with very comfortable beds the kitchen bar in room was a bit different at first but now i find it very convenient the location is right across from the galleria but would not be an ideal hotel for a family holiday would gladly recommend the meridian if you are on business in the area,5.0
the best hotel for otakon,we stayed here for the otakon anime convention we selected the hilton because of the connected walkway to the convention center which was great also many of the convention events took place in the hiltons conference rooms check in was super fast with the kiosk in the lobby self parking was 26 a day steep but on par for other hotels in the area nice room good room service nice hd tv with hd programming but it kept cutting out now and then with the satellite reception the pool and hot tub and spa were clean and very nice room was quiet clean and comfortable check out on the tv no problems great hotel,5.0
your valubles are not safe at the westin,"i recently stayed at the westin  charlotte on business i am a consultant and travel often i left for dinner one evening and when i returned my room had been burglarized the perpetrators took close to 850 dollars in personal items and another 1800 in company items 
since then they have given me the runaround having me contact their insurance agency and after three weeks simply denied any liability for the lack of safety in their rooms their excuse they dont know how someone could have gotten in 
if you like to get your stuff stolen stay at the westin they will be happy to accommodate you",1.0
not even close to 5 star,"stayed here over thanksgiving weekend the lobby had a beautiful tall christmas tree that was quite welcoming however with the not so friendly staff and illinformed conceirge the hotel scored very low on service from my point of view i asked a simple question to both the front desk and the conceirge and the door man if they knew if i could street park over night without even trying to find out all of them total of 6 people quickly said i dont know but you can park in the garage across the street which would have cost me over 65 a night 
fyi parking is available on the street from 6pmmidnight via meter everyday midnight to 7ammidweek 8am weekend parking is available for free take advantage of that
ive requested for 2 beds on a higher level floor not next to the elevators ignoring all of my requests i got a king size bed on the 3rd floor right next to the elevators talk about catering to the customers requests
tiny room and tiniest bathroom ive ever seen at a five star hotel in my room with one king bed there was barely any room to walk around though the room has all the necessary amenities such as iron coffee pot hair dryer etc how can you enjoy a cup of coffee when theres not enough space to sit how can you iron your shirt when you have no place to lay out your clothes
the fitness center and the steam roomsauna is very small and not very clean
the heater made weird cranking noises all night the outside noise though expected since its nyc was quite obtrusive since we were on 3rd floor 
to top it all off the hotels location isnt so convenient it is quite a walk to a subway station and park street nor 48th has anything to see or do there is a deli at the corner of the street but it had terrible food if youre going to nyc in the winter when its brutally cold to walk outside dont stay here unless you want to cab around the city
for the amount of money i paid to stay here over 300 a night the service and amenities were not up to par i would never choose the intercontinental barclay again and unless you get a super duper very good deal i would not recommend this hotel",1.0
good hotel and service,stayed here for 4 nights and was very happy the aircon controls on the wall werent working at first but the battery was replaced and it was fine after that there is a subway station right on the corner of the block which is very convenient for getting down to the village and its only a couple of blocks from other lines the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the free wifi was also a bonus the room was very quiet and i never heard any sound from the adjacent rooms and couldnt hear any traffic noise but that might have been because my room was at the back so this is a very reasonably priced clean comfortable hotel that ia a great base for exploring midtown,4.0
better options for less unless you need a kitchen,"the hotel is right across from phillys gorgeous city hall thats pretty much all i can say for it the lobby has extremely low ceilings and feels dark and musty the second floor bar area is much more what you would expect from a lobby our corner room had one of the weirdest layouts ive ever seen with a small kitchenette and living room tiny sleeping area and oddly configured bathroom the room was straight out of 1995 and the furniture showed it wifi was fast and free as for the breakfast it only is offered til 10am on the weekends so by the time we got up and down there we were out of luck ive never seen a hotel where breakfast stops at 10 on the weekend before
the hotel was very crowded and boisterous and i could see staying there if you needed a kitchenette for some reason otherwise the courtyard next door  which was the same price  looked much nicer other hotels are in the nicer rittenhouse square area for the same or less",2.0
probably the best budget hotel  ever,we stayed for a week and it almost felt like home for me as my boyfriend was working i explored the city on my own the parks location right behind union square was great for this with loads of shops bus routes and chinaown close by i felt really safe to walk around and rodel was so helpful he had a great sollution for every question i had the room was exactly what i wanted clean well appointed with a nice bathroom and plenty of space i wasnt expecting there to be a kitchen but this too was excellently equipped and a real bonus as were the laundry facilities i wouldnt hesitate to recommend the park hotel to anyone especially travellers on a budget who nevertheless maintain high standards,5.0
forget the benjamin stay at doubletree or the michelangelo,we stayed at the benjamin during the easter weekend in a one bedroom suite i based my decision to stay there largely on the reviews from this site and the virtual tour on the hotels website both are misleading the benjamin is just an ok hotel nothing special just like any other hotel they have some employees who provide great service like our doorman jonathan who is probably the best doorman in new york and then mediocre to bad service like when we checked in we were promised a room with a view and were told no rooms had a view an outright lie but being on vacation i decided not to get upset and just make the best of it the room is much smaller than the one shown on the virtual tour and does not have windows on both sides it was reasonably clean and the decor was nice but thats all the bathroom was tiny cramped and annoying the location is ok but is by no means prime its a good fifteen minutes to times square or central park we paid 289night including parking although they tried to charge for parking upon check out but then quickly corrected it for a business trip if you have to be in that location the benjamin is fine for vacation youre much better off at the doubletree the rooms are much bigger and the view and location much better if you dont care about the view then stay at the michelangelo around the same price look for deals on their website or other online sights with an upgrade included and the one bedroom suite clobbers the benjamins you cant even compare the two the michelangelo is that much better hope this helps,3.0
loved the bryant park hotel,the bryant park hotel was absolutely stunning in appearance we stayed for a wedding sept 16 and 17th in a junior suite i just need to say how accomodating sweet and friendly everyone was to us as well as the bride and groom and other wedding guests staying at the hotel darren and eric l were fantastic and made our stay so comfortable the staff will go above and beyond for their guests the neighborhood is also fabulous so close to times square and 5th ave directly across the street from gorgeous bryant park if you love boutique type hotels this is the place for you worth the price,4.0
convenient location and great service,this hotel is in a very convenient location i was in town on business and it was an easy walk to my office with a lot of choices for coffee on the way it is also an easy walk to fanueil hall the north end and close to the t if needed the rooms themselves were fine functional and clean the fitness room was better than i expected and was super clean had new equiptment towels and water the staff was also very helpful and friendly they organised a car at my departure and also emailed me a copy of my receipt within a couple of hours as i lost mine i definitely thought this could take a couple of days while not a luxury hotel i would happily stay here again the only caution is that it is in the financial district so on the weekends a lot of the cafes and restaurants arent open,4.0
a lovely friendly place to stay,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this marriott hotel staff were extremely helpful other than the lady on the hertz rentacar desk having said that we did complain about her to the concierge manager and she was a bit friendlier the next day concierge help was excellent american service at its best our room was clean and spacious except for the bathroom which was a little poky bed so comfortable the maids were happy and courteous and sometimes made little designs on the bed for us breakfast was good value omelettes were scrumptious maybe some of the staff at the poolside restaurant could have been a little nicer especially when they were closing down at night overall very happy and we would stay here again as we will definitely return to san diego what a fantastic city ,5.0
this is a fabulous resort,"great servicevery accomodating
we were here in mid september it wasnt crowded but there is plenty of property if it were
the three walking paths offer light medium or strenuous workouts if walking is not your style there is a fabulous gym 
the rooms are luxurious with grand bathrooms and inviting beds",5.0
good location for midtown manhattan,we got last minute reservations for saturday december 3 to see the christmas lights in new york the last minute rates were expensive  459 plus tax  but we splurged the location is excellent and the rooms arent too small the shower is tiny but the accommodatiions are normal new york but the location cant be beaten for sightseeing you are at the corner of west 31 and 6th avenue right around the corner from madison square garden macys and penn station nice staff at hotel and breakfast plus coffee tea and hot chocolate overall it was a good last minute choice,3.0
upscale hotel with a reasonable room rate,"we overnighted at the us grant after our panama canal cruise we chose the hotel online as it was in the gaslamp district which we heard was an entertaining area to stay in close to shopping and restaurants with a reasonable price 14200 per night the hotel is a 100 years old but has been beautifully restored our room was comfortable clean and was completely updated 
staff were very courteous professional and helpful 
unfortunately the day we arrived was american thanksgiving so all the stores and most of the attractions that san diego is famous for were closed we did not eat in the hotels restaurant as it was completely booked so can not offer a comment on the food other than to say the menu looked enticing but be prepared to part with at least 20000 if you order an appetizer a main and like to enjoy a bottle of wine with your spouse
we still enjoyed our stay and would recommend others explore using this hotel",5.0
unsure about this one,"i am unsure about this hotel we booked it after reading the great reviews on tripadvisor and weve never been let down by any of the properties that weve found this way until the fusion
ou main issue with the property was the noise not from the street but the people in the rooms next to us the walls sound like they are made of paper we could hear everything from the other rooms talking tvs phones people using the bathroom  and i do not mean the hotel plumbing nothing was left to the imagination on top of that the noise from above rooms sounded like elephants were racing round and round
the weather was warm while we were there so we wanted the window open  we had an internal room but the noise from the other rooms with their windows open meant it wasnt an option we ended up having to use ear plugs for the entire stay
we were offered another room but when we went to check it out the tv next door was blaring so it wasnt a viable option
the other issue we had was the house keeping when we checked in the room was immaculate however after that it went downhill we reuse our towels so didnt want them replaced every day however some days they would take towels and not replace them at all the floor wasnt vacuumed for about 3 days breakfast crumbs stayed for the whole weekend 
on the plus side the location was brilliant you could walk to shops the cable car restaurants the information centre and transport
im not sure if we just got them at an off time as previous reviews have been excellent but i would struggle to recommend the hotel to to family and friends
sorry for the late review we have been travelling since then",3.0
excellent value for the money,"i was in charlotte for a night for a tennis tournament and traveling with my three kids i booked a 2 room suite 2 queen beds and a sofabed with full kitchen for 75 
at that price point you are never sure what you are going to get i was very pleased with 1 the cleanliness of the room especially the bathroom and kitchen 2 the sofabed had clean sheets and a pillow cant always count on that 3 the staff was very helpful and accommodating 4 the pool was clean and we had no problems getting towels from the front desk 5 free wired and wireless internet in the room there was an option to pay for a faster speed but i didnt have a problem with the speed of the free service i even took my laptop to the pool and worked there with no problem
the breakfast was serviceable for 75 i dont expect cooked to order breakfast with my kids as long as you have a waffle maker you are good and they did the dining area was clean which is most important to me
of course at this price there are going to be some small things that you wish could be better the sofa and chair in our room had some stains on them the office chair wobbled a bit the walls were a bit thin and so sounds from other rooms echoed around a bit one of our neighbors called the front desk to complain that we were making too much noise even though the noise was coming from the room on the floor above if you are a light sleeper that could be an issue it didnt bother me or my kids
but relative to the positives i note above these were minor problems i would stay again for sure",4.0
great fun and relaxing at the best,stayed there for 5 nites in may 2011 would go back in a heartbeat they treat you extremely well and make your stay a time to remember,5.0
great location nice accommodations good priceline deal,typical city hotel so you have to pay for internet and breakfast but we enjoyed our stay plenty of cafes nearby for reasonable breakfast food and free internet,4.0
great downtown memphis location,"great location if you like staying in the city the hotel is located a few blocks from beale street and just a few steps from the rendezvous rib joint
the staff is friendly and helpful my room was clean and nicely appointed the only meal i had there was breakfast and well it was breakfast nice lounge with friendly bartender is adjacent to the lobby
the only complaint i have is that the the hotel shuttle vans with the hotel name on them will not take you to the airport or anywhere else unless you are part of an airline crew it cost about 30 plus tip for a taxi to or from the airport so you can expect to add about 75 to the cost of staying here if you need transportation i will have to do some research to see if there is another downtown hotel with an airport shuttle",4.0
great location  very clean,i stayed here with my 2 teenage daughters we loved the location room was very clean and spacious for a room in nyc 2 queen beds great front desk service speedy check out parking garage just accross the street the breakfast was basicsimple continental breakfast but it was all we needed  and it was fresh capuccino machine was surprisingly good staff was very knowledgable in helping us get around even helped arrange our transportation back to the hotel i will come back and stay at this hotel hopefully soon,4.0

loved the affinia,my wife and i have just returned from a four night stay in the affinia and i have to say that apart from the superb location which is close to everything in downtown manhattan the staff are second to none they helped to make my first stay in new york very enjoyable my wife had stayed there before and i understand now why she wanted to go back keep up the good work,5.0
great for the price,just returned from 6 days at the time very good service and excellent location for going to the theatre close to everything walking distance or one stop away on the the subway also great places to eat from nyc good and cheap to very special and very expensive very close by the room is on the small side but comfortable clean and kept that way daily didnt really use the lounge or bar was a very busy place at theatre time for what we paid for the room it was greata few little things like the shower light going on and off we called it the shower ghost and had to check to see the door fully closed other than that a very helpful and friendly staff willing to take the extra few steps to get you what you need or lead you in the right direction could have stayed in a hotel with a bigger room and paid twice the price buy why if your in nyc and staying in your room or eating at places that they have in your home town you might as well have stayed at home have a great time get out and see it all,4.0
avoid this hotel,folks beware this is basically a residential hotel complete with the nuts that inhabit such a hotel i was put in a room next to two boom box bozos who boomed their music all hours of day and night the staff could not handle them there was construction work being done in the room above me and next to me the walls felt as though they would cave in the staffers a joe and patrice are surly and you just know they hated being in the public when i asked for an extra blanket they said i had one although i told them i wanted another one i was begrudenly given a smoked hole rag for a blanket i left with fleas after many many complaints i was finally moved after i asked for the manager the other room had no view other than all the other windowss off the residents forget about getting any sleep at all do not waste your money staying here,1.0
a lovely unexpected surprise,i was in lajolla and wanted to spend my last night of the trip closer to san diego because id never explored the city i found the bristol hotel on the web and got a 159 rate which i thought was great location was perfect the staff were very helpful calling for cabs giving me directions and my room was very nice the bathrooms were a nice size and the lobby was pleasant to sit in i would highly recommend this hotel to others,5.0

before the cruise,our room was a corner suite with 2 windows overlooking the water boats and the airport which is just across the portharbor since it was our anniversary i booked the sweetheart deal which included chocolate covered strawberries champagne and breakfast the next morning all of this was beautifully presented and quite tasteful the bed was great with a very comfortable mattress the bathroom was spotless and wifi was flawless we were taking a cruise the following day and were able to hitch a ride to the cruiseport and other than the extra taxes and fees that are customary to the area it was a fantastic choice for us,5.0
beautiful hotel and rooms but service concierge valet lacking,"best points proximity to waterfront and other attractions beautiful historic hotel very clean room small but functional fitness center
notsogreat 1 parking fees exorbitant like most downtown hotels 2 walls are thin i could hear people having a conversation in the next room and people down the hallway sounded like they were right outside the door 3service was bad concierge i tried using the concierge 3 times and all 3 were unpleasant experiences i called down once to ask what bus to take and after being on hold for a couple of minutes they told me to come down to the desk where i waited for 10 minutes ran out of time and had to leave second and third tries unsuccessful as well bell service i felt like the bellman was very rude after i gave him his gratuity 
overall i got a great price on the hotel so it was well worth it it is a beautiful centrallylocated hotel the french boulangerie down the street is delightful",3.0
incredibly comfortable and the staff was awesome they took care of our team,"highly recommended thats all you should take away from this
we booked a bunch of rooms when our team was in denver for the sia trade show the hotel was really comfortable there is room to meet with your crew and have a drink i thought the staff went above and beyond to take care of us especially taylor at the valet he helped us get our huge marketing truck in the building when it wouldnt fit through the normal gates
i felt like the value of the rooms was incredible we had to book a couple rooms at the last minute after our party and ended up getting a better rate than the group one we set up i will definitely be looking at this when we want to come down for the night to see a show or go to a game",5.0
fabulous hotel,"the omni is a great hotel nice area close to the metro station rooms are great didnt eat in the restaurant but did eat in the bar and the food was very good and actually very good value the bar is a nice place with a good athmosphere which is greatly helped by some excellant waiting staff
found the coffee shop in the foyer to be expensive and the staff in it are the only ones who let the side down
you have free internet access in the lobby but will have to pay to access it in your room
one word of warning this is a big hotel and covers a large area so your room can be quite a way from reception and the entrance and there are also various split levels meaning steps so if you have limited mobility it may not be the best choice",5.0
wonderful attention,when i arrived at the hotel i was given a room on the 11th floor i need antivet drugs to travel so i did not notice until the next day that the elevator gave me vertigo the staff moved us immediately to a lower floor and accommodated me each time i needed to come and go because i needed to use the stairs the staff was exceptionally nice and i never really had to wait very long for someone to get me up the stairs to my new room i give them an a for being so wonderful,5.0

nice hampton inn,stayed at this hampton inn for 4 nights late feb hotel is completing finishing touches on renovations outside does not look like typical hampton as it is clad in yellow painted wood siding the location is convenient but not the best area but seems typical for san diego area inside areas are nice they finished the lobby wall paper while we were there pool and hot tub area looked nice and heated but still did not used due to outside temps in upper 50s stayed in a newly renovated large king with brand new carpet had that new carpet smell each time we went in room had patio minifridge microwave nice granite counters new popular style furniture grade vanity new furniture and new white bedding and pillows that all hamptons are getting note that only the larger king rooms have the microwave fridge and patio or balcony housekeeping starts early in the morning and the room was always clean breakfast area is roomy with granite tables and counters and additional seeting just beyond in the lobby area so there was always a table to be had breakfast was typical hampton and not bad for what you get 1 hot entree each day wafflesausage eggsausagebiscuit eggbagel good fresh fruit salad whole bananas and apples cerials excellent coffee yogurt coffee cake bagels and bread muffins milk and the typical reconstituting orangeapplecranberry juice machine the breakfast staff always kept everything filled before running out hotel is very close to old town but i still wouldnt walk there through all the major roads in between other than the few restaurants in old town and several mexican restaurants we found no very nice restaurants within a few miles of the hotel mostly fast food and chains seems like most of the good restaurants are down in the gas lamp quarter would stay there again if staying in the area,3.0
clean and friendly,we just got back yesterday from our trip to san franciscjuly 1606 want everyone to know our stay at the fusion was great staff was very friendly and suggested great places to eat it was very clean everytime the maid came to clean it looked like the first time we got there everything was in its place although the rooms were small they were very cozy and we had a flat screen tv too we would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and anyone who is still deciding where to stay it is also close to all the great shopping and restaurants we will definitely consider staying there again we want to thank the staff at the fusion for making us feel welcome especially rich who recommended we eat at boca and peppe great restaurant for kids too hope to see you again,4.0

nice hotel in a great location,"whenever i am at a convention at the grb convention center i always try for this hotel it is usually less expensive than anything in the area it is nice it has a hot free breakfast and great free wireless internet my only complaints are that there are only a couple of restaurants within a few blocks of course not their fault and the room heatac is pretty loud  but that drowns out any noise from the freeway
it would also be great for the toyota center and not bad for minute maid park",4.0
smelly utilitarian 1970s nightmare,let me preface this by saying that my husband and i are starwood fans platinum members for nearly a decade this westin however should have been renovated at least 10 years ago and wasnt  the result is that it literally stinks throughout in the lobby in the hallways in the rooms the smell is a combination of cigarette smoke still left in the air circulation system from when not all the rooms were smokefree old carpeting and simply a lot of people congregating in a place where there are no open windows anywhere ever i am sure an upgrade to the 1970s air circulation system could have helped the other relic are the elevators  they are so poorly coordinated that you inevitably get squeezed in like sardines with 20 other guests in a tiny again unventilated space going up 40 floors the lobby is generic bland and resembles an airport waiting area the roomsbathrooms should just be gutted and refurbished i do not recommend this place,2.0
great hotel  lives up to the westin name,"overall this is a good example of a westin property with nice public areas excellent service and clean  spacious guest rooms i stayed here on business this past week and will be back with my wife for a weekend trip very soon
pros
 very friendly staff
 elegant public areas
 excellent location  surrounded by shopping and places to eat
 overlooking union square
 very safe area to walk around and feel comfortable if you are a firsttime visitor
 nice rooms with large lcd tvs
cons
 not a family hotel per say ie more designed for adult travellers
 parking is pricey 50day
 no daily newspaper i found this a bit unusual
 wired highspeed internet  available 8 for 2 hrs 15 for 24hrs
helpful tips
 starbucks is 12 blocks away 
 streetcars go by right outside the front door
 2 large movie theaters within 5 min walk
tip on visiting san francisco
if you are a first time san francisco visitor and want to do some exploring i would recommend weather permitting jumping in a cab to pier 39 pier 39 has food shopping  incredible views of alcatraz golden gate bridge sea lions  this is a touristy area and you arrange additional tours at this spot at your leisure",4.0

great price great neighborhood,stayed at the whitehall second week in june several conventions were in town and most hotels had raised room rates to full fare  so the whitehall at 169 a night was a find i try to stay away from large corporate style hotels when possible since i find the service and personal touch of smaller hotels more friendly and personal the whitehall did not disappoint on any measure room was plenty spacious and clean staff was very friendly and accomodating quirky holdovers from days past include the small elevators and small hallways no ice machines but they delivered a bucket on request within a few minutes grocery stores restaurants and transportation all within a short walk decent fitness center and complimentary morning coffeetea made for an altogether excellent stay give me a whitehall over a hilton any day,4.0
horrible new years eve at the westin,"i booked the westin on the river walk for my husbands 60th birthday celebration i requested a balcony room facing the river walk so that we could see the fireworks boy what an awful experirence we had i realize new years eve is a busy busy time but when you are paying 35000 per night come on get your act together checkin is 300 pm we got there around 330 and we stood in line as they only had 3 ladies checking people in got to the counter and checked in but were told your room is not ready yet come back in an hour to get your room keysokay i guess so we walked on the river walk stopped and had a beer or two went back to the westin stood in line again got to the desk and was told your room is ready but you will need to wait to the side for us to get your luggage our one peice well 20 minutes go by im fuming and finally we ask the desk why we havent gotten our one bag yet oh its coming its at a another area no luck 15 minutes later my husband just goes behind the desk and looks in the holding room and there it is they never offered us or anyone else that was having the same problems a drink in the bar or to bring the luggage to our room when it was locatedoh nooooooo they would not even look at us
we get to the room its okay nothing special clean but certainly not worth 35000 the balcony door does not open and we are told for safety reasons none of them do jeez what a joke that whole experience was the only ones providing good customer service were the valet guys 
my husband travels for his job and has stayed at the westin in dhaka bangladesh and was treated like a kingin bangladesh but not san antonio texas",2.0
location and staff good not be better,"from the moment we pulled up we were pleased with what we saw great shopping right up the street the staff was very welcoming 
 hazel checked us in and was very pleasant when we got to our room i was a little surprised by what i saw we didnt have a full length mirror and i couldnt find a plug in the bathroom on our way out i asked hazel her thoughts on a place we were headed and then mentioned my bewilderment on the lack of mirror and plug she immediately gave us a new room  and a much nicer one

northern columbus,excellent size rooms clean front desk person was very friendly and wanted to help but he was very new to the job and had some issued with the check out process not his fault he needed a bit more training hotel is fine just too close to the interstate so there was noise leakage into the room as we were at the very front of the complex,3.0
nice rooms and nice area,the rooms and hotel were very nice they have a nice pool area with fire pits that are on at night the staff are very friendly the restuarant has a nice menu for dining in the hotel and there is shopping within walking distance you can also catch the trolley across the street from the hotel which will take you to some sight seeing spots,4.0
really really nice,stayed here in october 2011 for a few days the standard of the hotel is really good nice and clean and i saw the cleaners working everyday definitely a place to stay especially as there is a place to cook but would have been nice if they have a restaurant too the only problem is there is not much to do around there so good for business people but not a tourists delight,4.0
not that great,"when i first got there they put me in a tiny room so small that if you opened the fridge door or tried to sit at the desk you would hit the front of the bed i got bumped up to a bigger room which was much better
the area around the hotel is scary if i was a women traveling alone i would think twice about going outside after dark the hotel is surrounded by broken down parking lots  very ghetto 
furniture is old  and the bed was very lumpy",3.0
great stay,this was our second stay and it was wonderful we were very graciously upgraded to a beautiful suite which really made this stay special every staff member we encountered was warm and friendly i got into a conversation with a staff member while we were on the elevator and i asked him how long hed been working at the barclay he has been there 13 years which says so much to me about the management  it must be a great place to work and that is reflected in the pride their staff takes in the facility and providing a great experience for guests we had drinks in the bar and breakfast one morning the service and food are good and the atmosphere is lovely its a great location and an easy walk to many attractions including the un building we plan to return,5.0
everything we needed for a comfortable stay,the staff was very friendly and professional and the rooms were very clean though seemingly outdated the suites are spacious and well equipped complimentary breakfast was good and during the week they have complimentary dinner as well we were pleased to have fresh towels placed and our beds made while we were out and about during the day the service seemed to be a bit slow as we requested a few things that took quite awhile to be fulfilled while the hotel itself was quiet the nearby airplanes coming and going were quite loud and could be heard into the night overall a good experience and comfortable for our family of 6,4.0
home away from home,i love the eliot hotel it is refined yet cozy and not over the top there is a subtle elegance to the space the staff is friendly prompt and discreet a personal requirement the location is prime close to restaurants and shops i do not like boston but i am very pleased to have the eliot when i am there,4.0
plan on spending lots of extra money,obviously this is a luxury hotel from the first impression to the last thats what youll see the rooms are large and nicely decorated one of the best hotel bathrooms ever however it comes with a priceparking is an extra 20 add another 13 for the exercise room oh and internet is another 13 we spent an extra 200 on incidentals for a four night stay which was about double what i expected,3.0
best of the hotels at lax,"arrived at the hotel on 21st september after a late flight from london shuttle bus arrived after about five minutes and we were greeted by a very effusive driver who welcomed us to la five minutes later we arrived at the hotel and all the check in desks were quickly opened so check in was very swift got an upgrade to a corner room on my starwood gold card breakfast included in my rate was excellent with a good choice of fruit fried breakfast etc check out was also very efficient 
having stayed at lax several times this is without doubt the best of the airport hotels combine a great rate for the room including two breakfasts 129 booked direct with sheraton on the web and you cannot go wrong
everything above expectation so definately will return on the next la trip",5.0
great hospitality and value,the staff really goes the extra mile here the breakfast buffet is generous the location is good if you want to be near hollywood blvd and the parking is inexpensive and convenient the common areas have a lot of oldhollywood charm although the back area and our suite could use some remodeling the bedroom was up to date and cushy though and we really appreciated the touches you usually expect from more standard hotels like bathrobes local magazines la times coffee maker overall pleasantly quirky with a historical feel,4.0
great location but very tired,"the millenium un plaza is an excellent location where you are able to walk to grand central station in about 5 minutes we were amazed that 5th avenue times square etc are actually walkable in 1520 minutes 
the main mistake we made was staying for 7 nights after spending 4 nights at caesars palace las vegas the hotel simple did not compare and therefore maybe we were more critical than we usually would be
the hotel was chosen because its a 4 star hotel in a good location that was cheaper than most other hotels even the travelodge by times sq was 100 when we arrived the reception and lobby was nice enough but as mentioned it is very much a high class 80s style the receptionist was quite abrupt and mechanical without the usual high customer service shown by the rest of the city however the bell boys etc were very helpful and polite
when we arrived at the room on the 37th floor we were surprised to open a worn out motel like grubby brown door to be honest as mentioned the rooms are in need of modernisation and a bit of clean to the walls the shower although reasonably warm and quite powerful was like one from the 60s 
although in general this probably sounds quite negative the hotel was decent enough for the price paid and for new york we were out of the hotel most days at 9am and went to bed 2am plus most nights spending about 2 hours chilling and getting ready everyday therefore we didnt spend loads of time in the hotel because there is so much to see and do we didnt eat in the hotel as its expensive and the delis cafes and pubs locally are fantastic and very reasonably priced
we did go for a swim once but the pool was again a little outdated and need of a clean and not a big as the pictures show it to be to be fair though there were notices highlighting that the hotel going to be renovating its health and fitness facilities 
overall the hotel was fine for us because of the price about 8090 a night and location but if you are on a city break looking for luxury you may be disappointed",3.0
good hotel but with problems,"for the most part this hotel is good its close to a metro station the neighborhood while not at all trendy seems safe and above all its close to downtown washington dc without the high price we paid 14900 a night which included breakfast the rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable now for the downsides the staff seemed overwhelmed one morning at breakfast the food was almost completely gone we had to wait nearly an hour while the cook caught up meanwhile the staff initially offered no apologies only blame on others im the only server here and i cant do everything i talked with the manager of the restaurant and she did apologize and took the cost of one of our breakfasts off the bill
the next evening we came back to our room at around midnight our key cards would not work my husband went down to the front desk and got new ones they did not work he went down to the front desk again and again no staff person came up to help us get inthey just kept give us new key cards finally the next time the security person came upthe verdict was that the door lock was broken and we could not get into our room until the next morning the one person that could fix the lock was not answering their phone that person did not have a supervisor that could be called and that was that we were offered another room for the night and the room charge for that night was taken off the bill 
housekeeping left dirty towels and the trash in our room on one occasion 
bottom line in light of the other reviews i think we just had a string of bad luck with this hotel but i cant recommend it to anyone else",2.0
a perfect choice in nyc,"this is truly a great hotel comfortable with clean and beautiful rooms
a great hot shower with lots of water pressure imagine they give you ten different types of pillow choices concierge was helpful the room was very large considering what we paid i wont stay anywhere else",5.0
good place to stay,"the location was great in that it was close to downtown as well as the airport we stayed here before we flew out and it was a quick drive in the morning 
the place was well maintained and very nice looking the staff was helpful based on the sunburns the kids enjoyed the pool for a decent amount of time i liked the lobby and a variety of things for guests to do there i always like it when hotels make that extra effort
the rooms had a dvd player and i think i was told that there were some dvds in the lobby frig etc
the breakfast had a good variety and was a good continental breakfast

loved the hilton,"stayed a week at the austin hilton downtown we had an executive king room on the 26th floor this gives you access to the executive lounge on the 25th floor
room was good nice bed nice bath only complaints were self parking was 16 a day lot was under hotel with key card access and internet was 11 a day when youre paying close to 250 a night would it really hurt them to include parking or internet
on the other hand there was free internet in the lounge on their computer the lounge also had free continental breakfast afternoon snacks and late night snacks and free nonalcoholic drinks all day long and they had a concierge available and a few other things such as umbrellas in rained one morning and my meeting was a block away
everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful late night weekends they had security in the lobby to keep the kids from sharing their rooms you had to be able to prove you were a guest to get to the elevators
the pool was great it was a salt water pool with a hot tub many lounge chairs and a tiki bar all of this is on one of the building roofs
overall a very good experience and i would highly recommend it",5.0
ok place but it has problems,"my wife and i stayed at the adagio because of the price and the good reviews it was a clean place and the staff was friendly but our room did not have working internet my wife needed the internet to conduct business while we were away it was supposed to be included free in our room i told the staff about this problem and they worked on it right away unfortunately after 3 days it still wasnt fixed even though each day i was told that it was working we were then offered a different room but that room was very hot because the ac didnt work properly eventually they moved the ac unit from our old room to the new room and everything worked on our last night in the hotel
this hotel also has a restaurant but the prices are very high even for san francisco as an example they offer a cold buffet breakfast that includes 3 cereals a small offering of fruit yogurt and juices the price is 14 that is bad enough but then they add an additional 3 gratuity on top this is crazy i have never been charge a gratuity when i serve myself the total cost ends up to be after tax to be 20
overall the place was ok but i felt that it could have been better it is the typical city hotel that serves but seems to fall short of expectations",3.0
hotel harrington was the best deal weve found in a long time,we found our stay at the hotel harrington to be surpisingly pleasant and convenient while it was not the ritz it was extremely affordable close to everything and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful we were surprised to read some of the horrible reviews as the harrington is truly not that bad the rooms are average size it was clean and we certainly had working air conditioning you couldnt possibly ask for a better location the only thing we found humerous was the ridiculously shallow depth of the closet which we had no intention of using anyway people need to remember this is a very old hotel and is in the middle of a huge city you cant find a better deal we will absolutely stay at this hotel again gladly,4.0
staff make this hotel a good choice,"stayed at this doubletree hotel for one night while visiting detroit 
staff as mentioned in previous reviews the staff was great upon checkin the front desk staff came out to greet me gave me a rundown of the hotel features and showed me how to get to my room 
location very convenient to the southfield and i94 freeways numerous restaurants near the hotel there is a chilis and wendys within walking distance right across from the hotel parking lot it was only a 10 minute drive from dtw the hotel does not have a free shuttle 
room as a hhonors diamond member i was upgraded to a king bed suite the room was very nice and included a whirlpool tub all the furnishings and tvs were new along with the sweet dreams bed the only complaint about the room was that the ac was very noisy wireless internet access was very reliable and fast  it is free for diamond members it is quite a walk from the front desk to the room as you have to pass a massive lobby and meeting rooms just to get to the elevators however the hotel offers many entrances to get to your room you need to enter your key card in the elevator  a nice safety feature
food ordered room service for breakfast was prompt but for some reason it was cold could have been better the restaurant looked nice but did not get to visit it
atmosphere lobby was extremely spacious with small waterfall and many tables and couches however the hallways leading to the rooms were dark  there were not many people staying at the hotel probably because over a holiday weekend and thus it had sort of a cold  deserted feel to it
pool did not get to use it but it looked nice 
hhonors benefits as mentioned above did recieve free wireless internet for the stay along with a coupon for a free breakfast in the restaurant there is no exec lounge or exec floor on this property 
during my stay i received a call to make sure everything was ok with my stay upon checkout i received a personal email from the front desk manager thaking me for staying at the property and to email her if with comments i did not encounter one employee during my stay who didnt have a smile on their face
overall i thought this was a nice looking hotel with very comfortable rooms minus the noisy ac unit the friendly and professional staff really make this a great place to stay i would definitely stay here again while in the detroit area im hoping the hotel will consider adding shuttle service from dtw in the near future",4.0
best bang for the buck,i have stayed in many nyc hotel most which were more expensive yes the rooms were larger and the lobby more elegant but you dont stay in the lobby nor the room very long this was a newly renovated room which was very clean bed very comfortable  very clean bathroomthe only downfall was you had to pay for wifi and we couldnt controll the heat in the room a little too hot i would stay here again we only paid98 for a night best value i have ever paid,4.0
best hotel we have stayed at in new york,"we stayed at the belvedere and dream hotels in our previous stays to new york and the casablanca hotel far exceeded either of these hotels
the location was terrific  so close to the plays we did not hear any noise at all and had no trouble sleeping
the breakfast was great a very nice selection and very friendly service and a nice outdoor courtyard to eat in as well as a nice lounge with internet
the wine and cheese was a terrific compliment to a new york schedule after a day of sightseeing you can relax with a glass of wine and some cheese and fruit prior to going off to a play
10 out of 10 and we will definitely be back",5.0
lots of fun,"the hotel is well located to visit the farmers market and other attractionseg lacma
it has a slightly quirky image such as giant rubber ducks floating in the pool denim bedspreads and the naughty farmers daughter slogans this is all really well thought out and does a good job at distracting from this being a fairly basic motel
rooms were spacious bed comfortable shower hot staff friendly so all the key points covered off if you have expectations of a full service hotel then you will be disappointed
downsides aside from it being a bit basic the ac unit in our room was very noisy and the bed whilst clean and comfortable had quite badly worn sheets",4.0
excellent stay near the denver airport,we had an excellent one night stay near the denver airport the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast very good and rooms and beds were comfy we used the shuttle to get to the hotel and to pick up our car rental the next morning we would stay there again if at the denver airport,5.0
it is what it is,a budget stay in a great neighbourhood the rooms are clean and functional nothing is fancy and we were leary at first but hey it turned out fine at 14 of the price of other hotels researched we werent expecting 5 star and it it exceeded my expectations it was clean quiet and for the few hours that we spent there the rooms were okay two blocks to zabars and the subway close to many fine restaurants central park trader joes  what more could we ask for,3.0
great hotel,had been recommended the magic castle by a friend and was glad to see good reviews here had a great stay there for two nights the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was very clean and tidy  loved the turndown service newspaper in the morning and the breakfast was great the chocolate and cherry scones are worth getting up early for got a pretty reasonable rate from expedia and i think the price for the room and location was excellent provided a lovely start to our trip,5.0
great place to stay,we stayed here a couple of months ago we were very pleased my husband had business in dc and i came along to do some sight seeing we loved the happy hour wine hour every night and we enjoyed seeing people bring their dogs apparently dogs are very welcome in the hotel nice touch they have water bowls out for them while my husband was at his meetings i had no trouble at all walking to the very close subway station and navigating to all of the sites its a good idea to get a week pass for the subway if you are going to be there a few days ask the desk they were all very very helpful to me the room was great and so was the breakfast cant ask for much more,5.0
not the safest hotel,i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights the reason i would never stay here again was that while we were out they delivered some champagne and strawberries for our anniversary and left our room door open this was very upsetting to us considering that we returned to our room at 3am when we complained they did not seem to care if a hotel cant offer a safe place to stay then what are they actually offering you,3.0
great hotel,my wife and i stayed here after taking in the iu football game in bloomingtonwere from chicago and didnt feel like driving back up that night property is definitely newer right off 465 nice lobby tons of parking fountain at the main entrance was a nice touch too staff was very friendly room was good sized flat screen tv had a king and mattress and comforterpillows were excellent fridge in room too along with microwave got to the pool and it was heated hot tub was great suburban hotel so pool was nice sized as was the adjacent gymall super clean precor equipment in the gym so definitely nice didnt try the bar but did do room service fast person was friendly and food was reasonably priced,4.0
perfect choice great location,"i have just returned from a 5nt stay in the fairfield inn  suites manhattan chelsea and cant rate it highly enough
the hotel is very small and friendly in comparison to other large hotels in the city the hotel is very clean modern and quiet it is classed as part of the flower district and upon arrival you can see why
we had a slight problem upon check in with the room type bookedit was my sisters 30th birthday however the manager sorted this out for us quickly efficiently and without a problem the room was fairly small but was clean and we were more than happy with it breakfast was complimentary and was plentiful with a selection of bagels muffins cereals eggs yoghurts fresh fruit etc starbucks coffee and an array of teas and hot chocolate was available all day every day
the hotel was 56 blocks up from macys they say 1 block is approx 1 min walk so not far at all and was also very close to the empire state building and times square the hotels location was so good in fact you could pretty much walk anywhere we even walked from the american history museum down by central park back to the hotel one dayit took a few stops on the way but was certainly doable
the staff were amazing extremely helpful and knowledgable in fact the only negative i could rate from my whole stay was the fact that there were no safety deposit boxes availablethey were all being used so could prob benefit from a few more of these for guests ease of mind
overall a perfect stay id definitely recommend it to anyone and i wouldnt hesitate to stay there againthank you",4.0
excellent service and great hotel,my wife and i stayed here for a minihoneymoon after we got married last weekend we are from chicago but decided to stay local and were glad we did we got the room as a special and were upgraded as well which made it nice we stayed in a room on the 25th floor that had one bedroom and a separate room that with a fireplace that led to the balcony chances are if youre looking at this place youve done enough research so just go already service is great its no tipping so even if you try to tip they wont take it food is excellent and ria is the same kitchen as balsan so quality in both we had brunch there on a sunday and the consistecny or service was the same    great brunch is two courses one is a series of mini breads scones and muffin tops with different spread and dips the other is your choice of a series of entrees we went for a run one morning and were told to enjoy our run then when we got back we were asked how was our run and then when inside the lobby we were greeted by a nice young lady who said she hoped we enjoyed our run and handed us each a bottle of ice cold water seriously just go and enjoy,5.0
3 fantastic christmas holidays at the marquis,fantastic views over manhattan especially on higher levels also great view of times square itself facing northsouth very comfortable beds slimline tv and teacoffee machine very important if you want a drink just after waking or before sleeping if you decide to eat breakfast in the hotel you need to make your way as quickly as possible to restaurant as queues can be quite long,5.0
amazing customer service and perfect location,first time staying here and it was a wonderful experience helen at the front desk checked us in and was wonderful throughout our stay thank you helen for helping us and making our stay extremely pleasant got this hotel via expedias special rate where you find out the hotel after and we totally lucked out with this gem the room was very nice and the bathroom was amazing especially the shower pillows were heavenly suffice to say i loved it here,5.0

great staff quaint residential neighborhood,"the staff at the burnsley could not be more accommodating the hotel is in a nice residential neighborhood in the old capital hill area near the molly brown house museum but the free shuttle service to downtown locations makes it a convenient choice for a value hotel the rooms are very large with new beds and a fully equipped kitchen the room i was in had certain elements refurbished kitchen floor table freshly painted walls and other elements in need of renewal bathroom carpeting headboard 
for the rate we paid through aaa this hotel was a great value",3.0
mixed feelings about ny palace  needs to work on staff attitude,"the new york palace
i stayed at the ny palace with my sister and parents for 6 nights in june 2010 while the hotel offers a good location and spacious comfortable rooms many among the staff there do their best to ruin the experience
to list a few of the problems we have encountered
 on our first day i spoke to the concierge about booking a restaurant and thought they were extremely polite and i was very pleased little did i know that while he was being polite to me on the phone he was making fun of my name to his colleagues at the concierge desk and the person from the restaurant while making the booking all this was witnessed by my sister who happened to be downstairs waiting at the concierge about something else
i told this to the restaurant manager who a couple of days later asked us about our stay and to their credit he passed on the message to the concierge manager who then sent me a hand written apology note with champagne and strawberries also to my parents who were upset about the restaurant this was a nice touch and at least an effort towards damage control
 my name and surname were switched by mistake during the booking we tried to tell the hotel this from the first day however as they neglected to correct the mistake we had many problems
  we had forgotten some stuff in east hampton where we stayed before arriving at nyc our host there was going to send them to us by mail i gave him the hotel number and details he called to confirm the address and was told by the receptionist that our reservation was cancelled 
  he sent the package when i assured him that we were in fact still staying the ny palace just to make sure i called the reception and package deliveries and told them we would be expecting a package trying to ensure that they knew what name to look out for and didnt mess up as you can imagine we had to ask after the package for a few days constantly being told that it had not arrived the hotel finally gave us our package it on thursday after my contacting the cargo company and getting the tracking number it had arrived on tuesday morning on my name
 the service at the istana restaurant where we went for breakfast was terrible and only after many complaints a few of the waiters started paying special attention to us before that they were inattentive bordering on rude we regretted our breakfast being included in the price
the ny palace is a hotel that holds potential but they need to work on the service and staff behaviour it seemed to us that the only people who smiled at guests were the housekeeping staff everyone else had an arrogant and indifferent attitude",3.0
very friendly and helpful hotel,"my husband and i both have restricted height and hae just retuned from a weeks stay at the doubletree 
we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful from the first greeting we received from the doorman through to the reception staff and maid
we had a wheelchair access room which meant that the wardrope and towels rails were lower than normal which was great for us 
when we actually met the maid and she saw how short we are she was happy yo leave the clean towels on the lower rails for us the towels are very soft and fluffy the maid was also happy to leave us extra tea bags instead of coffee you know how much the english like their tea
internet access is free to guests so we were able to keep in touch with family and friends
the only negative point is the mini bar in the room drinks in the fridge  snacks placed on top of the frige are all on pressure pads so ou only have to touch or move any item and it is registered so be careful i picked up a small pack of pringles and had to remember to tell the reception staff that i didnt eat them they were fine about it and we were not charged for them
there is a great place to ave breakfast just up the road from the hotel called panera where they do a great latte if like us you dont like american coffee",5.0
charming hotel close to museums and great shopping,we just spent a weekend at the serrano taking in the steins collect and other coordinated exhibits at the contemporary jewish and deyoung museums the hotel is an easy walk to downtown museums yerba buena park the powell street cable car and all the shops of union square rooms are elegant and light filled the executive suite with jacuzzi tub was great and the staff was very helpful the new beer pub in the hotel has imaginative tastes and traditional pub fare we enjoyed both the food and the surroundings,5.0
great hotel,"room was very spacious good for all our baggage very clean the staff bent over backwards to make sure our stay was pleasant food was good room was very quiet and in an excellent location hotel was also very good value for money
would not hesitate to recomemend",5.0
basic facilities my experience was not brilliant,i checked in on 3rd dec 2010 it was a cold december evening heating in the room did not work i spoke to reception who said someone would be there in 10 minutes no one ever did,3.0
really cool vibe at this hotel,this place is very nice the staff all the way from the valet attendant to the front desk to the bellhop to the room service attendanttop notch helpful and friendly the room was a bit small for my taste and the bathroom had limited privacy my room had this pacific island theme and there was a window with shutters that separated the living area from the bathroomweird but it was kinda cool the heavenly beds were very comfy and the view was great looking out across lake michigan id have to say the only downside to this hotel is the fact that they were in the middle of renovations during my stay and we had to pardon the dusti understood hey they have to upgrade at some point right and the weirdest thing would have to be when we came back at about 2 am after the wedding we attended was over we pulled up and to find the lobby has been transformed into a nightclub i thought this was very interesting except for the fact that there was about 10 people laying down outside and they were clearly inebriated and ready to puke i mentioned to my brother that if we were just arriving for the first time right then i wouldve been very turned off that such a high class hotel turns into a pukefest nightclub dont get me wrong i think the whole nightclub thing in the lobby was cooljust not the puking guests laying all over the place outside the front entrance all in all this is a fantastic place to stay in a tremendous location just 4 blocks from the magnificent mile,5.0
uptown service with downtown delights,"i revisited the voort recently and had a very nice experience room was changed with no trouble when there was a problem doormen superfriendly as well 
just want to remind folks that both the highline and hudson river park are minutes away and you can cycle skate run walk the length of the island at your leisure i ran up hrp and cut in at 74th to central park and ran around the reservoir and back i had a cocoa on the highline for my cooldown really fun",4.0
hated it,this hotel has very poor air conditioning and i had to check out after one day however the manager is very rude and confrontational he was trying to force me to move to another room and started yelling at me when i told him i just wanted to leave there is no reception or waiting area and the hotel is completely locked down its very shady and the owner has a frightening attitude he hasnt refunded me the money after i checked out and were sorting it out with amex im shocked hes still in business,1.0
excellent value in a cracking location,"i stayed here for a week on a recent vacation  the entire package including flights was 700 approx 1000 so i reckon i mustve got a very good deal on the hotel
checkin was swift and i was given my choice of type of room  i took the king the room was on the 1st floor 2nd us and faced directly onto the railroad tracks so i was a little concerned on the noise front i neednt have been i only got woken once by the train in the entire week despite being a light sleeper just turned over and went back to sleep didnt even need to use the ear plugs provided
the location is excellent only 2 blocks from petco park and the trolley was even closer than that plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance which is nice if you fancy a drink but dont want to get behind the wheel afterwards
the room was well kitted out with the exception of a fridge wouldve been nice to have one but it isnt the end of the world nice desk area with ergo chair and a separate chair and footstool to sit on if you wanted a more relaxed stance bathroom was fine and i loved the crabtree  evelyn bath products provided
the gym was small but fairly well equipped with 2 treadmills a cross trainer and a reclined bike there were a couple of weights machines free weights mats etc too i used it every day and was perfectly happy with it the pool area was closed the first couple of days but opened again on memorial day weekend  the pool is quite small but clean the surrounding area has plenty of loungers and a nice decked area
staff were lovely especially the cleaning crew who always left my room looking immaculate ill definitely recommend this hotel",5.0
really nice hotel great lcoation near convention center,juts spent six nights at the embassy suites and it was a really nice visit the breakfast bar in the morning helps fuel you for the day and at the same time lets those of us with a daily allowance spend our stipend on the many amazing dinners around town osteria marco and rioja are two great spots i do have to say that the staff was a bit underwhelming the first night there i found a couple of hairs in the showeryuck made me wonder how well the rest of the room had been cleaned however after a quick inspection i was satisfied it was probably just an oversight by a busy housekeeper with a lot on her mind that day i was also a bit disappointed in the staffs knowledge of the city i had directions to get the bus to boulder by going to the market st station which i decided to confirm before heading out i was told to go to union station instead however once i arrived there the bus driver informed me that market st was the right place and i arrived back at the correct station just in time to see my bus leavefrustrating indeed the last interaction i had involved a request for a place with good dessert three people couldnt offer a suggestion which i found amazing even if you dont like dessert or are new to the area i would expect that a desk staff would have at least one suggestion for dessert even by just reading tripadvisor reviews oteria and rioja both had fabulous desserts by the way on the other hand a really nice bar person hooked me up with cocktail napkins and little cereal bowls to help me with the reception we had in our room for some fellow conference goers and the rooms are super spacious so all in all it was a good experience,4.0
amazing staff but hilton what happened,"ok i start by saying i feel sort of bad that i have not been able to write better reviews for hilton properties lately it is where i stay the most because i have a multitude of points and of course kimpton is not in every cityyet but hilton what has happened you seem to be cheeping out lately i wont review my other reviews but check them out as for this property let me start with the amazing staff they were great from checkin by name greeting free bottled water free bar drink coupon to the late checkout that they didnt even blink over when i requested dinner at the restaurant was excellent and again the staff there was so friendly and professional i would absolutely rate this property 5 stars based on the staff
however i have to rate the room since that is really what we all pay for
bed  comfortable
bath amenities soap shampoo etc  good
tv  probably good when it was new in1987 maybe seriouslytube tvs come on hilton spring for the flat screen but even that and its loud buzzing was not enough to lower the rating more than half a star then came the morning shower i thought maybe i didnt turn it up enough but oh noit was full power the trickle was so bad that i had to move all the way to the wall and be completely under the spout to get fully wet very frustrating
i am also frustrated because i really wanted to rate this experience high for my most visited brand but it just aint happenin",3.0
comfy bed great staff and nice bathroom,booked this hotel through priceline 113night for a late spring weekend to see a concert and visit with friends the bed was extremely comfortable the room was well outfitted althrough a bizarre window of sliding panels separated the bedroom and bathroom lobby and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful on the harbor side of the hotel there is a great patio area for sitting to enjoy a coffee or cocktail the pool in the spa is nice if a little on the small side for swimming laps this part of the financial district is a little dead on the weekends so aside from the restaurants in the hotel a walk or t ride is necessary to grab a drink or bite to eat all in all a great stay and would be thrilled to come back,5.0
good value with a great location,"clean comforatble rooms with great crisp fresh linen
easy to use alarm clocks and tons of useable outlets for charging

great for christmas,i love this hotel so much at christmas time the place is magic a true new york experience ideally located on time square every time i think of new york i remember the christmas i had at this hotel,4.0
beautiful historic hotel in a great location,"this is a gorgeous hotel that actually has quite a bit of history tied to it they have displays in the lobby showing the history of the earthquake in the early 1900s along with pictures and memorabilia they also have photos of famous people that have stayed there  a hotel channel that tells the history and famous people and the scandals they were mixed up in as a guest 
the clock bar is very cozy go early to get a seat after dinner it gets packed the bartenders are great they had a diverse drink menu and eccentric crowd 
we stayed in a deluxe tower room with king bed on the 19th floor the front desk staff was very friendly and when i told them it was our first time in sf they made sure we were assigned to a room with a great view we could see all the way to the water even though we were in the heart of union square we had a corner room with the bay window shown on the website as well as a side window the room was just like the picture it was huge with a large lshaped hallway that led to the bedtoom i dont know why they dont show the bathroom online its marble with a tub big enough to soak in and the normal westin heavenly shower we had a flat panel tv with plenty of channels i really liked all the dark wood and beautiful crystal chandeliers in the lobby its very elegant we found a great special online three nights for the price of two otherwise it would have been close to 350 per nt for the room we chose if i could get a similar deal wed definitely stay there again otherwise it would be a bit pricey and wed probably get a basic room there instead
if you are taking one of the hop on hop off bus tours they pick up right across the street very convenient",5.0
great location poor value,stayed for two nights whilst attending a conference at the hotel clearly geared towards large conferences even the lifts were trying to sell me litigation software the location is perfect for getting to central park the shopping around fifthmadison av times square and broadway  theyre all a ten minute walk away gym was surprisingly big and well equipped though pretty busy beyond that though it all goes a bit downhill maybe i expected too much from a giant conference venue in nyc aircon and lifts very noisy room so small there wasnt space for a cabinet on both sides of the bed breakfast service was appalling though the food was ok as a base for exploring new york it would work quite well but if youre planning on staying in your hotel why would you do that in ny then try the w on times square,3.0
perfect location for me,"this hotel is right next door to my daughters apartment building so it was ideal for me room was very nice clean and reasonably large with a great hudson river view although i didnt have much interaction with staff those that i did encounter were very helpful and pleasant 
its in the battery park city area so a bit removed from midtown and a lot that is the city but its proximity to 911 memorial battery park financial district ferry etc is excellent and all are but a few minutes walk shopping at hermes boutique on broad street is always a treat and a visit to the palm restaurant in tribeca is a must its within walking distance of hotel but area construction does make it a bit tricky especially if you dont know your way around at night its pretty quiet but that makes for a good nights sleep so you are ready for the excitement the next day will bring as ny hotels go price was quite reasonable i highly recommend",5.0
good for business,"i found the hotel very comfortable and ideal as a venue for meetings and for access to other parts of the city
the room was very spacious with a view over the harbour
the price was reasonable considering the location and convenience",4.0
great location,"we think this place is good value for moneypleasant  helpful staff and good location the area looked a bit rough when we arrived but having walked into town  and back  at night turned out to be safe
the room was fantasticclean  comfy bed  coffee making machine  a safe  and many small extras the view was the hotel suitesbut we were not there for the view breakfast was loud  but very good with a key system to enterdont forget your room key
parking was extra from the hotel you can walk to the towerwe went early and there where no queuesas we left there was a long queue we got the mono rail to the waterfront market very cheap had lunch overlooking the bayreally great place to visit
stayed 3 nights and would recommend only draw back is the main road at the frontyou have to go to the lights to cross and there is no road crossing for cars
we had a problem with the plumbing and the service engender was there in minutes",5.0
excellent in every catagory,i booked three nights here during a trade show because it was 100 per night less expensive than the hyatt who was hosting the show i was pleasantly surprised to find out how much value i got at the conrad great location to some awesome restaurants sweet room and some of the friendliest staff that i have met in all of my travels great job conrad,5.0
fantastic hotel,washington hilton is perfect for anyone visiting washington for the first time the hotel is in a fantastic location with restuarants roundabout for breakfast and meals the hotel itself is fantastic especially the beds and pillows we would love to know the make of the beds and pillows which are in the hotel as we did not have one bad night sleep or wake up with any pains after all the walking that we were doing between sightseeing and also on the day of the earthquake we had to walk from union station to the hotel the hotel should be compliemented on all their services which they provide especially the cleanliness of all the areas within the hotel tour bus tickets can be bought in the hotel and stops right outside the hotel which is even better we would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting washington and the metro is not to far away for anyone not wanting the tour bus but this is a perfect way to see washington,5.0
we had a great stay,the room was very nice we had a king size bedthe room was roomy enough for my husband and i to stay in we enjoyed the view of chicago outside our windows beautiful the bathroom was very nice they had a seperate glass see through shower and a very deep bath to soak in after a day of touring  anything we needed assistance with the help at sutton were right on top of it there was hardly a wait i would recommend this place to others for sure this was my first time going to a bigger city and staying over night and i have to say i was very nervous and looked online along time after finding the sutton place on a discount site i booked it right away there are sit down resturaunts right across the street for all times of the day and that would meet any price ranges even subway  walk out and you can start your shopping experience there are so many shops and the magnificent mile is just a block away navy pier was a good time and shedd aquarium take a taxi everywhere if possible you will more than likely save money rather than taking your car everywhere parking prices are rediculous in chicago the only thing i wasnt happy with is i feel the 55 a night to keep our car at the sutton place was rediculous i could see maybe 20 or better yet include it as something you give to your guests free of charge because they chose your hotel we also were happy that when we arrived in chicago we were able to check in at 12 or 1 so earlier than the check in time and then we were able to go on with our day so that was nice all in all we had a very nice stay and yes i will be going back,4.0
home away from home,we stayed 5 nights at the towneplace suites while having some remodeling done at our house it was very comfortable for us with a well appointed kitchenette cozy seating area good bed and desk while the walls were a bit thin everything else was to our liking and our time there was quite enjoyable since i dont have a laptop i especially appreciated the computer with internet access in the lobby area where i could check my emails each morning the fitness center is small but all the machines were in working order and it was very clean i recommend towneplace for anyone traveling to denver its great for an extended stay,4.0
loved the holiday inn manhattan 6th ave,this was our first time going to new york city and we absolutely loved it the hotel room was small but cozy it felt like we were at home the bed was the best ive slept on while being on vacation the staff was so helpful and the location was great when i return to new york ill definitely stay at this hotel again without a doubt the tshirts are right when they sayi love new york,5.0
room was moldy,"room smelled like moldyou could see mold in the tubwhen i checked in on saturday agent failed to tell me the following day there would be a festival that would on shut down all street including the one in front of the hotel making it impossible to get a taxi to anywhere
the deorative pillows on the bed were so filthy i have to put them on the floor i would never stay here again even for half the price",1.0
great hotel and service,my family and i stayed here in december 2011 during our visit to phoenix the hotel was clean and the personal was nice the beds were comfortable the bathroom and shower were clean furthermore the price was excellent for a hotel so close to downtown,4.0
small but hip,the pod hotel was a great place to stay in nyc the hotel is stylish and hip it is located in midtown and is just two blocks from the lexington avenue  53rd street subway station the rooms or pods are small but they are sufficient everything is clean and well maintained not all of the rooms have their own bathrooms however mine did i found the bathroom to be odd the shower stall was enclosed in clear glass meaning that whenever anyone showers all can be seen keep in mind that the shower is in the room on one side not in an enclosed room the staff was nice and helpful this is the perfect place if you want to get close to your lover,4.0
sweet place but make sure you get the right room for you,"the inn is made up of several houses and i dont think there are lifts in any of themthere seems to be a huge difference in the size of the rooms in the different buildings two colleagues of mine were in rooms in the main buildings right on ferry street and they were absolutely enormous with stunning bathrooms my room was in one of the two carriage houses set behind the main ones and it was much smaller i remember the shower in the bathroom being really quite small however once id got over my jealousy i reasoned that my room was warm and extremely comfortable for breakfast you have to walk over to the main house  but there is a wide range of good food
the inn is ideally placed for the museum district and there are a couple of shops and restaurants nearby but to go downtown you need a car or to arrange something with the hotels shuttle service i think the wifi only works in the main house  or at least i couldnt get it to work in the carriage house i was grateful for the computer room uptairs from the reception",4.0
nice place to stay,very clean room excellent service everyone was very nice and helpful room had great plugins in the lamps on nightstands also an ihome dock which was great nice frig and microwave large comfortable sofa bed was a bit hard bedding very clean if looking for hair dryer it is in the closet not attached to wall in bathroom wonderful complimentary breakfast with lots to eat check out is nice and late if needed  1200 hotel was very kind to hold our luggage after checkout so we could go down to the waterfront and not have to worry about our car getting broken into there is no room service dvd or payperview tv room was quiet dont know if the nearby rooms were empty or if walls were soundproof,4.0
luxury at its finest,"if you have ever wondered what true luxury is but you havent been able to experience it that is because perhaps you have never been to this majestic landmark nestled in the center of our nations capital
from arrival to departure everything about this hotel is absolutely flawless the staff is the most courteous and genuine always going out of their way to help and ensure you feel at home singling anyone out would be unfair to the rest of the team especially those behind the scenes that dont have the opportunity to interact with you and make you feel special through simple acts of kindness such as remembering your name and addressing you by name and a warm smile every time they see you
the hotel itself is beautifully adorned italian renaissance design with all the modern amenities expected in a luxury hotel the location is superb as you can walk everywhere and the white house is a block from the hotel from there you are minutes to monuments culture museums restaurants shopping and a beautiful city 
a visit to the st regis and washington dc is not complete if you do not treat yourself to the best dinner of your life at the hotels restaurant adour where you will be immersed in the culinary delights of alain ducasse the food nirvana the setting gorgeous eclectic and seductive the service unparalleled
do yourself a favor and go nowyou can thank me later",5.0
great location  not so good place,"the location is great but the place is not so good the room was dark and very old fashioned and during my 5 day stay the room was serviced daily but never properly cleaned there was dust everywhere which remained there throughout the stay so much dust that i woke up sneezing every morning
the lifts were a nightmare 3 times i had to use the stairs walked down 24 flights as they took 1015 mins to arrive there are 2 elevators and one seems to be used by the service guys most of the time so they lock this off twice the elevators broke and the fire brigade came out with no apologies from the staff
i asked the front desk to recommend a good thai restaurant but they said they didnt know of any yet in their inroom dining guide they have one listed i tried that one and it was the worse most unauthentic thai food id ever tried so dont use them
my coffee maker also didnt work and 3 times i could not get into my room as the card would not work again no apologies and it was almost an inconvenience to them when i complained",3.0
best place to stay in san antonio,as soon as we entered we were greeted by the staff who were all friendly and helpful the hotel was very modern and had comfy sofas and beds the location was great my friends and i walked to the alamo world genus museum the haunted house and also did the 3d tomb raider rider the food at the hotel was amazing the best food item was the fried macaroni balls the pizza was really good tooooo we also had a birthday partygathering and had food catered to us the chef and the 4 course meal were amazing we had a soup salad and entree chicken or steak and dessert for a reasonable price the overall experience was amazing and i would definitely recommend the riverwalk plaza and hotel to everyone,5.0
great stay for 5 families,"we had booked 5 rooms and had several people coming in at different times the hotel was great at helping us be on the same floor although a little spread out on the same floor this was after several phone calls to ensure we would be on the same floor and hopefully even adjoining we did not get adjoining suites hence the 4 stars instead of the 5 the breakfast was great and the evening happy hour was pretty good too although in the evening it was a little light on snacks 
overall a great stay and we enjoyed our time in denver and this hotel",4.0
fantastic hotel,"stayed at this hotel for the weekend got an amazing rate through the marriott web site  despite the fact that every other decent hotel in dc was sold out the rooms are extremely well appointed and they accomodated all my special requests the staff was very friendly and helpful
my only complaints are that the hotel is very large and very busy the main ballroom is located on the entrance floor which creates excessive traffic in the lobby area every night also the room service prices are excessive youre better off grabbing a bite somewhere in town
overall i highly recommend this hotel",5.0
great location,"stayed at nine zero for a long weekend  great location  wonderful view from our 17th floor room a bit pricey but the bed was so comfortable the mini bar was full of expensive stuff  we asked if we could take a few things out to add our own cokes  milk  they said no problem
we walked to quincy marketplace the hotel is close to sam lagrassas  which was yummy",4.0
after staying at the w in times square the w in sputh beach this by far is the best maintained facility,nice hotel room was nice my only complaint is that ive noticed at all w hotels is the exhaust vent in the bathroom is filthy thats 3 w hotels in less than a month this seems to be the only one that keeps the rest of the property and room well maintained unlike my last 2 w hotel stays this is by far the best but why cant any of them seek to noticed a thick layer of dust on the exhaust vent pretty nasty if you ask me,5.0
great in every way,good and central for everything but check that your room does not face the train station as train go by through the night blasting their hooters,5.0
noisy dirty and poor service,"the location is the only good feature of this hotel the first night i didnt sleep because of noisy neighbors and this was a tuesday saturday night was apparently party night both in the hotel and the neighborhood i arranged to move rooms the morning after the first night and was later told it was not possible because they were fully booked they ran out of caffeinated coffee for the rooms on saturday and i was told it would be available on monday i normally choose best western accommodations because they are uniformly clean and adequate this room had dirty carpet heating and ac did not work the towel racks were not even hung on a level the people at the desk might as well have a sign on their forehead saying tell someone who cares 
i asked for and received permission to check out  1230 and i had people calling me and asking when i would be leaving",2.0
great experience very clean hotel  the staff was extremely friendly,loved our stay in the north end the hotel is only blocks from the train station and faneuil hall the room was very comfortable  clean and the staff was super friendly thanks for a great weekend in boston,5.0
terrific hotel,the best western island palms is a beautiful hotel that is centrally locatedminutes away from downtown the gaslamp district la jolla the airport and many other destinations the rooms were very clean and the view from the 3rd floor marina rooms was fantastic danny at the front desk was so helpful and upgraded our room everyone we dealt with from the hotel was fantastic and the food at the restaurant was very good we will stay here every time we go to san diego,5.0
great location,nice trendy hotel as expected for aloft fantastic location would certainly stay there again with the wifey not with the kids not a hotel designed for kidos lobby area is done nicely with a pool table and the pantry is very convenient,4.0
argonaut great for families,"what a great place particularly for families with young kids very good staff not fawning  just friendly cool and on the ball they sorted out babysitters and had a kids treasure box of free cheap toys 
very new hotel lots of space everywhere and although the nautical theme is taken a bit far its not distasteful actually quite fun 
the blue mermaid restaurant is pretty good great with kids nice and relaxed and good value why it shuts at 9pm was beyond us  go there early
lovely big suite for 479 a night  tax which we thought was good value compared to our horror experience at its sister hotel the triton modern very clean and spacious with a superb deep hottub bath and alcatraz framed in our bedroom window like a postcard 
the area is touristy but not crowded and we liked it as a base for a 3 day stay the cable car stop is just round the corner so off you go into the rest of the city and its very handy for the golden gate bridge alcatraz bike hire next door seafood restaurants and so on cabs are so cheap that you can get to union square for 9 so being out of the centre doesnt really matter and it has a nice laid back vibe down there 
the wine tasting was a bit of a joke  a choice of two cheap wines one of which was from australia but at least it filled up the spacious lounge with happy guests
one thing  dont make the mistake i made and call abroad from the rooms phone i had to change our rental car booking and a 10 minute call to an international freephone number cost 128 they halved it when i complained but even so
phone charges aside wed highly recommend the argonaut",5.0
great getaway,"we really enjoyed our recent stay at the arizona grand resort the accomodations were clean and spacious my kids found the room comfortable and enjoyed having a tv of their own to watch during the daytime the water park was both fun and relaxing i definitely would recommend the santa fe burger for lunch
we found the service to be friendly and personalized starting at checkin and throughout our stay we are looking forward to staying at the resort again",5.0
tired hotel,i just booked a group here and stayed myself as well the hotel staff for the most part made the stay enjoyable this hotel is old and tired and needs a major renovation as a travel professional i hold hotels to the highest standard my standard this hotel definitely did not make the cut the huge oversized lamp in my room was broke the shower had mold and the shower curtain seriously who uses shower curtains anymore at high end hotels for goodness sake if you are going to use them then get the bar that extends so when you are lathering up with soap the gross nasty curtain doesnt stick to your body plus the hooks were broken all but 3 of the 12 were in working order majorly ambarassing for a hotel that tries to act hip i would definitely recommend the gramercy park hotel but if your budget does not allow you to stay there then this will suffice the location of this starwood chain w hotel is the best thats what this hotel has going for it i would not rank it as a virtuoso hotel one bit thank god they have a great staff and even better location otherwise i would say skip it another big bonus is the green market in the square along with whole foods and traders joes all within walking distance be careful not to pay too high of a rate here otherwise you will be extremely disappointed,3.0
centrally located hotel,accomodations were clean and comfortable best feature was that the hotel is within walking distance 2 blocks of the smithsonian and national air and space museum one negative was the smithsonian restaurant in the hotel not at the museum the service was terrible parking is onsite and only 25day and easily accessible from the lobby elevators,4.0
great locationcleanbut overpriced,staff was very pleasant and helpful especially with explaining how the hopon hopoff trolley operates great locationjust blocks away definitely within walking distance from many eateries and places to shop also very close to the boston common i have no complaints with the staff or the hotel itself although its very odd that registration  concierge are on the 3rd floor and we had to use 2 separate elevators to get from street level to registration to our roommy only real complaint is the value i dont have a problem for paying a lot for a city hotel but for the price i feel each room should have a fridge and microwave and that the hotel should have snack  soda vending machines the gift shop is extremely overpriced especially for snacks and drinks we ended up walking to a nearby cvs to buy snacks and drinks to save money a souvenir shot glass in other gift shops was 5 but the same shot glass was 10 in this hotel the hotel was very clean and thats always a plus,4.0
amazing location  lovely staff,"we stayed at hotel edison for our honeymoon on aug 23rd for 4 nights i am a travel agent so was recommended to me by the operator at kuoni travel  who i booked through i am so glad i booked this hotel 
after our amazing flight being upgraded to business class it was so nice to also be greeted by lovely staff at this hotel the porters were stood outside to greet you and help you with your bags we got a taxi from the airport as it was quicker which cost about 50 check in was efficient and quick dont know if we were just pure lucky but we were allocated a room on 4th floor which was huge looks like we got the newly refurbished disabled room we had flat screen tv on the wall queen size bed the bathroom was a wet room also had a street view  facing the barrymore theatre theres a safe behind reception which you can use you are given a key for the duration of your stay theres a cafe attatched to it which serve lovely breakfast again they are quick and efficient also reasonably priced 
the best thing about the hotel is the location round the corner from broadwaytimes square where its all happening we walked every where in midtown because of the fab location greyline buses leave round the corner from the hotel too  which i recommend booking if you want to see the whole of new york lots of places to eat and drink theres a starbucks on the corner where you get free wifi dannys deli is next door but one which is open 24 hour my husband used to get some beers from there and take them back to our room 
we had a late flight home check out time was 12pm there is somewhere where you can store your cases  charge 1 per bag which is worth it so you can still explore nyc theres also a big lobby where you can wait to grab a taxi to the airport 
the only thing that may bother some people esp the light sleepers is that because of the location it can be noisy it didnt bother us because thats new york if it does ask for a high floor overall a brill stay at hotel edison would defo stay here again",4.0
this is the only place to stay in indianapolis,"this is the only place to stay in indianapolis very impressed its obvious the new owners worked very hard and are dedicated to making sure your stay is enjoyable i travel a lot and customer service is very important everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating rooms were clean and comfortable great restaurant location is perfect i wouldnt think of staying anywhere else thank you to the new owners for making us feel at home
on another note i was shocked to see a couple negative comments and can only assume those people didnt communicate with the staff or the owner directly cant fix it if you dont know its broke how many places can you contact the actual owner or speak to them personally you cant get that kind of service from big corporate chains  youd just get an 800 number to call communication is key
looking forward to staying there the next time were in town
thanks again",5.0
your needs will determine if this hotel is satisfactory for you,"we stayed in the comfort suites mission valley san diego ca for 5 nights in july 2006
it depends on your needs to determine if this hotel is satisfactory for you
the prior reviews were accurate but that does not necessarily mean you should not stay here
1parkingas opposed to other hotels in san diego parking here is free the spots surrounded the building there were quite a number of spots but still i wonder if one would get shut out if one arrived real late at night we got back late a few times did find a spot but we had to back in  as the spots were tight
if you are a good driver are adept at backing into a spot then you will be ok
so parking is free which is a positive
2the breakfast is typical choice hotel breakfast cereals bread danishes juices coffee and this hotel even had hard boiled eggs too
aside from the indoor breakfast room there was an outdoor eating area also we were earlybirds so we were able to get an outside table each morning
i dont know why anybody would knock the breakfast at this hotel it was fine
3location
this hotel was one of many hotels that were near each other
a reference to the aaa tour book spotting map will show that there are many hotels in the vicinity
i found the location of this hotel outstanding it is actually on the service road of one of the freeways
this hotel is centrally located as it is near 3 freeways concurrently
we went to 
wild animal park
sd zoo
seaworld
balboa park museums
sd airport
the wild animal park is a bit of a ride north but the other places and airport are minutes from the hotel
in addition we were not real far from downtown and visited the
shops along the harbor
the entrance to the freeway was just a few blocks from the hotel what more could you ask for
4movie charge
i just reread one of the reviews before i wrote this and was incredulous that i had the same thing happen to me
the night before we left i channel surfed for a few minutes while my wife was packing the luggage
when i got the bill the next morning there was a charge for a movie i told the girl that i did not watch a movie i just channel surfed for a few minutes she asked if somebody else was in the room with me and i told her my wife was  but she never even touched the tv she eventually took the movie off the bill but it took a few minutes to get it straight and i had a plane to catch at sd airport i was not thrilled that i was even doubted
5the room itself decide for yourself
as mentioned in prior reviews this really was 1 room and a partial wall was installed to make 2 separate areas
you come into the room and the sleeping area is first
the air conditioner is in the next section not the section that you sleep in
to circulate the air they installed a fan in the wall separating the 2 areas the fan is by broan the range hood people and the sound is identical to the sound that your range hood fan makes
we spent each day we were in sd out all day long and did not return until dark entire days at wild animal park legoland sd zoo museums seaworld so we were pretty tired by the time we got back to the hotel showered and went to sleep
somehow that fan did not bother us and we slept well each night
so if you can handle a fan whirring over your bed it will not be an issue if you are a light sleeper you will have a problem
there was a desk to work on next to the ac so you froze while working at the desk
the cold air did not seem to come into the sleeping area fan and all still we were able to sleep
conclusion
you need to decide what is important in your life
i liked the great access to several freeways
i liked the breakfast  it was fine
i liked the free parking if you found a spot and know how to back in you will be fine
the place was secure as your plastic room key got you into the outside property doors as well
the hotel was reasonable priced
if you just need a place to have breakfast sleep and shower you will be ok with this hotel
downside
the room is claustrophobic as it is real crowded with that wall more a hindrance than a help
i was in an embassy suite and that is really a suite
this may say comfort suite but i do not agree this is not a suite simply a room with a wall that divides one room doing more harm than good
i called choice hotels and stated my displeasure with this setup and the girl told me many of the comfort suites are like this
i will make it my business to stay in a regular room next time
i will not turn my back on choice hotels as i have been happy in many other properties that i have stayed in
i once stayed in a clarion and it was magnificent and i once stayed in a sleep inn that was fabulous
you must really do some soul searching about this particular property to see if you can deal with a fan over your head while you are trying to sleep
the breakfast free parking easy access are all things that are right",3.0
great location great service,really enjoyed my brief stay the hotel was very centrally located the service was fantastic and the food was really good too nice change of pace from the standard hotel chains,5.0
the staff went the extra mile when i left clothes behind,thanks to billy in security i stayed at the hotel for a conference and accidentally left a jacket behind when i checked out i didnt notice till i was on my plane somewhere over kansas i called the hotel they put me in touch with billy and he shipped my jacket overnight just like that great service,4.0
decent marriott fine for a night by the airport,"we recently stayed at this hotel for just one night after arriving into phoenix on a late flight from the east coast the hotel isnt too far from the airport but it is probably three miles or so from it airport hotels in phoenix arent clustered right around the airport like they are in some other cities so be aware of this we had printed directions ahead of time but especially at night coming from the rental car center we wouldnt have known where to go otherwise 
the hotel is generally pretty nice weve stayed at better and worse marriotts in the past the hotel is perched right at the intersection of a couple highways so id recommend requesting a room away from the highway if youre worried about noise we were given a room on the side away from the highway and had a nice view facing scottsdale and camelback mountain 
the hotel itself is nice enough the lobby is nice and the grounds are well manicured with free parking the rooms are a decent size and ours was clean the room décor is a little outdated a sort of southwestern motif there have been updates made to the rooms such as the new marriott bedding it was the light fixtures furniture etc that looked outdated a full renovation of our room had not been completed and the same goes for the hallways 
otherwise we didnt really see anything remarkable about this hotel it served perfectly well for a quick night by the airport before moving on to the grand canyon i wouldnt stay here for a vacation 
in terms of things in the area around the hotel i dont think there was much within walking distance a couple minutes drive up the road will get you to some grocery stores target and chain restaurants the area generally looked safe but not fancy i think its a perfectly acceptable place to stay for a night near phx",3.0
standing up to the sofitel brand,have stayed in sofitel lafayette square twice will keep coming back for its perfect location in the proximity of landmarks in dc and the museum district their friendly service and delightful room service meals extraordinary breakfast selection is consistent with the high standard that sofitel offers rooms are spacious and well appointed with an extremely comfortable bed highly recommended,4.0
nice hotel in a great location but needs a little customer service training,we check in to this hotel after having a bad experience at another hotel a few blocks away the doormen were all very helpful and seemed very genuine we arrived around 8 am because we could not stay in the previous hotel any longer and the front desk got us checked in and to our rooms in just a few moments the room was also very comfortable and there was plenty or room for the four large pieces of luggage we brought there were a few small issues 1 i requested another blanket and called several times but never received the blanket the next morning i went to the front desk and let them know that i needed a blanket for that evening and it was taken care of 2 my rate included a daily coffee card subway card movie and mini bar credit i had to visit the desk three times to get this included value including the morning i check out to remove the mini bar charges 3 the afternoon before check out the next morning we called about weighing our luggage and were told not a problem just bring it down to the business center so at 530 pm we go down to the business center with four large bags wait inside the business center that appears to be closed until someone from the front desk finally comes over to ask if they can help she offers to find us some help in the meantime 545 pm the gentleman that actually works in the business center appears and says he is closing at 600 pm and does not have time to weigh our luggage that will take all of 30 seconds so we ask him to get us someone willing to help he sighs and gets the scale overall this hotel is really a good hotel that could be great with just a little customer service and pride from the staff,4.0
perfect accomodations,i am becoming a regular customer at the vagabond inn on hotel circle when i come to san diego the rooms are clean the beds are comfortable and the service is great there are restaurants close by but they offer fresh cooked waffles cold cereal juice and fresh fruit for breakfast a convenience store right next to the hotel microwave and fridge in each room and the freeway is just down the street the hot tub is like icing on the cake,4.0
great place to stay,we spent 11 nights at the ocean park inn and enjoyed every one of them yes there is construction going on in the hotel they are replacing balcony decks and railings and air conditioners and next door to it they are rebuilding the lifeguard tower we didnt find either project to be excessively noisy in fact many rooms were closed so the hotel was quieter than it might have been and the flow on the boardwalk was interrupted so it was quieter as well this hotel was somewhat removed from the party section of the beach which was great for our family we only had to walk out our the secure hotel gate and a few feet down the boardwalk to reach the stairs to the beach the room was very clean the bathroom somewhat dated but large and the beds were very comfortable the breakfast was great as well and they do now offer cream cheese with the bagels the building is of wood construction so there is some sound transference we could hear water running and loud discussions if they took place in the bathroom most of noise we heard was created by incredibly rude people who felt that having loud discussions in the hallway or letting their kids play soccer there was perfectly acceptable they rank right up there with the ones who bypassed the handy outdoor shower and went straight into the pool or their rooms sand and all the pool was nicely warm and cleaned regularly there are lots of restaruants nearby our favorites were taylors right next door and joes crab shack a few doors down it was easy to drive to the attractions we wanted to see sea world was about a 10 minute drive away our view was overlooking a very old motel however we could see the ocean and it was quiet our only issue with this hotel is that although it is a totally nonsmoking hotel they allow people to smoke on the balcony with the door closed as a result we were treated to flicked ashes and the smell of cigarettes on several occasions,4.0
surprisingly upscale,close to the convention center and next door to the more toney jw marriott this sister hotel was a surprise with a modern upscale design and  nicely appointed rooms my room wasnt a full suite bedroom with a door but perfectly fine for my purposes if you are there with the family an upgrade might be in order the staff were friendly and professional and the included continental breakfast was quite decent applebees is attached should you want something more substantial the hotel is well located only a short walk to the tourist action but in a quiet section of the downtown  it was definitely a pleasant surprise at an excellent rate,5.0
basic accomodations near downtown,stayed here in late january parking is indeed 10 which seems strange since we are not in the center of downtown room was nice clean and modern but nothing outstanding late checkout available for priority rewards members  but beware of the managers and housekeeping that will call your room and knock on the door every 15 minutes starting at noon ruined the extra sleep and relaxing we needed the shuttle service was excellent  now only if it ran later so we could actually have stayed out without paying for a cab or parking on top of hotel parking the staff at night was excellent because the shuttle was running a bit slow they took the initiative to call the restaurant we had reservations for to let them know we would be late above and beyond  very thoughtful there were loud teenagers from out of town that blew a foghorn at about 12 am and the staff was upstairs before we could inspect the hallway i would stay here again if the rate was significantly lower or if there were more amenitiesless fees,3.0
cant put into words how great this place is,my husband surprised me for our anniversary this past weekend by taking me to hotel zaza in houston he kept telling me that the hotel was a surprise i couldnt imagine a hotel being any better than the many thousands of hotels weve already stayed in i was a flight attendant for over 8 years and felt that if you stayed in one you stayed in them all boy was i surprised from the moment we pulled up to the hotel i could tell things we were different once we stepped into the lobby i noticed how upscale the atmosphere was surprisingly though the staff and service was very warm when i walked into our room thats entertainment concept suite my mouth dropped our room was gorgeous and i loved the theme the monarch restaurant was outstanding the chef came out and spoke to me because i requested to alter a dish he wanted to talk to me on how he could make my dish taste great with some other ideas on my request my husband and i were supposed to go out to a club later that night but we had such a good time at the restaurant we stayed there all night and partied we were treated like royalty our entire stay all the way to the last moment of our stay when a staff member opened my car door for me and gave me a bottle of water this hotel surpassed all other 4 star hotels ive ever stayed in we will come back for every anniversary for the rest of our lives cant wait till next year,5.0
historic magic,if you book a reservation with the driskill forget about popular chain hotel experiences its not flashy and shiny its more  its beautiful classy and magical this is a historical experience within a hotel setting nice artwork all through the hotel and hallways we booked the queenqueen with window because of the small room factor yes its small but it was clean cozy and quiet the beds are so comfortable so much so the middle rod supporting it popped out while we were asleep the sound woke us up we laughed thought about the ghost storiesrolled over and went back to sleep the bed was still comfortable 82yr old mom said i had the best sleep and she has a pillowtop at home our bathroom was large enough to accomodate a wheelchair if necessary had good lighting upscale natural products extra soft towels and they provided a makeup mirror in the bedroom if you needed it we could adjust the temp of the room we were in rm 909 facing out 7th street because we were traveling with my elderly mom and needed a quiet place the size of the room helped us out she didnt feel scared or intimidated when we left her for the concert that evening the staff was great very professional not snobbish they didnt make me feel out of place and i appreciate that as i was worried about this ive traveled in and out of country and that has been a sad issue at some hotels that think snobbishness  class we felt welcomed from the moment we got out of the car to go into the hotel i was happy to see people of all racesages enjoying themselves in the piano bar and lobbies for the holidaysthey had the largest christmas tree ive ever seen beautifully decorated 6th street is youthful too cool had to ignore only 1 persistent young panhandler felt it wouldnt be a safe idea to show financial compassion so many down i prayed instead music everywhere after partying i stayed up and read sitting on this wonderful highback chair state capitol few blocks over good mix of youth and history delicious bakery and coffee didnt want to leave and going back to stay for a few days for the holidays 2012 it has flavorcharacter and its deserves all 4 stars i booked through expedia got a good price,5.0
great location for staying in chicago,"we had a wonderful week in chicago the hilton chicago is full of rich history as you learn on the elevator monitors and is in the perfect location for experiencing the city and getting a great view of lake michigan
the only negative the ac worked very poorly in the parlor portion of our suite where the kids slept on a murphy bed in spite of several calls and attempts by engineering to remedy the situation otherwise the room was quite comfortable with respect to furnishings  bedding",4.0
beautiful rooms  friendly staff,recently stayed here as part of a business trip front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially sarah who helped get a room ready after i arrived from a long flight and needed to get ready before meetings rooms are very nice  clean modern and tastefully decorated and i appreciated the small touches like toothpaste location is superb to convention center shopping light rail and waterfront pool is beautiful and was quiet with only a few people there locker room is shared with spa and was also very nice and clean only complaint is that i had trouble connecting to the wifi in short great hotel  friendly staff would highly recommend,5.0
i will never stay here again,i found the staff very rude and the rooms very worn the place is a dump,1.0
brilliant hotel,"i stayed at the library hotel with my wife for our honeymoon 
the location is brilliant slap ban in te middle of manhattan and very close to 2 subway lines 
the breakfast was absolutely brilliant and the complimentary cheese and wine and olives crackers salad etc was a great touch 
the rooms were nice 
the service was excellent on the whole 
there is also free wifi throughout the hotel including in the rooms and a computer station with printer if needed as well 
only very slight problem is the lifts were a bit temperamental 
overal its the best hotel i have stayed in",5.0
perfect location to convention center,"stayed at hampton inn for a convention being held at the pennsylvania convention center the hotel was around the corner from the convention center entrance so it was an easy walk i drove and used the valet parking i didnt need my car until checkout so im not sure how easy it was to retrieve your car if you needed something in it the staff was very friendly and responsive despite the large number of guests we never had to wait for elevators or in the breakfast area the food selections at breakfast were good the room was a good size and the shower had great water pressure always ice in the ice machine we didnt get to use the pool or fitness room but we saw others who had used it i think the pool opened at 7am 
foodthere was a great little pizza shop one block over cheesesteaks pizzas beer and the sheraton had a small restaurantbarone block over in the other direction the reading terminal across from convention center was amazingmore food choices in one place than ive ever seen it closes at 6 pm but we went there for lunch each day 
 the hampton inn is in a perfect location for us and the value was great it is the city so there is alot of people milling around but we never felt unsafe i would definitely return there",5.0
i will definitely return to sutton place,this was my first stay at sutton place and i will definitely return the location is unbeatablethe service was exceptional and my room was outstanding in every way i will return to this hotel on future trips to chicago regardless of whether im travelling for business or fun first rate in every aspect,5.0
excellent service walking distance to restaurants shopping and gaslamp district,"we stayed at this hotel for the last 4 days of our trip the hotel was very clean quiet and well maintained the lobby is on the located on the 12th floor of the hotel which was nice upon entering the lobby we were greeted right away and told that we were able to check in even though check in wasnt for a couple of hours the lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful
we had a one bedroom suite that wasnt huge but definitely served its purpose it was very clean and modern the bed was super comfortable and shower had a lot of water pressure 
in the lobby they had quite a few computers available for guest use we were able to check in for our flight and print off our boarding passes with no problems
the hotel is equipped with a gym and an indoor pool the gym had 2 treadmills and 3 elliptical all of which were very modern and equipped with individual televisions it also had a universal that was really nice some universals are awful but this one was new and fully functional
there is a restaurant as well as a little bar just past the lobby we didnt eat in the restaurant but we did have some appetizers in the lounge they had happy hour menu for both food and drinks the prices were good food was average in all fairness we only had a couple of appetizers the nachos which were really good and the hummus and the coconut shrimp both of which were average
most other times we ate out karl strauss is within walking distance and has fantastic food and a great selection of beer we also ate on the patio at the elephant  castle across from the uss intrepid really good food and a great place for people watching 
the hotel is also within walking distance to the gas lamp district where they have tons of restaurants and a pretty big shopping centre 
we would definitely stay at this hotel again 
the only complaint we did have was nothing that the hotel could control but a message to others who are staying in hotels please be mindful of your neighbors and try not to slam your doors ",5.0
topnotch hotel  staff,"we were very impressed with almost every aspect of our stay the staff  room were great we were in chicago for a few days for a wedding and reception that was held in the hotel which they did a great job with having it all under the same roof was wonderful our room was a cityview king room on the 15th floor the room does not come with a coffee maker but one was cheerfully brought right up upon our request we called relax  rejuvenate spa services to our room for a manipedi for her and a massage for me jessie  amy were great some posts accurately mention the seemingly everpresent sirens in chicago we never travel without our white noise sound conditioner its about the size of a pack of cigarettes and is great for masking just about any noise
two complaints the only complaint that we had with the room was that the ac couldnt be adjusted low enough for our comfort while sleeping in fairness to the hotel we never gave the staff the opportunity to correct it by reporting it
rooms were blocked at a discounted rate for the wedding that we were attending by my fault i was late in booking our room the rooms with the discounted rate were no longer available when i booked i called and tried to get a discounted rate for rooms that were still available without success i was hoping that they would work with me a bit
we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone without reservation",5.0
beautiful hotel with excellent service,"we were recently in new york on a weekend girls trip while planning our trip we were torn between the andaz and the london house nyc we ended up choosing the london because they had 2 bedroom suites that better met our needs 
while we were there we decided to visit the andaz for future reference we had lunch in their restaurant and it was excellent the service was relaxed and friendly after lunch we spoke with the concierge dana steer to see if we could see a room he showed us a magnificently appointed room that was very spacious by nyc standards he also gave us a tour of the hotel 
the andaz is not only beautiful and well located everything in their minibar is complimentaryas is room service coffee upon request they seem to go above and beyond to make the guest feel welcome and comfortable we will certainly stay at the andaz on our next visit thank you danayou were awesome",5.0

great room great service,"my wife and i stayed here on a saturday night we found the service to be excellent whether it was the front desk the phone operators or the valets all were extremely prompt and polite the bed was fantastic and the room spacious clean and quiet
we were part of a group of about 5 rooms and everyone had positive things to say about including my friend who went to get in an elevator and found a couple having sex in it good times
we paid 99 for the room and as written previously the valet service was pretty outrageous 54 with tax i too thought that 14 for internet service was a bit much
for 99 a night id go back in a heartbeat",5.0
modern sleek and great location,the view from the room overlooked the lake wow real treat make sure to ask for the view beds were clean cozy furnishings incredibly modern and expensive dont bring too many clothes because the closet is very small and no drawers for things like socks undies and bras the pool area is awesome wow concierge was very helpful and accommodating hallways kind of you do not need a car here everything is nearby shopping bikewalk trail music everything awesome smoothie place down the street that can fix you an alkaline recovery beverage if you drink too much the night before and an upscale bodega right next to that,4.0
awesome brand new hotel,"this is by far the best embassy suites ive stayed in if youre attending an event at the george brown convention centre it only takes less than 10 minutes walk the hotel is fairly new thus very clean and nice room is spacious with pull out sofa bed especially ideal if you have kids there is a door to the room thus privacy theres a microwave  fridge too
breakfast is awesome hot breakfast scrambled eggs potatoes sausages  bacon cooked to order scrambled eggs  the freshly made pancakes are awesome theres also oatmeal breads muffins  other pastries 
theres a managers reception from 530700pm with wine  some light snacks line can be very long if the hotel is busy theres a pool too 
rate may be a little high for an embassy suite but very convenient to the george brown convention centre 
valet parking is 28 per nite though",5.0

surprisingly nice,was very surprised by the size  cleanliness of this place it was like a cute little apartment with mini kitchen full size fridge dish washer 2 burner stove  dishware  flatware also had 2 flat screen tvs and the bed was comfy i found out upon arrival about the free breakfast and was surprised at the variety offered eggs sausage bread bagels muffins waffles cereal fruit oatmeal coffee juice  sodas it was pretty awesome there was a sitting room off the lobby complete with books magazines  family friendly games,4.0
cool and ok,the rooms and service was good with fun and clever design solutions our only complaint is that the pool by the poolside bar wasnt served by the bar the staff was very helpfull and had good knowledge of local facilities,4.0
fab hotel luxurious helpful and good location,the room was spotless with a lovely bathroom view of the space needle and very clean bearing in mind this was back in 2008 but i will always remember it as a great stay and would definitely go back pricey but worth it i thought,5.0
next to washington state convention centre  emerald city comic con,"if you want to be in the heart of downtown seattle you cant get any better than this location i booked in for 2 nights to attend the emerald city comic convention in early march 4 blocks away walking distance not a probably for haling my film gear  occasionally with my costume on 
if you are coming down from vancouver bc like me the hotel is just off the highway
i was on the 26th floor the view of downtown seattle is perfect sunrise view restaurant served simply and rustic breakfast the bar had a happy hour beer selection
good thing there were internet stations because i didnt bring my computer along but they do have wireless
slept well very quiet friendly staff",4.0
alexander there are better than this,this hotel is priced slightly lower than most other manhattan hotels for a reason the rooms themselves are nice enough but the shared bath is a pain in the butt there is only 1 bathroom per hall so you end up wandering the halls looking for an open toiletshower there is no complimentary breakfast and they even charged extra to hold our bags for a couple hours after checkout the comfort inn in the theater district was a better price free checked bags and complimentary breakfast with just as nice of a room and your own bathroom i am sure there are also several other better hotels than the alexander in manhattan which are in the same price range,2.0
great location but not great for families,"i just noticed the other review noting not a great family location and wanted to share another perspective while we found the costs of the hotel reasonable the rooms do not allow for a family of four to comfortably share a room if you are looking at this hotel i would recommend getting two joining rooms or looking at the courtyard airport the hotels double bed rooms have only full size beds and while i love my husband if we were the least bit overweight it would have been way too crowded in a full bed the bathrooms were beautiful but the wireless is 10day room is pitch black and soundproof  you will get a great night sleep
one reason we choose this hotel was the positive reviews however the hotel staff we encountered were ambivalent at best with the exception of the housecleaning who were top notch the other reason we choose this hotel was the location and that was amazing we had the best breakfast ever at richard walkers pancake house a short walk from the hotel and went to a museum",3.0
great apart from noisy local bar,crystal pier is a unique place to stay and we have just got back from a wonderful holiday some people have complained about the waves but then we were booked into one of the apartments above the office ie one of the sides of the entry arch these are bigger than the cottages but the bedroom overlooks the street and blind melons bar has fairly noisey live music until way after midnight  be warned,4.0
best bb experience,"i have stayed at several bbs throuhgout the us and five star hotels throughout the world the inn on ferry street not only met my expectations it exceeded them
the experience was wonderful the ammenities were beautiful and the restoration was top notch the area felt comfortable and the shuttle made getting around to the fox and that general area very easy the breakfast was an a everything from homemade belgian waffle station to yogurt cereal fresh fruit pastries everything was replenished and very fresh i would highly recommend this inn to anyone",5.0
good hotel for the price you pay,i stayed here because they had a good rate of 130 for one night incl breakfast the hotel was adequate very modern and bright but kinda cheaply done the room was a little grim as the window was tiny the breakfast was ok not great i would have preferred a starbucks but it was included so we had it all in all the experience was ok but i am glad it was only a quick one night stay the location is good close to quincy market and little italy about a ten minute walk to both,3.0
definitely overated itself,"we chose this hotel for its location and good reviews but we were very disappointed by the following
1 the decorations without much taste its image is far away from the so called  best boutique hotel in san francisco
2 the note about minibar and free water was confusing  made us think there is nothing free only on our last day we found out there is complimentary bottle of water per person per day we almost thought the teabags and coffee are free but its over priced we have to call to check and the person who anwered the phone couldnt explain clearly  poor english
3 only on the last day we found out there is complimentary coffee from 600 800 am the tea or coffee in the room are nothing free but over priced 
4 the front desk people didnt explain about the free services such as the free coffee to guests 
5 the room cleaning was very delayed  almost until the evening 
6 there is only duvet and no sheet between the comfortor and the sheet which is very weired the sheets are not vacuumed full of lints
7 the room is really very small for the price of 300weekend rate besides there is no parking at all
8 the manager will not allow a late check out  usually other hotels will give us until 200 pm but she gave us nothing not friendly at all
the only thing we miss are the door men they are very helpful in giving dinning directions and very nice 
after all we want to tell you that this is not the best boutique hotel in san francisco far away from it therefore please dont fool by the price its over priced",2.0
normally good  someone must have been having a bad day,ive stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions always good value unfortunately this last stay was spoiled by breakfast there were only 4 other guests in breakfast area little after 700am but there was no egg on buffet when i enquired i was told it was being cooked and would be out soon only hot items on buffet are eggs bacon gravy and biscuits plus their cinnamon rolls so i had 3 rashers of bacon thinking egg would be right out orange juice was also out and although im not a coffee drinker another guest asked if there was more coffee coming out never did get oj or eggs  eggs didnt arrive until i was leaving at least 10 minutes hopefully this was just a bad day because this is normally a great hotel to stay at,4.0
affordable style in a great location,"the palace hotel is a great base for a visit san francisco being just a short walk or ride from almost anywhere we really enjoyed our stay there the place has a sense of character and history presumably being built just after the earthquake the best part  the ridiculously cheap price we paid less than 240 pounds for three nights through expedia and that was for a slightly upgraded superior room that said best to consider it room only as you would have to be wealthy to use the bar or restaurant who needs to with all sorts of eating places just outside
the room was not particularly spacious but had two comfortable beds and plenty of storage space in all nicely furnished we did not notice the deficiencies in housekeeping noted by other reviewers the only downside was the lack of internet access really 20th century it is said there is a hefty charge for internet in the rooms but no mention in the room guide and the receptionist i talked to denied it existed there was supposed to be wifi in the reception area but i couldnt get connected and other people seemed to be having the same trouble
we used the hearst parking centre mentioned elsewhere but it would be better not to have a car at all the montgomery stop was right outside with vintage streetcars buses etc on the road trams below and bart below that cable cars only five minutes away although get there early to avoid the queues
in summary a great hotel in a great city",4.0
worst ny hotel in years,literally one of the worst hotel experiences in years the lobby is lovely but as soon as one leaves the lobby one is shocked the hallways are dirty with paint chipping and wallpaper peeling the room was dirty there is no way to control the air conditioning in each room  and when we called they said an engineer would come right up and no one ever did we had to call twice for towels and this for around 300 never going there again,1.0
i called the hotel directly bypassed hotelscom and they waived the per person room charge great hotel,newly remodeled super clean and spiffy nice pool and pit fires at night to sit around warm cookies when you check in great location to down town mission valleybeware of the parking fees 15 a nightouch,5.0
nice hotelbut had some issues,"just recently stayed at the hyatt from july 49
pros costumer services are wonderful the front desk and managers are more then accomodating when you have an issue received a free bottle of wine and a 50 dollar voucher when problems arose during my stay at the hyatt the fitnesspoolspa area is wonderful it is like your are at a real gym this area is not crowded and everything is very clean and neat also the hotels restaurant altitude had a wonderful breakfast they give you plenty of food and it was delicious also the breakfast was great but only enjoyed it because we got it for free when we booked the hotel if you have to pay for it then it is not worth it can be very expensive
cons
have to pay for internet you could go to 16 street mall to barnes and noble for free wifi but that can be annoying although the worst part of all during my stay was how you can hear everything from your room now i understand the hotel can not help this issue but be mindful when you book a room at this hotel request a room that is not connected unless your staying with a group of people the problem is you can basically hear everything in the room next door not fun when you are trying to sleep at 1200 in the morning and it literally feels that the people next store are in your room however when i complained about the noise the staff was more than accomodating to help which was really nice and appreciated also if youre staying here it is not really a hotel to stay for leisure because whenever there is a convention going on those people ie the shriners take over the hotel which can be annoying at times",4.0

radisson hotel fishermans wharf is a fantastic hotel,this is an excellent hotel in san francisco it has everything you want in a hotel first it has a heated pool for the very cool weather in san francisco second it has restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner it has a johnny rockets and it has an ihop inside of it it also has a very small fitness room the staff at the hotel was very friendly and the place was very clean the room we had was average size but the balcony in most of the rooms have an incredible view of the bay and alcatraz island the beds were very comfortable with the sleep number beds and the room was very clean the best thing about the hotel was the great location in fishermans wharf it is very close to pier 39 which is the most popular place in san francisco and it is near lots of restaurants all up the wharf also it is close to ghirardelli square altogether this was a great hotel to stay for families and tourists,5.0
homewood suites great for the family,upon the the recommendations of tripadvisor reviews we chose homewood suites on grand ave one block from the michigan avenue for a two night stay the week after easter it cost 179 per night plus parking we checked in an hour early and were given upon request a corner room on the top floor the indoor pool was on the same floor my wife and two daughters ages 8  10 enjoyed the pool and the convenience of walking down the hall to go swimming there is a free breakfast buffet and at 500 pm wine beer and a light dinner during the week the location was great and we had a 15 minute walk to the american girl store the conciergebellman rod was very helpful and got as a discount for the river cruise which was also a short walk from the hotel the entire staff was very friendly and helpful check out the homewood suites web cite for room details and prices,4.0
second time at this hotel  still amazing,i stayed here for the second time with friends from late october to november and absolutely loved it the hotel again is situated in a great location  a central point to all the sites we stayed here for halloween and it was insane it was the best experience of my life we went to the halloween party at the hotel which was fantastic and we also partied heavily for halloween on hollywood blvd which was also amazing we stayed in a junior suite and it was a great size and provided great views i would highly recommend this hotel  in particular during halloween because like i said the party they throw is amazing and the parties just outside the hotel are even better its in a perfect location for halloween fun and the way the hotel does itself up for halloween is incredible love the roosevelt,5.0
raining on our heads and beds,was very pleased when we arrived at this hotel it was clean and in a great location after a train ride down to the city and a night of sightseeing we were ready for a good night sleep went to bed at 11pm only to be awakened at 130am to water driping opened the bathroom door to a shower of water flowing out of the sprinkler head then water started pouring out of the sprinkler in bedroom and the the light fixture water was flowing from all parts of the ceiling tried to call the front desk but phones did not work went down to front desk were there were many more guests with water leaking front desk calling fire department did get another room on the other side of the hotel but this was a smoking room and not very pleasant to sleep in for people that dont smoke all of this and no compensation just a sorry this was an unforseen problem but some compensation should have been given,3.0

just adding another 5 stars,"the only issue was trying to use the elevator between 830  10 when everyone is either going to breakfast checking out or just leaving for the day they left voice mails warning people about the potential delay which i thought was very nice we stopped at another hotel where friends were staying and there was an actual line for the elevators so in the bigger picture it wasnt that bad
the included breakfast buffet was more than i expectedeggs sausage hash browns and hot oatmeal on top of what youd normally find on a free buffet coffee available 247
huge room for nyc so worth the extra money if youre staying longer than one night and with more than one person in the room the kitchenette had actual glasses silverwear etc which the cleaning staff washed every day theres even an ice maker in the fridge cuts down costs when you can have a few cocktails in the room  
1 block from the 42nd st subway entrance easily walkable from the liberty express drop off point at bryant park another winner from marriott",5.0
reliable for the purpose once again,i have stayed here twice in the past year or so both times were for a one night stay the evening prior to a very early flight out of cmh this is one of just a few hotels directly on the airport campus and this is where the value is together with the reliable free shuttle to the airport plus the convenient parking the facility is slightly dated and the carpet and amenities are in need of update although i noted that the breakfastsitting area in the lobby was under construction last month for an update no complaints at all about the service and you cant beat the convenience especially for a one nighter prior to an early morning flight,3.0
superb staff great location,"i visit nyc 3 or 4 times a year and think i have finally found the hotel i will book for every trip
my room and bathroom were clean spacious and comfortable the huge closet and window in the bathroom are rare in modern day hotels the only downside was the outside noise even on the fifth floor it was loud next time i will request a higher floor
the staff went above and beyond to make sure i was comfortable and happy jennifer remembered my first name after checkin and called me by name each time we spoke that has never happened to me before

similar to a w hotel,the hotel has a great location it is clean and friendly reminds me of a hip w hotel but it is not you are welcomed with a glass of champaign and greeted with a smile they have a complimentary coffee machine in the lobby area rooms are a bit small but were modern and clean the bathrooms are nice large and modern solid 3 star not a 4 star,3.0
excellent location and service,a friend and i went to chicago over the st patricks day weekend and stayed at the drake from the moment we arrived until the time we left we were catered to with graciousness and patience check in took only minutes and the concierge desk attendants marianne and donald i think took care of us very well making dinner reservations boat tour reservations and adjusting our tea reservation to work with our changing schedules  always with a smile the room was very clean the linens were amazing and the plush bathrobes were a pleasant addition breakfast was wonderful and depending on your room the views were quite good location was best of all,5.0
reasonable price great location free parking,ive stayed at becks many times over the last ten years it has been awhile since my last stay and a few things have changed theyve continued to renovate the rooms and have added fairly robust free wifi the lack of wifi was the one reason ive stayed elsewhere on the last coupe of visits you cant beat the location minutes walk to the castro minutes to muni and free parking while it may not be the fanciest becks provides a decent product at a reasonable price for san francisco,4.0

great service the rest is ok,as usual the ritzcarlton stands out in service very friendly staff and very helpful whether you need to know where to grab some food or where to shop however location wise i would only recommend this hotel for a business meeting otherwise even though the view of the statue of liberty is pretty nice theres not much to do nearby specially on the food front the only recommended restaurant is an italian place just next to the hotel the rooms are ok nice tub very small shower they room was clean and the bed was comfy but nothing remarkable all in all if youre main concern is service this is the place to stay if what you are looking for is great food and attractions stay elsewhere,4.0
pleasant stay at the gunter,we stayed here for one night on august 19 2011 we got a really good deal on expedia half off and for that price i would say i am very satisfied check incheck out was fast and without any problems we had a deluxe king room on the sixth floor the room was very clean spacious and comfortable the bathroom was clean too but a little small parking in the hotel was almost 30 so we found a parking garage one block away from the hotel and payed 9 per day we also liked that the hotel was really close to the riverwalk the only complaint would be that the room doors openclose very loudly so you can hear when everyone opens their door from your room also you could hear the noise from the street overall we had a good pleasant stay but if we had to pay full price we would probably stay at one of the other fancier hotels down the riverwalk,4.0

non smoking room with a smell of smoke,"we stayed 4 nights in the sheraton universal la our room 2 were located on the 18th floor with a view on universal studios wide views when we arrived in the rooms located next to each other we smelled immediately that someone had been smoking although it were non smoking rooms down to the reception where the staff did excuse the hotel for this and offered rooms on the 4th floor so we had to choose between smoke smell and view or no view and no smoke smell being in the opinion that the smoke smell would disappear we stayed on the 18th floor afterwards i can advise you that seen the fact that you cant open a window the smoke smell didnt disappear during our stay room service did their best with a spray we did by a febreze in the supermarket but no help 
some people complain about the size of the bath room indeed it isnt big and requires a good coordination between the room mates but everything was clean 
the breakfast buffet is good food including the fruits but we were missing some regular bread or toasts one can expect these basic ingredients for the price of the buffet
the service was very good up to the standard expectable for a sheraton hotel
the self parking is very easy close by and charged to the room simply easy and convenient
conclusion if nobody had been smoking in room 1810 before our stay i might have quoted this hotel a 5 star",4.0
perfect hotel,the maxwell hotel is located near many of seattes attractions and some great restaurants the hotel staff recommended amazing restaurants to us each day and we had a great stay i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in seattle,5.0
good but not for everyone,"we stayed here for 2 nights and were upgraded to a partial water view on the second night great beautiful location but this hotel is definitely not for everyone heres the scoop
location
right on the water close to the seattle art museum the views from the lobby are amazing right onto the water unfortunately it is right across the street from train tracks the last train on friday night was around midnight and the first one saturday morning was around 830 last one saturday night was around 6 pm a 5 minute walk to the aquarium along the water where you can get some yummy ice cream and gift shops theres also an amusement center with games and a carousel for the kids definitely take the elevator just a block or so walk away on the same side of the street up to the level of pike market from there it literally is a few minute walk away on the way there a world market is a great place to get cheap snacksdrinks 079 for a litre of water versus 329 along the waters they sell beer and wine as well with other house hold knick knacks 
hotel
as you approach the entrance youre greeted by an amazing outdoor fireplace and water fountain great views from the lobby floor to ceiling windows looking over the water its definitely has a unique decor fancy alaskan decorations i wouldnt call it tacky as others have i quite liked it this hotel has been awarded the 4 diamond rating from aaa 4 years in a row according to the plaques on the wall great seating area in the lobby a couple of fireplaces parking valet is 33 plus tax 40 total per night thats standard for all downtown seattle hotels we stayed at the westin once and it was 40 as well after reading reviews we parked across the street in a parkade its where all the cruise ship passengers park their cars only 20 per day safe and secure in my opinion it closes at 11 pm and no in and out privileges theres an attendant until it closes then the doors shut 
checkin
greeted warmly by a cheerful lady no problems and she upgraded us for the second night
room city view
as per previous reviewers no matter what floor youre on request a higher numbered room for example 238 is further away from the street and the noise than 211 our room number was in the 30s so we were kind of in the middle we could see the space needle and part of the harbour traffic noise was busy friday as lots of people were in waiting to board the cruise ship the next day the train wasnt too bad with the windows closed but it does cause a low hum much louder when the train blows its whistle i wasnt too bothered by it but i can see how others might be the room was on the smaller side but comfortable nice flat screen tv the bathroom was nice yet small as well i didnt mind it but can see others wanting a bigger one lovely rain shower head granite tiles in the shower good ac each room has a gas fireplace nice touch the room was definitely decorated nicely like a lodge a fully stocked fridge but no safe you can give valuables to the front desk some parts of the room was squeaky so not sure how the people below us felt 
room water view
the next night we were upgraded to a partial water view wow what a difference the rooms were much bigger there was also a bear that acted like a foot stool the patio was nice 2 patio chairs and a table we looked onto the cruise ship docks a cruise ship was docked so it obscured part of the view but we could still see out onto the water fairly well wow nice very nice you could hear the water once the cruise ship left at 4 pm the view turned out nicer we sat out on the patio and soaked in the view definitely cant be beat i can only imagine what the full water view is like being on a lower floor we could hear at times the people above us as well as the bathroom it really wasnt that bad but i can see how it might bother some 
amenities
no pool business center on the second floor with 2 computers with free internet a lounge and a restaurant with gorgeous views didnt try the food but smelled good there is a gift shop on site theres a free shuttle that will take you i believe anywhere within a mile or two 
overall
i would recommend this hotel based on the excellent staff and location if youre a light sleeper then im not so sure unless you have a room furthest away from the street the rooms are good even the city view we were lucky to have been upgraded city view is 355 but partial water is definitely 45",4.0
stop by the club,nice stay here with a friend in downtown boston the service desk was super nice and held our bag for us after check out the pub next door is pretty cool until all the kareoke singers get drunk but no worries you can just stumble up to your room make sure you grab a purified water from the station in the hallway ,4.0
not terribly impressed with the old town inn,we arrived at the old town inn on 77th for a one night stay i was extremely excited to stay there after reading all the fabulous reviews here on tripadvisor all the reviews i read praised david as being a wonderful host when we checked in david was helping another guest on the phone and seemed to be going out of his way to help this person searching for a vacant hotelthey were booked going as far as looking up phone numbers for this wayward traveler what great customer service unfortunately as david was busy we were checked in by sarah who has a lot to learn from david it seems she was curt short and never offered so much as a smile or a welcome the room being a non smoking room smelled musty and old sheets came off both beds throughout the night they dont seem to fit the pillowtop mattresses as they should i would reccommend this hotel for someone not looking for anything special just a clean place to sleep at night i was extremely disappointed as i expected a lot more,2.0
the knowledgeable professional and friendly staff make this an excellent choice,i have stayed here before and will do so againat least as long as my child remains at uw the hotel is well managed the experience from reservation to arrival to stay to departure compares with luxury hotels in terms of personal attention and friendliness if there is a notable detracting feature it is the limited exercise facility bring along a trx the hotel is not luxurious but makes up for that in cleanliness and comfort as well as very good value the free shuttle service is a nice touch and makes getting around for the uninitiated out of towers easy the gm don is extremely approachable and very responsive his front desk manager max and revenue and guest services manager senada are superb and attentive i particularly like the top floor suites lovely balconies made for cool crisp evening with friends wine and tapas try this hotel you will not regret it,5.0
washington square  standards are slipping,"i returned to this nyc hotel in october 2009 for oldtimes sake really way back on my first ever trip to nyc i stayed here and enjoyed it so eight years later it was time to go back
initial impressions remain positive wellpositioned near the bohemian greenwich village the hotels located down a quietish side street waverly place and is two minutes trek at most from the subway station the subway station is served by the line directly to the jfk airport station so thats an added bonus and theres a great diner across the street
checkin was friendly and quick unfortunately it would seem that not a lot if any work has been done to the rooms since 2001 although they remain comfortable and have free quick internet via a cable supplied by the hotel my one real gripe was service and cleanliness obviously the room i stayed in was not vacuumed by the maid and evidence would suggest little other than making the bed was carried out
surprisingly a bin wasnt provided in the room that said one doesnt really expect the previous days mcdonalds wrappers and newspapers to still be present when returning after a days exploring  so it would seem a littlelot of work could be done in that area for the price  over 200 dollars per night for a single room  its not really good enough that said id probably stay there again",3.0
hope new managenment turns it around,"stayed here two this in the past month rooms somewhat dated no internet this time and was told by from desk sorry you are on the wrong end of the building so i checked out new manager said they jad ordered parts 
also there is nothing around it you can eat at the windys or the truck stop this hotel is off of my teams travel list now",2.0
very nice resort,my wife daughter 20 years old and a couple of friends travel to phoenix for the first time in may we stayed a week at the marriott canyon villas which we picked up for a very good price through interval int we arranged transportation from the airport through the resort i believe the outfit was called destinations driver was todd very clean vehicle and more reasonably priced that a cab or limo service we own at a marriott timeshare in myrtle beach and this resort although set up slightly different is very nice we stayed in the two bedroom unit while our friends were in a lock off efficiency unit the two bedroom unit is furnished very well beds are exceptional plenty of living space dishes washerdryer which come in handy 3 tvs kitchen with appliances set up is similar to our timeshare in mb the lock off is fairly small but worked fine for two people with a king bed couch and small fridge coffee maker all units have decks we were in a 3rd floor unit in bldg 2700 overlooking the pool a couple of units overlooked the golf course others didnt have too much of a view the activities at the resort worked out well for us we played the two golf courses on site both were in very good shape alot of traps but fair off the tee and fairly large greens we lounged by the pool several afternoons never had a problem finding a chair the pool bar is a good place to get a lunch and a cold beverage or two beverage manager matt is top notch my wife and daughter took advantage of the spa at the jw marriott a couple of times while i was golfing and they said it was heavenly we took one day trip through detours to the grand canyon picked us up a 7am returned at 7pm fairly expensive but definetly worth it dont get sold on only going as far as sedona beautiful red rocks but nothing compared to the grand canyon we ate out most everynight the desert ridge mall is within a mile and offers several resturants and shopping the keg was a good steakhouse reasonably priced and the yard house offered about as many different beers as i have ever seen tgif maraconi grill were also good went into scottsdale one night to the capital grill very good food and environment but overpriced compared to some weve been to we went over to the jw a couple of times during the week only about a 10 minute walk and a shuttle is offered at times but we never seemed to match up the jw is outstanding the grounds pool spa are all top notch ate at rayes which was very good the one thing we found a little dissappointing at the canyon villas was the market place only the necessities very small really had to go the jw or mall if you needed anything overall we really enjoyed our trip to phoenix and the cannon villas id recomend it to anyone with small children to retirees that are just looking to relax,4.0
great hotel great location great service,i just stayed at the belvedere and i loved it its a great location on 48th st right around the corner from hotels costing 300 a night on broadway you can walk everywhere to bars restaurants nightlife there are several metro stops also the hotel is clean and the staff very helpful and friendly from the front desk to the doorman the rooms were really nice with a fridgesink there are a few grocery store shops right around the corner on 8th stif you want to stock up your fridge everything in the hotel looks new from marble floors in the bathroom and lobby and nice bed linens this is definitely nys best kept secret we paid only 144 a night and you cant stay anywhere else for this locationcleanlines and price definitely recommend staying here,5.0
couldnt be happier,beautiful place  clean comfortable with grest amenities full facilities and stellar staff styaed for 3 days in offseason and found everything to be close to perfect spacious rooms in well tended grounds friendly and helpful staff though never obtrusive left some important documents in the room when we checked out and they had them in a ups envelope to me later the same day,5.0
feels like old town comfort,a really cute inn located close to old town san diego a quaint exterior hides modern rooms the staff was very friendly and the continental breakfast kept is full for the whole morning all of the comforts of a hotel with the feel of old town and for a great price,5.0
relatively expensive,we stayed for 4 nights the room was clean and service good but our room was tiny and located on the south side so very very hot to give you an idea i had rinsed a pair of jeans and this was completely dry in about half a day 90 usd is a lot for such a small and hot room,3.0
dont drink the water,i have stayed at this marriott twice in the past 30 days and both times i came home with bad diarrhea i suggest bottled water during your stay,3.0
very nice property a little isolated,"stayed here for two nights with my son property was very clean and updated staff was friendly offered recommendations and provided great assistance rooms have views on both sides harbor view or runway view sounds from outside are very muted however hallway noise seemed to be amplified as i could hear quiet conversations as if i was standing next to the person in the hallway also the room thermostat didnt seem to keep the room as cool as advertised 
exterior of the property has great landscaping and an amazing view of downtown across the harbor food offerings are a little sparse with one restaurantbar being offered transportation options tofrom the hotel are great water taxi service is directly at the hotel for 10 per person there is also the hyatt shuttle or the port authority shuttle to the terminals the t or the bus lines 
one small thing to note this seems like this is a large wedding destination on the weekends i would be wary of staying here on the weekends because of this",4.0
great location for business in the financial district quiet  comfortable,"i really love this hotel for convience to financial firms located here the room is one of the quietest rooms in which i have ever stayed upon checking in and going to my room which was immediately off of the elevator bank i almost asked for another room but decided to give the room a try to my total surprise i never heard anyone getting off the elevators or even talking in the hallway complete quiet and i dont believe i have ever experienced this type of quiet 
my room overlooked the statute of liberty which wais quite beautiful and comforting i checked in on 911 and thought the view was fitting as a statement to our continued freedom
service seems to be good as all was in order upon my return from meetings in the evening shower is nice and bed is extremely comfortable room is large by nyc standards with lots of work space great home away from home
i highly recommend this hotel for the business traveler as well as it would nice for families or couples",4.0
loved the ritzjust make sure to have a room on the highest floor,"my husband attended a conference in san francisco and i tagged along to see the great city of san francisco the ritz carlton is a beautiful hotel the lobby is gorgeous and the hallways are decorated with artwork from local artists that depict famous landmarks and scenes 
after flying into san fran from nyc it was late and all of the restaurants were closed luckily there is 24 hour room service it is expensive my husband and i ordered salty chicken fingers and fries cheeseburgerfries along with two sodas and it came to 60 i later read the fine print on the receipt and there is a 4 delivery charge so i think there is no need to tip i did anyway i also ordered room service the next day for breakfast which was a 3 egg omelet cheese spinach along wtoast and a coffee that came to 40 after the first day no more room service though i must say the breakfast was superb 
the room was spacious and the sheets were phenomenal 400 thread count make it hard to get out of bed the ritz also has different pillows to accommodate you fluffy soft hard the room had a 32 flat screen television with a wide selection of movies to order from wireless internet service is available the room was also equipped with a bose system that allowed you to plug in your ipod bulgari also provides all of your toiletries i loved the turn down service i would come back to my room exhausted and have chocolates on my bed a copy of the latest headlines from the new york times and the local jazz station playing it was so relaxing and thoughtful 
the location is perfect and a 2 minute walking distance to chinatown union square tons of shopping bus stops trolley stopsand grace cathedral
the entire staff was very knowledgeable i needed walking directions to the murals on balmy avenue and there was a line at the concierge also extremely helpful so one of the bellhops just asked how can i help you how awesome is that he gave me directions and i was on my way i wish i had gotten his name because he was very helpful the cleaning staff was awesome i think my cleaning ladies name was yalitza she was phenomenal
the only problem i had with my room 360 was that it is what i would consider the bottom floor in order to access the room you have to take the elevator one floor down to the 3rd floor which i think is the conference room floor then walk down some stairs to access my room it was directly across from the kitchen and above the beautiful courtyard besides the steps which is not recommended for disabled visitors it was loud on the last 2 days of my stay there might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning i also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise to be honest i expect to have a great room at the ritz especially for someone who pays 500 a night i was a tad bit disappointed in the room i am sure i could have switched rooms but it was late and i did not expect to hear noise two nights in a row
 i have visited the ritz carlton in new orleans and they are all beautiful hotels with attentive staff all in all i enjoyed my stay at the ritz carlton and i would visit again
i hope this review helps someone happy travels
there is parking available at the ritz but it costs 60 a day you can park for 40 a day around the corner at st marys parking lot you can also rent a car from the hotel if you need to",4.0
friendly centrally located boutique hotel,"hotel vintage park is centrally located in downtown seattle it was very easy to get to the shopping areaspike place market and a few good restaurants we did not have a car and it was very convenient to get around
the staff at the reception were all friendly and helpful it really only took a couple of minutes to check in and out we were offered a coffeemaker which was delivered within 10 minutes of our arrival with coffeesugar etc all on a tray 
the room was spacious with bathrobessocksumbrellainroom safe inside the wardrobe and actually had plenty of hangers as well the bathroom had good lighting also with all the amenities that we needed our king size bed was comfortable with good pillowssheets we liked the decor the couch and bed were not clattered with cushions lots of modern hotels have heaps of cushions these days and we usually have to move them around to create more room our room was on the top floor so we had a leafy outlook of the city
the wine tasting evening was a nice social occasion to meet fellow travellers especially for the single travellers we really enjoyed it
we joined the kimpton intouch so we got free internet throughout our stay and it was great to be able to keep in touch with friends and family 
this hotel is just so unique one has to stay there to experience the difference  we will definitely stay there again when we are back in seattle next",5.0
horrible,for a four seasons they should be ashamed of themselves horrible front desk service noisy rooms small suites that would be called a room in any other midrange hotel change  would not recommend to an enemy,1.0
love the pearl,"we stayed at the pearl for two nights before catching a cruise if you are looking for some quiet rr in the evening this is not the place for you the rooms are groovy and modern with a bit of a retromodern theme going on no complaints whatsoever and they use h20 spa products huge flatescreen as well
the hotel is also a loungebarrestaurant which is pricey but delicious the place gets packed and noisy at night hence the lack of silence in the evenings i would not recommend this hotel for the traveler who has a low noise tolerance to the party scene atomostphere the scene is sophiticated and trendy so it is not like a drunken bar scene just loud with groovy music playing
we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay there again downtown is a bus ride away and if you dont have a car it may not be the place for you it is good value for the price and worth checking out even just for a drink",4.0
good experience for price you pay,i selected this hotel based largely on the overwhelmingly positive reviews on tripadvisor i think that maybe my expectations were a little too high dont get me wrong we had a positive experience and paid a great weekend rate however i was not overwhelmed by the experience we found it to be typical of any other residence inn the location is great the staff was friendly at front desk staff was almost nonexistent in the breakfast buffet again positive experience but not memorable,3.0
love love loved the staff,my husband myself 2 teenage boys and our dog spent 3 delightful nights at the onyx hotel as others have noted the staff at this boutique hotel were superb we were a bit nervous traveling with a pet but were greeted at the door by a welcome willy sign accompanied by dog biscuits and water the boys had made an error when trying to watch a movie and the staff were gracious and nonjudgemental in refunding the amount the room decor was sumptuous the bath products of good quality and the complimentary wine hour was a treat as for the location we walked every night and at no time did we feel our safety was compromised again the staff were adept at suggesting walking routes restaurants and the best way to exit the city we would most definitely return,4.0
brilliant hotel in great location,"this was our first visit to nyc and had booked hotel chandler as it was a good price and in a great location all of the positive reviews on this site are correct  this is great place to stay
we didnt spend too much time in the room but when we did we found it was very comfortable quiet even though near a lift and the aircon did a great job the staff were great didnt have to deal with them much beyond checkinout but were very helpful and arranged a taxi for our flight back
we stayed in a superior queen room which had a flat screen tv a safe free to use and was able to access the free wireless connection the shower was brilliant and the bed very comfortable several people on here have said the rooms are small  although theyre not massive theyre more than enough for two people plus luggage etc
we went in the bar only once but it seemed nice and a beer was onlt 2 in happy hour
everything we wanted was walking distance from the hotel empire state is about a 2 minute walk and times square and central park were not too much further we only used the subway once but found it easy to get to
would definitely stay here again",5.0
location great but not overall,great location especially since we were there for a wedding in the sheraton ballroom but many negatives no hot water we complained were told an engineer would take care of it but nothing changed there was no way to cool down the room apparently at some point the hotel switches from air conditioning to heat and there is no going back turning down the thermostat just causes the heat to blow less hate paying for internet and parking but that seems to be the norm any more for hotels at this level,3.0
beautiful hotel but rooms disappointing,"i have just returned from this hotel and overall the hotel was stunning inside but our deluxe room was dreadfull it was small and with no heating working outside i could of been staying anywhere in the world as all i could see was 3 brick wall and a generater  i imediately complained and was told that there were no other rooms available which was an absolute joke eventually after sleeping in our robes we were moved the next day to a slightly better room 
the location is great and we have brad and angelina staying there but some how think there room would be a bit nicer than ours",3.0
this is worse than terrible,we were faced with an extremely bad and disgusting service at the milford plaza hotel we checked in flying all the way from niagara falls to buffalo and then to new york arriving on december 28 2011  at around 1130pm  100 am when we arrived at your hotel the two security guards  doorman told us that the elevators were broken and that we had to carry all four of our luggage up the stairs to our room we asked for a bell service but they told us that there was none and that we had to deal with it ourselves please look back at your camera footage this is the worst service i have ever seen by far for a hotel of your nature we booked your hotel for new years weekend and hoped to enjoy ourselves but instead found that the service your hotel provides is horrible and in fact racist coming from an asian descent we felt that the doormansecurity was extremely racist towards us due to our race and did not want to help us at all i was with my wife and two kids and with a total of 4 luggage even a passerby another hotel guest was willing to offer their help to us even a homeless person would offer their help seeing the conditions we were faced with in addition to the horrible service we received upon arriving the hotel room smelled disgusting similar to new plasticremodel obviously nothing was done during our stay to help compensate this fact,1.0
like being a president  a diamond members treat,"we booked this as hiltonhonors diamond reward stay and we were extremely pleasantly surprised that  because all executive rooms were booked  they double or triple upgraded us to the presidential suite  wow what a suite it was indeed location of hotel also excellent lots of stuff at walking distance parking indeed expensive but its expensive everywhere downtown chicago breakfast was  although the food itself was great  the only poor point of this hotel it seemed disorganised and there was constantly a line of people wating to be seated although there were empty seats abundantly available one person taking care of that and she did other things in between as well also we had to wait like 20 minutes for our coffee and then it came twice ie dont go for breakfast if you are in a hurry 
but again this is truly a great hotel and next time well go there again also as paying customer",5.0
the best room the best service,the service was outstanding everyone went out of their way to assist us the rooms were amazing  comfy beds incredible water views luxurious bathrooms great products and in room espresso a quick walk to the north end where you can find shopping and dining a beautiful area for a morning walk we will definitely go back soon,5.0
nice place for a business stay,pleasant staff clean rooms great free breakfast in room coffee maker actually had coffee that was drinkable i could go on but the bottom line is this is a good place to stay my only gripe is the beer selection at the managers reception free beer choice is bud or budlight really  how about something local to the area maybe killians coors i know fat tyre is pricey but i decided to skip the free drinks and buy something brewed locally thats just me and it did not affect my experience,4.0
this is the best boutique hotel in the city,i travel over 170000 miles a year for work and have stayed at the michelangelo hotel many times before recently took my daughter for weekend of broadway plays and restaurants this hotel is quite frankly the best in nyc for service rooms with a sense of belonging and comfort and location james the concierge can steer one to the best restaurants and out of the way dining places and the location is superb my first introduction was business but since i have been back 5 more times truly a great find,5.0
i will never come back again,i came to nyc with my daughter for broadway shows as i would like to stay in an area which is not far away from time square just within walking distance when i saw the website mentioned that this hotel is centrally located in nyc to many locations such as time square i chose this hotel because i had a good experience in staying excelsior hotel in hk for many times however i was quite disappointed about the location the room is not as good as the standard of 4star the tv channels are not clear wireless internet paid was slow this hotel is totally different what i have thought about the brand of excelsior when i complained with the front desk staff she was really not patient,2.0
comfortable and reasonably priced,i found the motel to be comfortable and clean with a friendly staff the only negative i can say would be the sporadic and weak wireless internet service,4.0
great hotel but why does the bar close so early,we are marriott members and stayed at the renaissance using our points we chose it for the location which cant be beaten if you want to be central after checking in we headed straight to the renowned r lounge only to be found that all the prime seats were reserved the service in the bar was not particularly friendly maybe because we werent eating and the drinks were very pricey but the views were undeniably special we were going out for the evening but decided to come back later for a night cap to our huge surprise on returning around 1am we discovered the bar was closed lights were full on and the bar and lobby were being hoovered we were informed there was nowhere else to get a drink which seemed incredible in a residential hotel in the centre of nyc what happened to the city that never sleeps the rooms were nice enough and we enjoyed a good breakfast but we wouldnt choose the hotel again given the limited bar service after hours,4.0
no real complaints but no wow factor,most of the basics are there comfortable bedbedding good plumbing acceptable service attitude and rooms that have aged relatively well the confirmed gold passport diamond upgrade landed us a park executive suite or at least that was what the front desk agent called it the 1br suite was spacious and contained 15 baths a long sofa and a square living room table in lieu of a more traditional work desk no work surface in the bedroom we took advantage of the loaner bicycles at the concierge for the cost conscious the valet parking is 48 per night perhaps a way to describe the property location would be near the center of everything but close to nothing except for the independent cinemas on the back side of the hotel but not a big deal if you are planning to drive everywhere as we were while i would rate this property ahead of the williard in comparison to park hyatts in asia this location falls way short,5.0
the charm of lax two days before christmas in the tsa wore black suits,"excited about the w opening and reading good restaurant reviews we made a reservation at delphines we pulled up in front of the hotel gave the car to the valet and were greeted with a chain of velvet ropes and men in black suits who did not say welcome to the w but rather where are you going we told them we were going to delphines we were asked if we had a reservation we said yes we were asked our names we told them we were then passed through the velvet ropes and into reception area the restaurant was on the other side of the lobby which is essentially a giant nightclub to cross the lobby we met man in black suit 2 he asked us where we where going did we have a reservation what were our names testly we answered again and we were passed through on the far side of the lobby man in black suit 3 allowed us to pass into the restaurant where the hostess said how are you doing to which we replied not so happy about all the velvet ropes she was nice seated us and we proceeded to have a lovely meal fabulous food reasonably priced great service and we were wiling to let the bad experience pass because the food was so great we paid our bill and then proceeded to leave the restaurant where upon we encounter man in black suit 4 who said where are you going by this time we were ready to blow up we said to our car after spending over a 100 we now have to go through the indignity of three more men in black suits and three more velvet ropes to leave the manager was called two managers arrived one listened the other yelled directly in our faces we both blew up so here you have two men in their 50s well traveled sober properly dressed screaming at the top of our lungs in front of reception with this evil managerbouncer while peopel are checking in to 300 a night rooms 
while we did not stay in a room and we cannot vouch for the rooms themselves i can assure you we will never set foot in the place again if you want to experience the indignity of the old studio 54 in new york where people begged in get in to spend their money then this is the place for you
a perfectly lovely meal was ruined by hotel staff who have no idea what real security is about and never once was the phrase what can we do to make this right uttered amid the staff shouting

we used alternative parking at the hyatt regency,"we stayed here 2 nights on our week long trip in april and really enjoyed our stay very much i had researched the nearby parking in planning our stay here and thought we would be able to park at embarcadero 4 but when we drive in the guard told us that parking garage is now only for monthly rental she directed us to embarcadero 3 which turned out to be even closer we were less than half a block from the front door of the hotel for 30 for 24 hours
we loved the hotel the view of the ferry building and bay has to be at the top of the list next would be the beds pillows and linens best beds on our trip the lobby and elevators are beautiful we did not eat at the hotel but there are small restaurants in embarcadero 4 and across the street all and all a very nice hotel",4.0
clean  comfortable not as good anymore for airline passengers,"the hotel is clean and comfortable while it used to be at the airport the new terminal is now 7 miles away we used the park n fly service which doesnt work as well anymore the shuttle service goes only once an hour we were actually left because we were only a few minutes early and saw it going down the road it came back for us when we got back to the airport after our trip we found that the hotel was not on the shuttle service kiosk and our cell phone would not work in the airport to call their bus
we would recommend it as a decent reasonable place to stay but the park n fly service did not work",4.0
aleja and teds adventures,if you are attending the denver merchandise mart this is by far the most convenient place to stay you need not leave the building to access the mart they do provide a breakfast and there are friendly staff at the front desk this is no ritz i have stayed here a few times to attend the mart and i must say the shower heads and hot water are always a treat if you do not care about staying so conveniently close to the mart you should stay somewhere else and have a rent a car to get back and forth,3.0
great location will stay here again,"our hotel room was a queen with shared bathroom and was bigger than we expected facing 77th street ne there was a nice street view and sunshine in the morning very comfortable bed good sized tv chair and suit case horse and wardrobe but no draws we were missing the information guide but no big deal the shared bathroom was fine much less of a drama than we thought three rooms are though a hall door with a bathroom which is not accessable to other people the bathroom already had a lot of other peoples toiletries in it which was no bother and we therefore left our bathroom bag in there but found it in the hall the next morning unsure whether this was other guests or the cleaner

super hotel  with character,"stayed for six nights in december and im looking forward to being able to stay again
for those who cant be bothered to read long reviews my summary
 great sleep quiet and comfortable
 characterful and friendly
 good price
 good location
 dont eat the carrots
for those with more time on their hands
how very very nice it was to stay in a hotel with some character rather than the bland formula of an hotel like a hyaltorriott i found the general feel of the omni very comforting  like theyve been taking care of important people for years and i was in good hands i might not be considered that important by many other people  but they appeared to find me so and i enjoyed going along with it
a huge positive point for me was the fact that i slept like a baby like a baby asleep in a beautifully quiet room in fact this hotel is made out of good solid materials not the usual plasterboard and echoey corridors of an ant hotel i wasnt once kept awake by frisky neighbours or woken early by the splash of showers or slamming doors of hastily abandoned rooms good sleep  good mood and good work
in comparison to other business district hotels i found it very reasonably priced i loved the morning delivery of coffee and juice that was included as part of their rewards programme oh how such small things make such a difference to the way you start your day
other than that  friendly helpful staff and great location for the business district although its a little way from the tourist hotspots its no big deal to jump in a cab for five minutes or travel by public transport  or heaven forbid use your legs
the one and only issue i stumbled across in my stay was in the steak restaurant  so maybe its not that fair to post here  but since the restuarant is affiliated and theres a pretty good chance that guests will gravitate towards it i will
the issue the gigantic phallus of a carrot that was delivered on my plate reclining in its selfsatisfied way against my mightily overpriced and presumably very embarrassed steak
that long lone carrot was quite honestly the most revolting vegetable ive ever eaten  and that includes the times ive accidentally bitten into renegade pieces of celery food of the devil in a salad i cant believe the carrot had come from anything other than a huge tin of brine and a ten year wait in a dusty warehouse somewhere
if youre a beef aficionado  or even just someone who likes good food  just dont bother yes the steak tasted good  but not an eyerolling conversationstopping stresssapping umamiridden explosion of great that id expect from a steakhouse charging that much per pound of beef
oh and that carrot gack",5.0

loved the buena vista,we stayed here for part of our honeymoon and couldnt have been happier because this was our honeymoon we didnt want to stay at any bigname impersonal hotel chains and this place was perfect the staff was very friendly and helpful and the location is close to fishermans wharf which is where we spent most of our time we also loved the charming decor of this hotel  especially the lobby and the sun room on the 3rd floor we didnt find the buena vista noisy at all  quite the opposite we cant recommend the buena vista highly enough  would never consider staying anywhere else in san francisco,5.0
not great,the lobby is in repair and the hotel is very dated and dark the layout is a little quirky too it was okay but wasnt great,3.0

great hotel that goes out of their way to make you at home great location,very friendly staff all around with daily breakfasts and nightly welcome home meals with the manager this place is tops for families and those staying for a few nights like we did overall we really enjoyed our stay our only complaints were that the hotel seems a little out of date in some areas the beds were not the most comfortable and had an annoying bottom cover that was plasticlike and made you sweat at night the underground parking was not well lit and if you somehow forgot your key card there was no way out but overall the staff was friendly and warm great location within a short walk to safeway resturaunts and the space needle will return next time were in seattle,4.0

smooth service,"i picked the omni because it was the highest rated hotel near the convention center well it certainly was near 5 minute walk to the far reaches of the exhibition hall and the hotel was superb everything worked well or was immediately fixed upon request the breakfasts were terrific 
but best was the smoothness of the service at all levels all the time personable refreshing to have an easy talk with a bellman on the way down about tips helpful and efficient overall id rank it with my best business hotel experiences
btw my 20th floor room looked down on the padres stadium from the bathroom no noise pollution and quite a sight to see a night game",5.0
good price  terrible customer service,the price and location were good however the other guest in the hotel were loud at night 3am banging on doors and cursing this happened on several floors i had many friends staying here on various floors the rooftop club attracted questionable patrons who freely roamed arond the hotel  security was basically nonexistent at one point we went to the rooftop to see the view and the bouncer at the door insulted us in how we looked and how we were dressed and would not let us in overall i would not stay here again complaints to the front desk about these items were ignored,2.0
this is not a hotel,"we went there in spring 06
after a long drive from the socal we finally arrived boardway manor inn after dark we were placed on the 2nd floor the corner one of boardway and van ness
we requested a non smoking room but the room just smells like were in smoking area the bathroom is nice but not the room
it was so horribly decorated that they use some flithy white cloth as curtain to the window facing boardway
the cloth so thin that i can even see the traffic light at the corner of van ness and boarway
also the traffic on van ness is so noisy that it wakes me up several times during the night
so i was waken up by noises and the green red green red yellow light at night
not only this but the bed is horrible
i just felt like im floating on water when sitting on it and when two of us me and my husband sit on it the bed just made some cracking sound were just sitting not even sleeping
so we went to the front desk but all other rooms are fulled and we were hungry and tired so we decided to stay there for only 1 night carefully lay on the bed and were frighten we will break the bed in the middle of the night
they claim to have free parking but their parking is so tiny that its so difficult to get out of the car after parking it in the space
also there were not enough space
we were just so lucky to get the last parking when we arrive so we just simply left the car there and take bus right across the street on van ness to fisherman wharf
so after a warm dinner we got back and went to the front desk asking for password of wireless internet and they asked for my room card i gave them and they checked it and said im not their customer so they are not giving me the password
i was likeif i were not a customer so how can i get your room card
so my husband went there with the receipt we got from checking in and they finally gave us the passcode
i dont know is their network so bad or only because we are at the corner room the wireless receiption is just so bad that it just go on and off and on and off and on and off and i just couldnt even check emails
so i gave up and went to sleep carefully
the other day we left the hotel immediately 
we were on a week trip and sf is our 2nd night thru the norcal trip so we stayed in 4 nights of hotels after thatand all our clothes and belongings just smells like they were being smoked in the smoking area
so we eventually have to do laundry in our friends home in the south bay
its such an unpleasant stay that i would rather get more  from my pocket to stay in a much better hotel
all i can say is the only good thing is the location
staff are rude and impolite and unhelpful",1.0
clean and roomy,there are quite a few hotels in the hotel circle we chose the days inn because of the reviews on trip advisor the room was large and clean internet is included in the reasonable rate as well as parking ok breakfast can be had at the nearby diner the fashion valley shopping center is within walking distance and offer everything you could need when it comes to eating and shopping if you have your own car it is very easy to get to both the old town and sea world there is also a shuttle service which supposedly stops by the hotel but the hotel staff did not have much information about it so we ended up using our car instead,3.0
not what it used to be,rooms are extremely small no wireless internet there updated rooms have a flat screen tv but there are a bunch of wires sticking out all over the place the elevators didnt work for the 23rd floor access and i had to go to the front desk twice to get it fixed,2.0
glad i booked at hotwire price,i booked the room using hotwire which most likely reflects the room we were insmallest hotel room i have ever seen we were on the 4th floor of the north tower room was so small they could only fit a table on one side of the bed room was clean staff friendly for the price i paid it was ok location a little shady at night next time would pay more for a better location nearer to inner harbor,3.0
friendliest staff beautiful lobby  rooms with special touches like a handwritten welcome note from the maid,"i have stayed at the sf omni several times i live locally and cherish weekend getaways with my husband several things set this hotel apart from other nice hotels they know how to create a great first impression through their great valet parking staff and friendly doorman who greets you with a warm hello upon entering the hotel marbled steps lead you down towards a sunken lobby canopied by a crystal chandelier fresh fruit and lemonade are offered to guests the desk staff are warm and helpful every hotel employee says hello the first time i stayed at this hotel i noticed the housekeeping staff greeted us on our way to our room not just a hello but with a big smile the spare roll of toilet paper was tied with a satin lacy ribbon the end of the rolls are folded to make a double point and are embossed with the omni seal their toiletries are really nice a handwritten note from the housekeeper awaits you near the phone welcoming you to you room 
we usually order room service and the delivery staff are quick and nice bobs steakhouse restaurant selections are available for room service and i have enjoyed lobster tail and perfectly cooked steaks delivered right to my room i
f you get a room on the chinatown side of the building the cheerful sounds of chinese music can be heard from your open window for outings we have found the front desk staff helpful and the really go the extra mile to help you they are even friendly when you check out it is the special touches and interactions with the staff that set this hotel apart and make it our number one sf place to stayi just wish i could take the sf omni with me to every place i travel they should run seminars for other hotels on hoe to provide first class hospitality",5.0
excellent service and great location,i recently had to stay there because of my job the rooms are nice and clean and the staff is always friendly and courteous you cant beat the price and location the best value in the area i would definitely return,4.0
outstanding in every way,this is truly a five star hotel it is essentially a luxury condominium property that rents rooms but the advantages to this approach are numerous the rooms are beautiful large and very comfortable with full highend kitchens living rooms and from 1 to 3 bedrooms each with a full bath the staff is very friendly and helpful a complimentary breakfast is served daily and there are lots of other perks such as a huge dvd library and free local transportation plus the location is great somewhat expensive but worth every penny,5.0
more than i ever expected,chose this hotel because it was the cheapest rate for a decent downtown hotel that i could find this hotel was close enough to make almost anything downtown an easy walk with the one exception being the willis bldg which is not close to anything we walked to shopping the theater district and the art institute for other tourist attractions greyline has a trolley stop right across the street we booked a city view room but were delighted to find our room was a corner river view room with an absolutely gorgeous view of the river and city if i ever stay here again i will pay the extra we spent so much time watching the boats going up and down the river the room itself was beautiful with a huge bathroom no bathtub but a wonderful raindrop shower found all the hotel staff to be helpful and friendly and elevators were no problem there is an attached resturant called hoyts i thought it was overpriced for breakfast but they have a lovely sidewalk lounge if you like to peoplewatch this hotel is not far from the trains but far enough away to not have to deal with squealing rails all night whats not to love,5.0
good location,"we took our 2 young kids there to support my sisterinlaw running in the marathon
location the location is great theres a hopon hopoff doubledecker bus stop right in front of the hotel the ticket is 32 per adult for 2 days its a wonderful tour it showed us the whole washington dc in 25 hours the metro centre subway station and the macys department store are just around the corner it was also perfect for the marine corps marathon as were able to walk to the 12 mile checkpoint and cheered for my sisterinlaw there arent too many restaurants near the hotel though with 2 young kids we didnt want to go too far so we ended up having both dinners in the hotel restaurants which are not bad and reasonably priced
facility the swimming pool is nothing grand but good enough for my young kids to have fun the gym seems quite spacious and well equipped
service cookies and lemonade are offered to guests in the front desk  lobby it was great especially when we arrived tired and thirsty but they dont refill it at night if you arrive late  thirsty you can buy a large bottle of water in the souvenir shop for 3 the one in the room was 5 i called housekeeping for a crib and they came set it up almost immediately all the staff greet us happily the only thing isthe metro grill restaurant seemed to be understaff for dinner
price we stayed fri  sat night and paid 209 nite  tax with a sumptuous breakfast which is pretty good for the nice room decoration though not big and no view and convenient location i booked through the hotel website its funny how they keep changing the prices every few hours just like the stock market i was lucky to finally get hold of this reasonable price
ill definitely stay at this hotel again for my future trips to washington dc",4.0
comfortable stay,had no problems at check in agent was friendly and accomodating i showed my spg starwood preferred guest card and were given welcome bags for both myself and i which included a bottel of water a granola bar and coupons for restaurants a nice touch our room was kind of a mix of old and new the rug looks like it could be updated still had an older tv and there was a slight cigarette smoke smellmost likely due to being an older hotel we were woken at just b4 midnight on the 1st night of our stay due to a hotel alarm that was going off they resolved this within a half hour fortunately the beds are so comfortable that we were able to go back to sleep right away the pool looked great although we never got a chance to use it they did have a nice area for sunbathing right next to the pool they had a sizeable  of workout equipment such as weights treadmills and bikes but the area was right in the hallway on the way to the pool unless we missed it i saw no locker rooms or whirlpool there are a couple of restaurants on sight as well as a lounge area just off the lobby the location itself was fantastic as it was close to a number of attractions i did receive an email a couple of days later thanking me for our stay which may be a canned response becuase im a spg member i would have been more impressed if i got an email apologizing for the inconvienice of the alarm going off the hotel is billed as a 35 star mostly becuase of the on site amenities and i think with a little work they can achive that but for right now they are a solid 3,3.0
a shared bath that is not adjacent to your roomin all my travels i have never experienced this,this hotel is in the midst of remodeling and our view was of the debris piled on the roof upon realizing the shared bath was down the hall and shared by 3 rooms i produced my handicap placard and explained there was no way i could negotiate down the hall in the middle of the night it was after 11pm and we were in no condition to find another hotel with much insistence from my husband and myself we were given a handicap accesible room and told there was an addition 50  feeper night for the private bathroom this has got to be a violation of the laws relating to disabled persons perhaps i didnt investigate enough but in 20 years of travel this is something i had never encountered even in the most economy grade hotels the room was nice and newly remodeled and the location was good,2.0
great hotel near convention center,the room was clean and neat we had a nice view of the mississippi river from our room we had to pay for internet which was a bit of a bummer but it is literally across the street from the memphiscook convention center so the location was at least good we were able to walk a few blocks to go out to dinner although there was a restaurant at the hotel too all the staff was very nice and helpful,5.0
great location  steps from times square,"i stayed at this hotel in november 2009 and the location is excellent steps away from times square and broadway
the hotel itself is dated but the rooms are reasonable and the shower is hot this is all we needed as we didnt stay in our room much  only to sleep really
had no problem with staff  they seemed fine and the concierge was extremely helpful we had a late flight back on our check out day and we only paid 1 to leave our bags
i wouldnt recommend buying ticket for empire state broadway shows etc in advance because its much cheaper when you actually get there
12 to get the ferry to staten island which included entrance to the statue and the museum
47 for a ticket to see chicago and we had great seats
we ate at planet hollywood and several little delis which were great value shopping on 5th avenue is brilliant i would recommend a trip to abercrombie and tiffanys even if you dont buy anything the experience is brilliant
just remember to budget for tips because you are expected to tip everywhere
hope this helps",4.0
right off i95 close to good restaurants,"i stayed at this hotel right off of i95 across from the white marsh mall on whim this is the first fairfield inn and suites i have stayed at 
the hotel is in a very convenient location to the i95 corridor just north of baltimore md the hotel is located directly across a major street from the white marsh mall and ikea directly beside the hotel is a taco bell and mcdonalds on the night i stayed here which was a friday the mcdonalds parking lot was occupied by all of the local teenagers luckily from the room i was in i never heard them from the hotel 
the hotel has a complimentary trolley that runs between a couple of the local hotels and the the avenue there are several great restaurants stores movie theater etc at the avenue 
the room that i had was adequate and there was a good amount of space my room have two queen beds there is a 32 tv in the room with about 30 channels a few of them are hd internet they have wires and wireless in the rooms is complimentary as well as parking there is a hair dryer and ironing board and iron also in the room as well as a cuisinart coffee maker can make about two small cups of coffee
check in was quick and efficient and the front desk staff was very nice the room overall is in great shape i will have to say that in the bathroom it was not spotless but relatively clean some hair in the shower from a previous guest housekeeping started knocking on my door about 930am and it continued about ever 20 mins until i checked out something i have never encountered before
the lobby has breakfast in the morning complimentary and they sell sodas snack etc",3.0
avoid this hotel at all costs,"absolutely the worst customer service i have ever experienced in 2 decades of business and leisure travel  my husband and i have maintained gold hilton status on both of our hilton honors accounts for years and this is the only time we have been treated so unfairly booked 2 rooms for spring break then had to cancel 24 hours out due to a childs illness was told by the manager that he would release the rooms back into inventory but 5 days later he charged our card anyway we have an email stating a 24 hour cancellation policy but the rude manager refused to reverse the charges then gave me a bogus phone number to the presidents line to call to complain
google this hotel and managers name to see that there have been other incidents with this manager and this property and dishonest practices how on earth can this franchise maintain the hilton name when they do not follow the hilton policies and level of customer service
avoid this hotel and find a marriott",1.0
i would stay there again and again,i travel alot and usually always on a budget i think the most important factors i take into consideration are location and price on this basis the hotel is a steal now if you understand before you go that these points are what make the hotel great then you also understand that with the low price you must have to sacrifice ammenities i am perfectly willing to give up tv i was there in times square no need for the tv when i got back to the room everyday i was happy to have ac and a decent bed to sleep on the shower was small the phone did not work there was no maid service towels are scarce but if you ask for them they will give them to youterrible view but i slept like a baby and i could hop out into the action of time square within seconds i read all the reviews and was a little freaked out by the talk and pictures of bed bugs but if you look at the dates of those reviews that was a few years ago during the big new york bed bug epidemic and several hotels had that issue i did not see a bug or mouse i have no bites on my body so if you can handle the sacrifices and want to take advantage of the great location and price this is a great spot i will go back again and again without thinking twice,4.0
solid business hotel,stayed for two nights very good location near financial district but also walking distance to great shopping  speaking of which westfields shopping centre on market has the most plentiful shops plus the embarcadero has good shopping as well my room on the 7th floor appeared to have been recently renovated was a little loud though with the window open as the cable car was right outside i thought the front desk staff were great my air conditioning wouldnt work and as a result i had a poor nights sleep but i should have let the hotel know and asked them to fix it,4.0
they did it again,"i cant believe they did but they did it again  my first stay was here at the dana was back in 08 and boy did i thoroughly enjoy it my recent return last weekend to the dana was spot on perfect even better than my first stay
immediately upon arrival the guy out side at the stand very nice and knowledgeable helped us with parking and showed us where to check in a young lad andy front desk excellent service and very professional showed us our room on the map and answered all of our questions regarding the facilities what an awesome experience the room was beautiful flat screen robes big mirrors and even a mini refrigerator to keep the coronas chilled and the view of the bay perfect
we went out that night had an awesome time in san diego and woke up the next morning wishing we had more days 
overall great hotel and even better staff",5.0
not on par with ritz standards,was very disappointed with the service and the room decor many of the small details here are being missed,3.0
great hotel would recommend,i liked everything abt this hotel i would highly recommend its clean nice location etc,5.0
decent choice for the price,"my boyfriend and i stayed at the ramada inn this past memorial day weekend overall the facility was decent we had a small corner room on the 7th floor the room was on the small side but it had all the necessary amenities tv with remote radio lamps desk ironing board and iron hair dryer and was clean i was especiallly pleased with the size and condition of the bathroom the shower control knob was a little loose but that was the only issue with the bathroom we had a slight problem with the iron had to jiggle the cord to make it work and the service could have been friendlier since i am from new york i didnt need to interact with the staff frequently but i expect someone from out of town might appreciate betterfriendlier service
the biggest problem we had with the room was the presence of bed bugs i found a big one on the blanket one morning which was disgusting when i complained to the manager he said these things happen and offered to have the maid flip the mattress and vacum it im not sure either of these things were done but we didnt see anymore bed bugs 
overall i would recommend this hotel for a budget traveler who doesnt plan to spend a lot of time in the room this hotel has a great location and the price is good however i will probably look elsewhere first before staying here again",2.0
hotel windsor stay is economical and ideal,"we had a wonderful stay at the hotel windsor staff was very accommodating and the room was spacious and well appointed full kitchen dishwasher microwave and large size refrigerator is a wonderful perk the location was terrific close to museums and within walking distance to historic sites and nice restaurants we did not have a parking problem whatsoever pulled into the garage bellman took our luggage and car was whisked away a wawa market around the corner was extremely convenient for popcorn tea bags etc for late night snacking in your room only downside was noise level outside even at 3 am there was a clamor of activity also sheets are a bit threadbare 
rooms come complete with vcr but no tapes to rent at the hotel staff was unsure where a a good rental place was all in all i would recommend this facility to anyone good price good location",4.0
really nice hilton,"i stay at hilton hotels about 60 nights a year all over the country and this is one of the nicest i really enjoyed the view of the ballpark and the great fitness room
the hotel public areas and rooms are updated clean and very comfortable i will definately stay here again when in town
my only complaint is that the concierge lounge breakfast was not as nice as others i have experienced very limited breakfast and snacks",4.0
could be fine for some travellers but we hated it,"i didnt get the best deal i could have on this stay which just makes me all the more irritated about the allerton i attempted to contact inhouse reservations prior to checkin to discuss adjusting my rate i felt a bit entitled as i was booking for an entire week at the end of a miserable chicago winter but i never received a call back due to the circumstances surrounding my trip i didnt have a lot of time to badger management about this issue so i let it be and hoped that the hotel would impress regardless 
i will say this the rooms are very pretty there were some issues with peeling wallpaper but it was not that noticeable beds have feather toppers and feather pillows undisclosed on the web site so i now have a sinus infection from a weeks worth of constant exposure on a side note i didnt figure out that the pillows and topper were feather until nearly the end of my stay at which point removal would only have served to make the bed more uncomfortable these are flat pokey featherbeds not the highend kind so wear thick fleece pajamasthe ice machine noises the ac was making when i arrived were easily remedied by turning climate control off the windows are a nightmare dont open them this hotel is right across from northwestern hospital so be prepared for ambulance noises at all hours i guess if you are a big shopper the location could be a selling point for us beyond being nice to look at this place is absolutely not worth your time at the price 
my first room standard king was very spacious plenty of room for yoga and it even had a chair and a bench unfortunately it was also right next to the elevator i grew up in a town with trains and planes so i got used to the whooshing fairly quickly however the doors here do not go all the way to the floor and they are thin thin thin i rolled up a towel and shoved it under the door as a sound barrier but it made no difference at all after the second night of no sleep due to loud conversations outside my door at all hours of the evening i insisted on being moved the gentleman at the front desk did not argue about switching my room but he did point out that there was no way he could prevent people from having conversations outside my door in the future regardless of location between exhaustion and frustration i had to talk myself back from punching him in the jaw why would people randomly stand around my room assuming that my room wasnt located at the gateway for entering or leaving the floor really 
room 2 also a standard king was much smaller and was one of those rooms with a door joining it to the room next door remember how thin those doors were our neighbors loved ray lamontagne acoustic guitar singalongs and noisy sex yay i could not bear the thought of moving again and they at least kept it quiet most of the night this is the room i was in when my husband got into town and its the one we stayed in the remainder of our trip it was a bed to sleep in and nothing more hes never going to let me live down not going with his first choice the blake",2.0
solid choice in the upper east side,this hotel is lovely great location close to the park and in a very nice neighbourhood quiet and upscale efficient bell concierge and front desk staff nice room clean and decent size for manhattan no complaints,4.0
great hotel if you can afford the upgrade,"i stayed at this hotel at the beginning of july with my girlfriend
we booked a standard room and were allocated one on the 1st floor the room was very nice and clean if a little small which is what we expected however looking out of the window all we saw and heard was the air conditioning unit we asked to be moved and were moved to the 7th floor where we could still hear it and were looking out on it we complained again and were told that all the standard rooms looked out on this area 
we had no choice but to upgrade our room which cost us 350
the new room was excellent and money well spent it was very big and looked out over the lincoln centre 
all this aside the hotel is good and we enjoyed our stay once we had a nicer room we tended to get used to the good staff on reception and the not so good so waited until the good staff were working before we asked for anything
all in all i would stay here again and anybody going shouldnt be worried",4.0
in the heart of the alamo,the hotel indigo at the alamo is easy walking distance to that attraction and the transportation hub of san antonio we were on the 4th floor and could see the wall of the alamo from our window we had a great deal with a groupon and ate in the 1909 bar and bistro two evenings and 1 breakfast mike is a most informative waiter and aims to please,4.0
cheap,clean sheets so and so carpet  street its as cheap as they come in san fran you get what you pay for,2.0
there are better hotels out there,"the pluses
the hotel is in a good location if you want to stay in the fishermans wharf and be close to northbeachchinatown
excellent beds if you need a lot of rest and not interested in being out this is a great hotel for it but then again why pay fishermans wharf prices when you can stay somewhere else with much better rates
the rooms have recently been upgraded with very comfortable plush beds flat screen tvs and new fixtures 
theres a decent size lap pool and jacuzzi
theres also a work out room and a laundry room
the negatives
absolutely no view i had one of the better views on the 5th floor i paid extra 20day to upgrade so that i can view the coit tower when i got to the room i realized that although i can indeed see the tower theres a much better view of the petco 76 and cost plus market their store lights prevented me from leaving my window open to see the better view in the distance
the wireless internet is not free this is sf folks we have the most amount of free wireless in the us tip i managed to use the wireless connection from the radisson nearby for free
 although this is supposed to be an upgraded room the dresser bulb is missing and theres a bulb out in the bathroom there is also no mini bar and no real desk to work in
 there are never enough towels and they are not nice towels
 the hotel guest information book is outdated and incomplete we ordered room service and half of the menu items were no longer offered and the prices are wrong no information in it on where amenities were ie pool check out time etc
 if you do decide to stay here youll be tempted to order room service dont the food is not very good and is over priced not to mention does not come as it is described on the menu for example the continental breakfast for 1095 that comes with a basket of danishes actually has two very very small danish same size as a sweetener package plus a 2 cup pot of coffee and glass of orange juice to top it off we were charged the new price of 1695 plus the 250 delivery and the 18 service charge the corned beef hash tasted like it came out of a can and the baby back ribs had no bbq sauce as described on the menu ive ordered room service in every hotel ive ever stayed at and understand that the prices are always exurberant but i am more often than not satisfied with the food not at this hyatt
 the elevator is located in one section and is not in the center some people are lucky enough to be located near it but for most its going to be long trek
 parking is 36 a night regardless if youre a guest or not tip there are free parking spaces at the end of beach street for 4 hours maximum and near the argonaut for max 2 hours
overall its not the worse hotel you can be in but there are better choices out there",2.0
our trip to new york was amazing,the hilton garden inn was a perfect base for our trip to thebig apple we were on the dorr step for many of the tourist sites the empire state buidling was 5 minutes walk away as was macys the rockefeller centre and madison square gardens were only 10 mins away the hotel staff are polite and courteous the hotel is clean and the rooms are well equiped the business suite was a god send for checking emails and printing off directions and maps from google  would definetly stay there again on our next trip to new york,5.0
felt safe but just the basics,i stayed at this best western because i read the reviews of the bw president which were not very good i really rely on tripadvisor for the truth location was probably the biggest downfall but it is in manhattan this hotel felt safe because it was near the nypd in the middle of the night we heard bullhorns pulling over cars although it is a bit of a walk to activities aside from the convention center it was adequate for one night the staff were very nice and the continental breakfast was adequate it is best to walk towards the convention center and then take a right for night time walks that way you walk by nypd which is more than safe walk up to 42nd st and turn right there was a great restaurant along the way called cafe josephine as you walk up 42nd st it starts to light up the room we had was small but clean no frills i would stay here again if i had to go to the convention center which is right across the street the price was right at around 200 night during thanksgiving weekend,3.0
beware incorrect charges to your credit card,"pros
 nice decor with character and chic touches
 good location
 smart room design and use of space
 large shower
 lounge with live jazz singerband was fantastic
 one concierge male was very courteous and helpful
 great taqueria a few doors down that serves delicious authentic mexican food
 free wifi code obtained from concierge
cons 
 incorrect charges on credit card after visit completed and everything had already been prepaid and confirmed by concierge the charge was discovered days later when the credit card bill arrived and was for parking despite the fact that no automobile was ever used during my trip concierge had actually confirmed specifically when i checked out that i had no parking during my stay after 2 months of trying to follow up about this it was finally reversed but due to currency conversions i still lost money
 breakfast ran out every morning typically by 830am with extra food not being brought out for other guests and i even when other guests asked on different days
 elevator broke down the last day while two guests and i were inside trying to get to the lobby to check out on time for our flights the emergency call button didnt work could dial out but nobody could hear us on the other end despite the call going through several times and the emergency alarm didnt work either we were stuck going up and down for 20 min until we manually stopped the elevator and opened it by hand we were lucky someone was waiting for it because otherwise the outer door would have remained magnetized and we would still have been stuck concierge did not apologize
 two concierge employees both female encountered seemed inexperienced and therefore not particularly professional one of which was borderline rude
 toiletries were not automatically replaced every day
 suggest bringing ear plugs we were given one of the quietest rooms and the street noise was still quite loud
 drinks at the barlounge were expensive and small and i live in a city where drinks are notoriously expensive
 inconsistent level of service at the barlounge on different nights during busy popular evenings the staff are clearly of a differentbetter calibre on quiet evenings staff are completely different and much less experienced
fortunately i paid very little for this hotel stay due to a promotion at the time i would have been much more disappointed had i paid 100 or morenight",3.0
can be great with faster renovation,the carltons room and lobby was nice and presentable during its renovation but i had to wait for almost 5 hours for my room they have offered me a room to freshen up but i wanted my room to sleep in before i go to my brooklyn tour the front desk was very nice and sympathetic while i wait for a room when i finally got my room their hot water in their shower did not work the price for the room was okay but i hope their services improve their hotel management will suffer if they do not finish their renovation soon,2.0
great location big hotel shuttle is quick food options are lacking,pursuant to the other reviews it is a big giant and as expected hilton nothing bad nothing special location is very convenient for work travel but should be the only reason you stay here  airport access bar is good area to meet other peers from work but other than that nothing spectacular tired cliche boston food such as chowder and the nothing on the menu really stands out food is soso would stay again for airport access,3.0
nice indoor parkpoor rooms and guest services,upon arrival i had one room reserved but purchased another to accomodate everyone with me due to the fact i was told i could purchase two extra bands during a previous phone call which would of been an extra 5000 verses 25300 i checked into 302 and 304 302 was not clean i immediately called the front desk they were going to send up housekeeping well housekeeping went in and walked right back out without touching anything i went to the front desk with pictures of the room i was moved to another room but was away from my family into room 366 way around the building they werent even considerate enough to keep us close yeah i received 2 free breakfast coupons big deal so later that night in 366 i go to shower and bout fall and bust my head on the bathroom floor where water is standing i call the front desk she says well its raining and sometimes that happens mind you the 4th floor is above me not the roofwould you like for me to send someone up like i was supposed to fix the problem or clean it up myself so a man comes up takes a look and says oh its just the air conditioner unit like that was okay he finally says well i can move you to another room if you would like so we are now moved to 470 around the building and upstairs from the rest of family that we were vacationing with and oh yes given another free breakfast the next morning upon checkout i asked to speak to upper management about the issues and gave them their free breakfast back because it was not worth what i had paid to have a stress free vacation i was looked at like why and asked what part of management i told the lady my problem since she needed to be so nosy and all she said was sorry you had a bad experience and never got management but i asked for a paper complaint form and it plainly states ask for management before departure if you have had an unsatisfactory stay so please beware of the rooms and being able to speak with management for a resolution elevators work poorly as well,2.0
what a mess,do yourself a favordont stay here my wife and i were going to a business meeting and after arriving we walked into the hotel only to be met wth a very strong stench of bleach the hotel lobby is a mess and after checking in and going to our room on a very run down elevator which there was no inspection tag in we had a hard time opening our room door after we opened it we could not get it shut and i mean we slammed it to try and still wouldnt shut i had to go get the manager and show him and he gave some song and dance the phone didnt work and management was aware of this the bathroom looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks we were told that if we spilled anything on the already stained carpets that our credit card would be charged another 250 the room stunk of bleach so bad that we decided to go up the street to the quality inn which we booked a new room we went back and talked to a nice lady at the desk who was treated like dirt by management she stated that she could not refund us any part of room charge i have spoke with the man that runs the hotel he refuses to refund any money i will be disputing the charges with my bank and calling every day to get refunded dont stay here,1.0
good location great staff,the location of staybridge is hard to beat if you want to stay in midmanhattan you can take the jfk airtrain change to subway line e and reach the hotel in less than a hour with little cost the suite had everything i needed niina nick and other staff members were very professional and helpful there was some construction going on nearby waking me up pretty early but it happens in a big city yes some patience is needed with the elevators but never more than a couple of minutes alltogether a very enjoyable stay,4.0
nice short spring break trip,we enjoyed a 2 night stay at the public i was a little concerned as i normally like the hotels closer to michigan but won this one on priceline it was beautiful weather during spring break for chicago and we made use of their free bikes we were allowed a 2 oclock checkout which helped as we had a 7 oclock train we chose to ride the bikes on the lake side trail and used the lobby computers until it was time to head to the train station we ate a lou malnatis which is close by as well as a barnes  noble it was first time in this area the hotel was very clean be forewarned my husband is very cold natured and there are no blankets on the beds he called guest services and had a couple of comforters sent up it was a very nice stay,4.0
great location hotel was okay but would not stay again,"when we got to this hotel they could not find our reservation so we had to wait an hour this was not good for two young girls travelling alone from england this was our 2nd stay in the city but our 1st stay at the moderne we would of preffered to of stayed at th milford plaza like last time but the hotel wasnt available for us through thomas cook 
the receptionist was very helpful when finding our reservation
we asked for a fridge which cost 20 where as at the milford it was free we wait 30mins for the man to bring it up we got the impression as we had not tipped him straight away for bringing our luggage up he took his time for our request as my sister after 20mins went down to reception as he was just sat there after he brought it up we were a little annoyed as we wanted to go out straighaway so we did not tip him for his shoddy service
the room was okay for just the two of us it had 2 three quarter beds
the heater made the room too warm even when it was turned off the floor was slanted and it was at the reception are near the desk too
the safe was ridiculous it was battery opperated and we felt we didnt want to put our valuebles in it as we were worried the batteries would die out at the milford it was electronic
so we had to put our money and passports etc in our cases and lock them and put them up on the shelf in the closet out of site  
the only great thing about the hotel was the location  5mins from times square and 5mins from central park",3.0
fabulous stay,"i have stayed at this hotel several times and am more impressed each time every staff member is friendly and gives exceptional service it is not new but a very elegant classic remodeling was going on during our stay but it did not bother us if new and shiny are more important to you than quality and class then you might want to stay elsewhere this hotel is for those who appreciate old world charm and service
i might advise those who are allergic to feather pillows to look in the closet for a standard pillow 
we ate at the champagne sunday brunch for the first time on this trip and were amazed at the variety and quality of the items served we will definitely make time for the brunch on our next stay we cannot imagine staying anywhere else in san antonio",5.0
margie cooper was super,we arrived on the thursday before memorial day for a 3 day weekend in san antonio margie cooper was the manager on duty she was excellent very professional friendly and very accomodating to our needs we took a day trip to the hill country to see the different wineries i bought two bottles of wine then i realized how am i going to get them home margie came to the rescue she said i could send them home fed ex she sent all the shipping supplies box tape up to our room she is excellent i want thank her for making our stay a pleasant experience my wife and i decided we will make hampton our number one choice for our many trips in retirement thanks again to margie people make the difference in any organization and she was the best,5.0
great location and great price,we stayed for two nights at the gaslamp plaza greeted by a enthusiastic front desk girl named merry she was a lot of fun and handled our check in swiftly rooms are nice and large we had a one bedroom suite room had two tvs and a mini fridge and microwave as well as plates and silverware parking is 28 a day but the valet service was excellent the only drawback is that at night when you are ready to hit the sack the noise from all the people that are partying can be overwhelming since the hotel is located right in the middle of all the clubs but you can get free ear plugs at the front desk or better yet just go party with the rest of them and then hit the sack,4.0
nice hotel good location,"stayed here three nights for business it was a good location for my meetings but the area does largely close down at night the business center is off the lobby and charges for internet access and printing other than boarding passes they also charge for internet access in the rooms  a big pet peeve of mine parking was 20 per day but very efficient
room was nice other than poor water pressure and noisy water pipes  not unusual in an older hotel occasional noise from airport but not bad
the staff were extremely friendly  valet always remembered me front desk was very helpful etc
i would stay here again when in san jose",4.0
nice hotel surrounded by offices avoid the lodge,"stayed here for a couple of nights for a work event this hotel has all the usual luxury collection elements extremely attentive staff faux french decor golf course etc and thats all great except if you are staying in the lodge
the lodge is seperate wing on the other side of the golf course approx 10 minutes walk to the main hotel along a main road they will drop you off if you ask the decor is trying to emulate a hunting lodge with pool tables huge stone fireplaces and big oversize lounges the lodge has a lovely deck at the front overlooking the golf course and the beautiful trees of the queens city which would be great except my room was overlooking a parking lot and the office building next door
hotels spend a fortune trying to create a style which works only for some of the rooms in this case the problem isnt in the execution of the place its the location trying to place a french chateau which looks across to a hunting lodge in the middle of an office park really doesnt work to make the illusion of euopean grandeur credible 
the room itself was nice with a large jacuzzi bath and a king size comfortable bed overall a nice hotel with quality finishes and excellent staff",4.0
great property,rooms are a bit dated and the valet parking price is outrageous but the staff is amazingly accommodating to any request every room has a balcony hilton is refurbishing this property and i look forward to future visits,4.0
overpriced for the room,"if judging this hotel by room size and condition it was adequate and average nothing great and nothing too bad rooms were relatively clean but for the price over 350 a night  yes i know it is ny but this was early april for a room with 2 queens i felt it was overpriced the bathroom was tiny i was staying with a friend and there was very little counter space in our room to even store our toiletries 
the room was relatively clean but there was no ac or ventilation to speak off we tried turning down the air or raising the speed of the ac fan but it was very warm and stuffy at night we could not open the windows due to the loud traffic and frequent sirens during our stay 
being a hilton gold member we received free internet access but it was not easy to log on using my ipad my friend was able to log on using her phone but i was never able to connect we were given vouchers that were worth 19 towards a breakfast this covered a continental juice coffee fruit bar pastry bar or a take out coffee and pastry the full breakfast buffet was 36 glad to have the free continental but have had much better at 2 star hotel 
best rating for this hotel is for their customer service  it was friendly on checkin at concierge desk hint go early lines are long unless it is early am even though they had 23 ladies on duty every time i passed and in the restaurant second best reason to stay is location close to theater district central park midtown etc easy to walk from here
biggest pet peeve they charged me 350 a bag to store my luggage when i checked out i needed to store luggage for 3 hours before leaving the city this was a first for me have not experienced this even in europe maybe i have been lucky but i did resent the sign telling me to pay in cash on pickup and informing me that despite it being a paid service they were not responsible for any valuables ",3.0
a nice part of seattle,"our 9 day vacation in the pacific northwest ended with a three day visit to seattle the city has so many interesting areas i had a hard time deciding where to stay i am so glad i choose the silver cloud inn on lake union
 we had an upper floor with an upgrade for a lake view it was worth it because at night we could look out our balcony and off to the side we could see the space needle during the day you could watch the seaplanes take off the hotel is very clean and the room was more than enough space for the three of us husband wife and 14 year old daughter 
the best part of the hotel for my daughter was the make your own waffles every morning out on the beautiful sun roombreakfast area there were many items to choose from on the breakfast buffet and it was complimentary 
my husband and i used the free shuttle service that the hotel offers we took it into town for the pioneer village underground tour that was so much fun the tour guides are full of fun stories and goofy jokes they kept the tour moving right along and you learn a bit of seattle history history teachers should be this amuzing at the end of the day you call the hotel and the shuttle bus comes to get you it was amazingly efficient friendly and free 
the hotel staff was very helpful in giving recommendations on places to eat and travel directions they always greeted you as you came in and left for the day they seemed proud of their city and their job
 the hotel also offers free parking you didnt need a car to walk to the restaurants along lake union we had two fine dinners at dukes try the halibutyummy reasonably priced and the waitress was so nice to us
 you cant go wrong with this hotel i loved seatle and got to catch a fish at pike place fish market",5.0
memphis graceland,a refreshed motellooks good overalla fridge and microwave and hairdryer and iron big queen size bed which was comfy and clean the downside are that the sink drain doesnt drain and the plug wont fit the bath a vast improvement from motel 6 downtown we purchased a gorgeous sandwhich from the deli across the road i would advise again just to watch the area at night as the liquor store has bars on it and a few bad people around,3.0
chic but a bit pricey,"ive stayed here several times over the last couple of years and quite like the w seattle its a very chic very trendy hotel with a great location but the prices are a bit steep the staff is very professional and efficient from the valet to the doorman to the front desk
the decor is very design hotel and the theme is dark and cool it extends to the corridors and rooms the room decor is dark purples and blues this is actually a really good idea in seattle since come summertime the sun is up early and down late it makes sleeping a lot easier they have the wsheraton heavenly bed which is just that  ive seriously considered buying one for home theyre so comfortable the bathrooms on the other hand are only mediocre
overall i think its a pretty average value and would stay here again",3.0
what a place to stay at,first time at staying at this hotel and i would be very happy to come back again all the staff were very helpful and friendly not like the last new york hotel we stayed at we were here to celebrate my wifes 50th birthday and they made it as special as anyone could i did not arrange anything special with the hotel prior to arriving however the hotel manager mike obtained a wonderful cake for her at no cost to us and also the kitchen staffwaitresses also made a breakfast cake out of a freshly made waffle complete with candle and all sang happy birthday to her the hotel its self is just as it advertises great location for touring new york clean and tidy rooms very functional nice beds with adjustable firmness control not to noisy however you are always going to get a certain amount of noise in the city that never sleeps and we were situated on the 14th floor at the back and experienced very little and nothing that disturbed our sleep,5.0
top quality hotel,my wife and i stayed at the affinia dumont from 25th sepember till 29th september 2008 when we confirmed our room booking i asked for a high room with a view of the chrysler builbing this was from recommendations by previous trip advisor travellers we were told by the hotel that they could not guarantee this as the hotel was fully booked however on arrival we were taken to room 2904 and we were not to be disappointed we had one of the most spectacular views that i have ever seen the chrysler building and midtown new york lit up in all its glory a magnificent sight to go to bed to at night the hotel was spotlessly clean the staff were professional and courteous they even have a pillow menu 5 different types of pillow from soft to hard never had that in a hotel before the hotel is only 4 blocks from the empire state building about 5 to 10 minute walk about 15 minute walk to macys and 20 minutes to times square broadway contrary to reports before we went we found taxis to be clean quick and reasonably cheap we used one from jfk to our hotel it was cheaper than the train 4 of us were travelling  45 dollars which is the standard rate to anywhere in manhatten plus a 4 dollars 95 cents payment for a bridge toll a deli that i can recommend for breakfast is cafe metro great value and everything cooked fresh and to order in front of you it is on the corner of 370 lexington 41st a great start to the day and anybody wanting a great steak try juniors at 1515 broadway and 45th street a famous new york steak house we had a 20 oz sirloin with all the trimmings,5.0

great city,we had a wonderful time in san francisco the city is truly magnificant we stayed in a very large suite which was great the breakfast was wonderful the food generally was superb the pool was fabulous if not a bit too crowded and it was in the best location possible it was well decorated especially the dinning room and the building was very opulant and the service was some of the best i have exeperianced in the us i just wished we had stayed longer,5.0
unexpected gem in sd great staff,i was in san diego for a business trip and was not expecting much from the hotel i was pleasantly surprised by the hip downtown location as well as the overall appearance and history of the hotel i was greeted by a few very helpful young men at the valet station  one of which a young man named john who gregariously brought my luggage up to my room and told me he could give me a historical tour of the building it was a former bank and most of the interior is original its a historic landmark most notably the ceiling in the lobby is handpainted and immaculate there is also the original safe which was quite impressive i cant tell you all of the surprises  youll have to find john to take the tour  but its worth it the breakfast buffet was good too  with an omelet station a must for any business traveler with a long day ahead of them,4.0
perfect location fantastic guest services lovely rooms,this was my second stay at hotel rex i would highly recommend it for anyone traveling within san francisco the hotel is one block off of union square so it is quieter than the other hotels right on the square but still easily accessible to great shopping trolly cars etc the evening wine happy hour was a great way to meet new people and relax after a busy day,5.0
i would stay here again,few blocks from fulton subway station really clean safe place nice hot breakfast staff was excellent i read one review about the slow elevator and thought how bad could that be but it really was slow i definitely would stay there again,4.0
what a great stay,had a wonderful time staying at the w city center all the staff we met was soooo nice and helpful especially eden bernal she suggested places to visit while in chicago and was very helpful thank you eden we will be back as i have falling in luv with the beautiful city of chicago,5.0
great old hotel awesome location wonderful neighborhood vibe,"we traveled to dc for easter break we arrived on thursday before easter the lobby was crowded but the valet service was prompt and helped us unload our car with ease there was a line to checkin but it moved swiftly aside from a very annoying and rude customer in front of us who kept calling the omni representative evil amy our checkin went smoothly we were given room 715 which turned out to be lovely very spacious nice veranda with a view of the washington monument in the distance the room was clean and i would have rated it even higher for cleanliness but for the hotels failure to wash the windows  which were pretty bad we had no problems with the elevators or the crowds  the hotel complex is huge and there were a couple school tours staying there when we were but we were never inconvenienced the concierge desk was wonderful 
what we liked best was the hotels location one block from a metro stop  2 or 3 blocks from the national zoo also there is a nice little strip of restaurants shops drug stores etc right next to the hotel open city diner was wonderful and right across the street you couldnt ask for anything more convenient yes you are a ways away from the dc tourist sites but the metro can have you from the hotel to the smithsonian in 10 minutes  for a 130 no less the only time we had to take a cab was for easter services at the national cathedral we did not take any of our meals at the hotel except for grabbing coffee and danish at the cafe in the mornings on our way out to see the sites the hotel restaurants were very expensive  especially easter brunch i have to disagree with some of the previous correspondents who complained of the poor rooms they were given and the indifferent staff  our experience was to the contrary we had a wonderful stay and would certainly stay there again",4.0
unique and origional features great location and value,"when arriving at this hotel you are greeted by pleasant and helpful staff you then go up to your room in the old style of elevator and behind the origional features you discover a spacious clean and ample living space 
you are perfectly placed for all bars restaurants and bus and tram stops you will never struggle to find somewhere toeat or drink and you could do far worse tan to walk across the road and sample the numerous reasonably priced local beers
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would happily return with a change of mattress to a more comfortable version and a reduction in the cost of valet parking at the apartments then this would be a perfect place to stay",4.0
loved the roosevelt,"stayed at the roosevelt for my partners 40th birthday 
the staff we found were very helpfull and the location was brill all in all a good alrounder rooms are better than avg well cleaned and fresh bedding every day bathroom well stocked downstairs in the lobby theres the bar fairly priced for newyork and bar food not to pricy but cheaper can be found at grand cental they have tons of eaterires to chose from there all types catered forand only 5 mins away from times square and broadway
would stay here again",5.0
great location,"this is another great joie de vivre property the hotel was built in 1927 and has been nicely renovated the rooms are small as one expects in a building this age but very well appointed hotel staff was very friendly and customer service oriented as is the case with all joie de vivre hotels
excellent location a few blocks from union square easy walking distance to the embarcadero the opera house city hall etc onsite restaurant saha serves very interesting middle eastern cuisine even for breakfast service was a bit iffy but the staff were all brand new and very anxious to please
outstanding value for downtown san francisco we will definitely be back",5.0
a super value in a very clean hotel,we stayed in two rooms for five days while attending a convention the fiveblock walk to the convention center was a pleasure the downtown area was clean and safe plenty of restaurants and other sites to walk to we will go back to this placeit was really friendly and clean clean clean oh the beds were nice and firm,5.0
location is great but the hotel needs some work,i am writing this review as i am traveling back home to dallas from nyc the hotel is in a great location just a short walk from times square however the rooms need a few renovations most notably the bathroom showers elevators wallpaper and ac units the room we stayed in 1008 had an ac unit that made a loud rattling noise when on maintenance came and fixed it the first night we were there but the noise returned the next night and we had to temporarily move to another room for a night while they worked on it further also our in room mini bar did not work and that issue was never rectified lastly if you stay here i highly recommend that you request a room on a lower floor this way you can avoid the elevator and take the stairs the elevators are extremely slow and will only comfortably hold 4 normal size peoplealthough we experienced several rides with 6 people cramed in overall this hotel did not live up to my expectations for 340 a night the location is great but i would expect a better overall experience for the price,3.0
loved the distrikt,i got a special rate at distrikt so it was fairly cheap for manhatten its 2 or 3 blocks from times square not really our thing but might be for someone else there is easy access to the subway station at the 42nd st stop there is also a liquor store and late night pizza joint within a very short walking distance the doormen at the hotel are very friendly they will carry bags flag down taxis and anything you need with a smile anthony at the bar is a great bartender he got us in the skyclub at no cost when we got our hotel we asked for a room with a view and quiet we were on the 29th floor so we heard no street traffic the elevators are very fast never had to wait on them the lobby and common areas are very clean the apple computers are free to use and there was always one available to print flight stuff our room had a view of the empire state building the room was small but arent they all in nyc but the amenities were fabulous the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice free wifi nice flatscreen tv we called the front desk for a wine bottle bucket and razors they were at the door in 5 minutes i would definately stay here again,5.0
good place but find parking elsewhere,"girlfriend and i decided to make a spurofthemoment weekend trip to boston this was the hotel we happened to get through a website that allows you to name your own price
the hotel itself was great the facilities are newly renovated and everything was clean checkin and checkout were a breeze even though it wasnt right in the heart of downtown the t red line subway was just a short walk away theres free wireless internet in every room and a business center allows you to surf the web and print things out for free this was a godsend since we didnt really do a lot of preplanning for the trip we were able to plot out places we wanted to see and print the necessary google maps and look up stuff like hours admission fees and so forth
i had only two minor complaints and one major complaint minor complaint 1  for being such a ritzylooking hotel i was surprised to learn the pool is outdoors and therefore seasonal seems like a hotel that would have an indoor pool minor complaint 2  the windows arent very energyefficient we had to crank up the heat to 75 degrees in order to make up for the coldness near the windows
only major complaint about this place is that they dont own their own parking facilities valets are available to take your car to a nearby private lot which is a jawdropping 36 a day as nice as this hotel is its still not the ritz carlton who ever expects to pay for parking at a holiday inn ive never been to a hotel where you pay for parking even at better chains like the radisson or even at disney world
thanks to tripadvisor i was warned this parking fee by checking the hotels amenity listing but there werent really any reviews to point it out so i wanted to draw attention to it
if youre flying into town and not planning to leave boston at all ie dont need to rent a car i suggest taking the t from the airport to the hotel its very easy to get around the city if you have an unlimited pass to ride the t or if you dont mind walking take the airport shuttle to south station then get the red line to charlesmgh yes if youre looking at google the blue line bowdoin station is just as close as the red line but the blue line doesnt stop there on weekends
even if youre driving in like we did find an outlying t station and ride the train in usually the stops at the end of the line have the largest parking facilities in this case we parked at alewife the station at the western end of the red line it was just a short 6stop ride to charlesmgh the stop closest to this hotel and the parking was just 5 a day so instead of paying 72 for 2 days of parking we paid just 10 not to mention you get to avoid driving in the heavy hectic city traffic
when you buy a t pass i suggest the 7day pass even if youre only there for a weekend its cheaper than buying two 1day passes unlimited rides on any subway or bus which makes it easy to jump around town without constantly wondering if youve got the right change for fare the t is pretty clean though some of the stations are in the midst of muchneeded renovatons we had no problems with it even at night
of course if youve got a big family and lots of luggage taking the t might not be so convenient even for a family of 4 taking the car in and out everywhere might be cheaper than getting 7day t passes for everyone",3.0
above and beyond,i stayed at the orchard hotel with a friend for a getaway weekend in the city we were greated by kind and genuine employees from the front door to the front desk shortly after arrival i received a call from the front desk that my car wouldnt start and couldnt be moved to valet parking several of the staff came out and we all tried to figure out what was wrong this was of course well after closing of repair shops but they helped us find numbers for aaa and for a local dealer and made what could have been a crummy situation as easy as possible i feel that they went above and beyond the call of duty and can say that the rooms and amenities in the rooms were in line with this assessment as well good size rooms for the city and very comfy beds and the bathroom is bigger than the one in my home so i will absolutely stay there again,5.0
good hotel to see the sights with a young family,"we choose this hotel based on its central location and of course it being part of the marriott family we have a two and half year old that we wanted to take to the washington monument so location was key 
once we arrived we were greeted by the parking manager who got the car checked in 44 per dayinout privilege and a bellman promptly unloaded the car and got us on our way checkin was quick and efficient by a friendly gentleman the hotel features smart elevators that cuts your elevator wait time in half which is nice
upon arrival to the room we were delighted to see that we had a view of 14th street and not the courtyard i had forgotten to inquire at the front desk about this from the 10th floor we also had a nice view of the washington monument our main reason for the visit we found the room to be exceptionally clean and reasonably spacious for a dc hotel the corner window was a neat touch that a lot of the rooms had the bed linens were of high quality and very comfortable we had also requested a rollaway and it was placed in our room while were away it was much nicer than normal which was nice
we checked out the pool as well and found it to be acceptable the high speed internet is not free in the rooms but free in the lobby we did not use it throughout our stay
overall the hotel is well located and in good condition i thought the service was great from start to finish the best part was the location it was close to the national mall and smithsonian although pricey i felt it was worth being close to these areas as we had the two and half year old and couldnt walk around for long periods of time i would highly recommend",5.0
good location  good roombut,"we have stayed here for four days first i thought this hotel is great
nice location that be overlooked the wtc memorial park 
and nice room that has enought space to open 2 104l suitcases and 2 50l backpacks
there is a fridge  range and two tv the room design is modern 
i thought this hotel is great but second daywe came back after sightseeing
i surprised our room didnt finish to clean up 
only bed making and amenity change was finished
used towels were still there one room was not cleaned
i didnt know why  we didnt leave a message or didnt put the card not to clean on
immediately i said it and brought us some towels
so next day  we came back my room didnt finish to clean up too
the day  the carpet wasnt cleaned up i disappointed at the hotel",2.0

oh dear this is an apology for a radisson,having used radisson hotels in the past we thought we couldnt go too far wrong we arrived in the early hours very tired and looking for a room and were advised by the night staff that they had just had a cancellation despite the fact it was 0130 in the morning the reservation assistant was adamant that he could not include breakfast or reduce the rate we were also advised that we would have to pay a 22 valet parking charge after some negotiation and dismay with this and the room rates we were given a very small discount how i wish we had found another hotel we approached our room to find dirty glasses and coffee cups lying in the corridor outside and it went downhill from there inside the room we found a half consumed meal and bottle of water in the fridge biscuit crumbs on the chair and table and a sticky pest control device underneath one of the beds far from there being a cancelation it was clear that the room had recently been used and not been serviced only one coffee cup and water cup remained there was no laundry bag no glasses or cups in the bathroom and the beds had not been made up properly these were the almost forgiveable aspects of the airport radisson the completely unforgiveable centred around the grey and stained net curtains the stained bed linen the cracked sink the wallpaper peeling off the wall and the socket hanging out the wall the room was shabby and tired with old fashioned furnishings cathode ray tv and was certainly not what i would expect for nearly 300 added to this is the audacity to charge 22 or parking and the valet parking service provided by individuals who openly tout for tips unfortunately having travelled far with a half asleep eight year old we were far too tired to take issue with the room that evening we raised our disappointment the following morning with the reservation manager gandy who was clearly dismayed at the situation and offered an immediate reduction we appreciate your efforts gandy but this radisson hotel needs to address the fundamentals of hotel value and service provision i have no doubt that our room had been double let having probably been used for a day let or airline crew and to then charge nearly 300 for an unserviced room is unacceptable however what is also unacceptable is the standard of rooms being provided at premium rates this hotel has obviously seen better days and needs a substantial refurbishment but there appears little incentive so long as there is a lucrative airport traveller catchment market dont be fooled by the grand entrance and valetconcierge desks  if you have the choice do yourself a favour and find somewhere else to stay,1.0
good location good price for sf accomodation,"we stayed at the town house back in may 2012 for 3 nights
our first thought was omg mainly because the chap at the lobby was a bit grumpy once we were given the room we were very impressed with the size and overall state of the room
the best thing i found is the hotel location for the price we paid us 26700 for 3nights specially if you are at sf as tourist
the fishermans wharf is at walking distance 15 min we did it many times and also the crooked street is at walking distance if you wish to walk if we didnt do 
you have the hop onhop off double decker bus stop across the road and a few stores where you can few things you might need 
union street its quite close too and there are plenty options to have breakfast and dinners i recommend you spend some time there for breakfastnice cafes
the cons for me were
 the air spray used by the cleaning lady was too smelly i know this might sound a bit a silly but for me it was definetely a minus
 the noise at nightas other people has appointed it gets better if you close the windows but you can still hear it
overall i recommend to stay here if you are on a budget",4.0
the staff at sls helped me feel right at home,during my 2 day and 2 night first stay and definitely not last  the staff made me feel right at home thank you to lisa both jasons tessa fredo wyatt bari sp natasha and the whole breakfast staff for going above and beyondapologies to those whos names ive forgotten,4.0
decent if not terribly interesting,i traveled here for a conference and was mostly satisfied with the experience all the staff at the hotel were very accommodating and helpful rooms were clean and neat i liked the use of stone as part of the decor since limestone is famous in austin there was nothing terribly interesting about the hotel itself but thats not bad nofrills competence works on a business trip i did wish the elevators were not quite so congested during peak times i lived on the 20th floor and sometimes had to wait close to 5 minutes for an elevator and then had to stop at every floor as it picked up people they should make separate elevator banks devoted to different floors austin as a city is incredible well worth the visit,4.0
great location fine hotel,"we stayed here with my parents and our young baby and it was all fine the location is great  just behind the air and space museum which we love
the hotel itself is pretty average but if you get a good deal on hotwire its great value for money considering youre within walking distance from almost every main attraction in the area 
the breakfast buffett and room service were good  not too expensive for what it was 
all in all we were happy to have stayed here and would hope to again if were ever in the dc area again",4.0
the adolphus is a treasure,great size rooms  we had a suite and it was perfect for 4 people the atmosphere is very elegant and the service was great we have stayed at the adolphus in the past and once again it was a great experience the french room is wonderful and they make you feel special,5.0
great location for shopping,"very nice hotel right in the middle of all the shops in downtown san francisco hotel is also right next to the cable car stop so its easy to get about the city
room had modern style duvet cover and was clean and tidy with a tv and coffee making facilities whilst the hotel was not luxury it was certainly more than adequate for myself and my boyfriend as we did not spend much time in there ok the view from the room onto an interior courtyard was not great but it really didnt bother me there are also free internet facilities at the hotel which was a bonus
i think if i stayed in san fran again i would stay in a hotel in north beach just because it was nearer the nicer restaurants little italy that we visited each night but union square was very good and literally right in the middle of the shops its just that there was not very many places to eat around there apart from burger king etc felt perfectly safe returning to the hotel at night though as the area was busy with lots of people
visit to alcatraz is a must but be warned san francisco is actually quite chilly even in summer and especially in the evenings  i think due to the fog the city gets so definitely take your jeans and a proper warm coat",3.0
very good but not quite great,"the good great location by independence park and in olde city very good service nice bedding and furniture terrific highend ambience jazz trio at the bar in the evening omni kids program nice 42 wallmounted flat panel in renovated room
the bad pool was being renovated could hear unmuffled noise thru room door and adjoining room door unrenovated room vehicle got a few dings from the tight parking garage next door used for valet parking",4.0
thewittrendy different,"i stayed at thewit for three nights my husband was in chicago on business and had been there a week i was iffy as to whether i wanted to make the drive from ohio but after i read the reviews i wanted to see the hotel 
the valet were very fast and friendly parking was 5000 a day but there was in and out privileges so i thought it was worth it i cant imagine finding anything much cheaper
i didnt check in at the desk since my husband was already there so i missed out on the cookie everyone is talking about in their reviews the hotel lobby was very modern clean noisy and small not a relaxing lobby like some hotels
from thewit you can walk to millennium park navy pier michigan avenue art museums and theaters there is a radio and tv station across the street so you can watch and listen to the news unfold if you like there is shopping the next several blocks that is great there is also the train loop right out the front door great for getting around but very noisy and dirty
i thought the room was fineaverage we didnt have a corner room with large windows etc the view was an office building across the street 
the room had a nice desk and chair for work purposes but the internet was expensive there were three tiers of service offered for internet and i think the cheapest was over 1100 a day i did use the business center once and it was very nice but also expensive to print for some reason our cell phone service was terrible in the room the beds were comfortable not bad but not great
the bathroom was clean and large the sink was different as some have stated on here not something i would want at home but cool for the weekend the door to the bathroom was a large sliding door that didnt close all the way and was really heavy and hard to handle it was weird
housekeeping was fine they cleaned the room daily in the evenings when they did turndown service they left little witty cards with different toys to go with them we got a frisbee and several other items cute idea
i didnt hear crickets or other noises that people have talked about in the halls
in the evenings it was crazy you had to show your room key to get into the lobby there was a guard at the front door people were lined up outside for the entrance to the rooftop bar and guests were lined up inside an elevator was dedicated to the bar and roped off it made the small lobby even crazier and louder elevator service was slower the elevators have a security measure where you need to use your key to access the guest floors but some guests dont get the concept so it was even crazier and slower
i had breakfast in the restaurant the hostess was very attentive to the guests needs and happy to be sure you were taken care of quickly i thought the food was fine i loved their yogurt parfait not cheap but what is these days
so all in all i thought thewit was fine clean friendly staff but i would probably stay somewhere else next time it wasnt my cup of tea if i want the noise and crazy i go to vegas",4.0
should probably have a tetanus shot,this place is gross i was there for a convention and heard over and over from the participants what a dump it is the lobby area is nice and meeting rooms are ok and the beds are comfortable to be fair it appears that they tried to update the rooms but painting over a hole in the wall doesnt cover up the fact that theres a hole in the wall im not a germophobe by any stretch of the imagination but i wouldnt walk barefoot on the carpet the hallways especially in the nontower parts of the building stink horribly the final straw for me was after dragging my luggage through several doors and down carpeted hallways i actually had to carry it down some stairs because there wasnt an elevator handy in the process of trying to do this my calf rubbed against the stair edge which had a sharp metal piece hanging off of it of course since i was wearing a dress it cut my leg and still more than a week later i have a scab from it there are much better places to stay in houston  id advise looking elsewhere and for petes sake dont book a convention here,2.0
experience at the carlyle,my family spent 9 nights at the carlyle in dc and enjoyed the service and hospitality the staff was very friendly and service oriented two of the staff jordan and david were especially helpful with restaurant recommendatiions and directions to different places in the dc area the rooms were well serviced and clean the hotel is located in an area surrounded by restaurants cafes and grocery stores in the historic dupont circle section most of the essentials were within walking distance of the hotel,4.0
what a dump please read my review,i was not expecting a palace but this place was a disgrace typically hotel rooms are no big deal to me because i merely sleep there however i believe as a hotel it should be condemned it had a filthy carpet stained walls broken night lamp broken oldfashioned tv flea market furniture no ac or fan small and few towels dangerous uncovered steam radiator dim lighting lumpy bed very weak shower pressure and the walls were painted different colors how they do business is beyond me there are better hotels for the same money it is so awful i intend to contact the ny dept of consumer affairs save time money and stress stay anywhere else,1.0
good value close to downtown,"located close to town the approach is bit disorienting as you pass by a abandoned building the hotel looks pretty much used but our queen bed room was fine and clean
our room was on the 5th floor the shared balcony that run all around the building offers a nice view at the mississippi river service is really minimal but you get what you pay for",3.0
always a pleasure,we stayed here last week for my birthday the front desk upgraded me to a bigger room without me asking the parking is very reasonable and safe at 1600 a night you are in the perfect location to walk to the filmore polk russian hill and some of the most beautiful parts of sf japan town is such a wonderful place to explore there are so many shops and delicious places to eat i am always more than happy to stay at hotel kabuki the rooms are stunning and the service is outstanding how can you beat the amazingly romantic views from your window this is the place i most like to stay when im in san francisco,5.0
great location  affordable price,why pay more when youre only in the room for about 10 hours a day,4.0
great hotel with a lot of personality,hotel is on the san antonio riverwalk the rooms opening up to the courtyard are great fabulous bar and the hotel staff is very welcoming and friendly this is not the typical marriotts or hiltons but has a huge personality which make you feel at home fits the name as the hotel is designed to give you the feel of a spanish villa it has nice restaurants around it i will recommend visiting acenar restaurante and the esquire tavern huge thumbs up,5.0
stylish modern hotel in fantastic location,"the hotel has a fantastic location right near the white house and only 3 blocks  5 mins walk from the metro centre tube station this made the city easy to explore
the room we had was very spacious clean and modern
the hotel was very busy on friday  saturday night with a party atmosphere the rooftop bar is definately worth a visit for the views and to watch the sunset but got quite chilly so wrap up warm
there are not that many restaurants in the immediate area and the ones about were very busy so we would recommend booking a table
we found the staff very helpful and would stay again if we were to return to washington",5.0
go there to eat and drink but be careful of the rooms,"i had a relatively enjoyable stay at the palmer house i will say that the concierge and bell staff is absolutely exceptional for example i had a question about parking and asked the bell man he was unable to answer me but then later sought me out to give me an answer that is above and beyond service and is definetely appreciated 
i have stayed at the palmer house several times the first time i had the lovely accomodations which included two bathrooms and absolutely fabulous fixtures and finishes the second time i was put into a room where the wall paper was falling off the wall the fixtures were rusted and the tile in the bathroom was moldy i literally threw a fit and was granted a free voucher for my next stay that brings me to my most recent stay i was once again put into a notverynice room with rusty fixtures a dirty bathroom and scratched furniture since it was free i was okay with it but thank goodness i was only staying one night i travel quite a bit and i will tell you that ive stayed in nicer hotels in the middle of nowhere wisconsin for example the americinn 
the lobby of the palmer house is outstanding the vibe is wonderful the restoration is beautifully done the food and drink is delicious my recommendation is that the hilton people find a way to improve their dumpy rooms asap i will continue to recommend the palmer house for a drink and dinner but will advise all travelers to be sure to specify one of the suite rooms green decor if they choose to stay there otherwise you are better off at one of the other fabulous hotels that chicago has to offer in its downtown",2.0
great place to stay,"stayed at the sofitel for 2 weeks on business and enjoyed it completely rooms were sleek and modern and the bathroom was marble with both a shower and bath the bed was on the soft side but i found it terrific as i did the huge tv there are keurig coffee makers in the rooms plus complimentary bottled water and also coffeeteafruit in the lobby early 
the gym was respectable for a hotel gym and had a mix of cardio weight machines and dumbells one of the few drawbacks was the elevator  one needs to swipe ones key card to get to your floor but they often malfunctioned of course its a good security measure but could be annoying since i did not pay for the room i cannot judge if it was a good value
the rittenhouse square area was wonderful loved the park farmers market on saturdays and all the shops nearby marathon was a reliable favorite restaurant and trader joes is walking distance another tip the palomar hotel across the street had a happy hour from 1011pm",5.0
good location tiny hotel,"my husband and i stayed here for a surprise anniversary trip to nyc the location was great  close to a metro stop very near macys on 34th st and close to the empire state building the hotel is very small in general the lobby elevator hallways and rooms are almost miniature our room was clean enough but there wasnt room to relax the small window was blocked by an ac unit so there was almost no view of the street 
the bathroom had a stand up shower with no edge therefore the shower water would run onto the rest of the bathroom floor
the service at the hotel was very good the concierge was friendly and helpful on the early morning that we left it was pouring down rain the concierge hailed us a taxi and gave us an umbrella
while i did enjoy our stay in nyc this hotel was pricey and small if you dont plan on being in your room much i would recommend it otherwise go for something that has a little more space",3.0
wonderful anniversary trip,"my husband and i stayed here for our anniversary trip from april 16  19 2012 it was a wonderful experience beginning to end this was our 4th visit to the distrikt hotel new york city new york 
starting with the reservation process peter was so helpful in making sure the details of our stay were correct also i did a last minute followup email where kayte reconfirmed everything was ready for our stay their professionalism helped set the tone for our visit thank you
upon checking in at 245 pm will at the front desk was so helpful and professional making sure our room was ready for us with keys a complimentary continental breakfast coupon and a 20 coupon for food at the collage bistro in hand we took the elevator to the 30th floor to room 3001 it was a beautiful king room with a city and river view very quiet super clean there was a note from ms rota the general manager welcoming us with brownies a welcome note a distrikt tote bag and chocolates in a plastic container wow this was wonderful
we went out for a walk to the chelsea market and when we returned the turndown service had been completed along with two amazing chocolate cupcakes and a card from the staff welcoming us too plus chocolates and a weather card on the bed another wow
the room is beautifully appointed with fresh clean towels robe a wonderful coffee maker with coffee and tea thank you from an early riser and a great flat screen television our room was wonderfully kept by housekeeping and the turndown staff we appreciate that greatly
the breakfasts in the collage bistro were wonderful and the service from anthony and miguel was flawless a great way to start the day
peter again was so helpful with change a cheerful disposition welcoming and professional ana was wonderful and checking if we needed anything neesha was wonderful and helpful with the printing of our boarding passes 
upon check out rachel was wonderful super kind and professional joseph was great at hailing a cab for our return to jfk airport and loading our suitcases in the trunk of the cab
all the staff at the distrikt hotel are the best
ms jennifer rota the general manager should be commended for her management skill and leadership of her staff we are also so appreciative all of her help with our room selection the warm hospitality and gifts which made our anniversary celebration trip the best ever we will definitely return to the distrikt hotel in the very near future

perfect in everyway with the exception of checkout,this hotel is a great value for the money the location is great and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable and very spacious the checkin experience was exceptionalwe two couples traveling together were offered room upgrades suites for an additional 20per room and complimentary champagne upon arrival staff are extremely perhaps a little over the top friendly and very accomodating the only disappointment was at checkouti instructed the clerk to charge both rooms to one credit card but unfortunately our traveling companions were charged separately for her room this was a simple request that should have been honored,4.0
great rate wonderful stay and super staff,we stayed here for three nights in august we chose the hotel for the nightly rate seaport location and great parking rate we were happy with every part of our stay the hotel is in a perfect location to walk to the seaport  brooklyn bridge and battery park the subway is just down the street what was by far the best part of our stay was the wonderful hospitality by the staff every person we encountered in the hotel was so helpful and kind the front desk was so full of information and suggestions the night we arrived the gentelman working even offered us some yogurts to take to the room for our young children the rooms are large for nyc size and the doubles have 2 queen beds instead of 2 doubles as most hotels offer the day we checked out we were able to store our luggage in a storage room while we spent the day in the city the parking is 20 a day just across the street that is a fantastic rate we would stay here again in a heartbeat,5.0
i cant believe it,i was more than shocked upon arriving at the registration desk on saturday november 6 i had made my reservation three months in advance i had requested and was promised a room in the towers upon speaking to the clerk he said to me we do not have a room for you we are overbooked i replied you must be joking as i made my reservation over three months ago furthermore you have my email address and you never contacted me at any time telling me that you were overbooked you left me no option but to come to this desk and be told too bad we are sorry we have no rooms the fact that you offered me another hotel and would pay for it was of little consolation it was 6 miles away and all of my colleagues and meetings were at the marriott it is a sad day that a hotel chain that prides itself on friendliness and professionalism has fallen so far and perhaps so fast,1.0
ok location expensive parking dated rooms,"the hotel itself looks very nice including the lobby and restaurantbar our reservation included breakfast buffet which was delicious staff is very nice and helpful we got a refrigerator in our room upon request
the rooms are dated with worn down furniture the carpet under the bed visibly was never vacuumed and had a thick layer of dust the bed was comfortable but the linens didnt fit properly and kept sliding off the bathroom was clean 
the valet parking is the closest parking available within a few blocks and costs a a mind blowing 45 for one night",3.0
this time it was ok,i have stayed at this hotel quite a few times in the past year and it was pretty good until this sept 2009 the pizza guy knocked on our door at 11 pm at night when i had just gone to sleep then at 530 am i had taken a shower and washed my hair and when i used the hairdryer it made a funny noise and quit working and the noise from the hairdryer some how made the alarm go off in the room and it woke my son up the beds were hard this time and i had a hard time going to sleep the location is great for going to seaworld and right next door to shopping and the price well you get what you pay for  its nothing like the hyatt the people were friendly and helpful,3.0
funky hotel in central location,"whenever i book a hotel i always expect the worse so i was pleasantly surprised to see this place was nice clean large enough for two people for 5 days and has a bath tub the street people can keep you awake at night on the weekend but its ok during the week lucky there were heaters in the room to dry our clothes from all the rain 
pro central nice clean bathtub gym comfy beds
con littered noise im ok with and lift little slow again if this is my only problem then this is a great place",4.0
nice hotel terrible location,honestly the bums you hear about are dangerous they are not only homeless and in need of money they are mentally disturbed its a shame because the hotel was nice though the rooms were outdated old tv that did not work properly and the sirens keep you awake like most cities the walls were paper thin a group of people were walking past our room at 2am and i could swear it sounded like they were in our room it was that loud but i give them points for trying a few incidents occured we got abused for not giving the hundredth bum a quarter who in turn threatened violence crazy people hovering around the atm across the street one guy was groping people in inappropriate places its such a shame as this has nothing to do with the hotel but all he same i would not return,3.0
heater sounded like lawn mowerfriendly front desk staff,prior reviews complained the rooms are in a state of disrepair when you check in and first visit your room take nothing for granted check to ensure everything works properly dont wait until you are unpacked and half asleep before you decide its getting a bit chilly and you might want some heat because if you do this in room 1239 you might have a problem unless you can sleep five feet away from a sound that mirrors a running lawn mower the folks who run this hotel must read these reviews that means they must know things are in a state of disrepair despite this they continue to rent rooms to guests who mistakenly believe they will find everything in working order when they get assigned to a specific room the folks that run this hotel should be ashamed of themselves,2.0
extremely classy hotel with some drawbacks,"we were in town for a wedding for which the reception was across the street at the st francis and chose the kengington park becuase of its higher reviews and it seemed to be more dog friendly in fact it turned out to be probably the most dog friendly of many hotels where weve stayed with the little fella not in terms of amenities no dog bowels blankets etc but who really needs them but insofar as how the staff acted toward him which gives rise to the next highpointoutstanding service we decided we didnt need want full housekeeping service on the second day of our stay but did want the garbage emptied the staff was on the scene within two minutes of our request front desk staff politely greeted us by name upon entering and exiting 
the decor of the hotel is just as subtly classy as the service complimentary juice and coffee are served in the morning and sherry and tea in the afternoon some light snacks with the latternuts etc would be a nice touch room service is from a deli la taza two doors down and stops at 7 with what is basically a lunch menu we just went there and got take out for breakfast opt for the fruit rather than the burned potatoes to avoid the service charges theres another deli cafe encore two doors down thats open until 8 and has a broader selection of sandwiches and salads that can suffice for dinner but a less appealing breakfast menu the farallon a highly regarded restaurant is part of the hotel so its hard to understand why they dont have room service from it at least for dinner
the room was fine nice decor great tv comfortable beds but quite cramped for two people and a dog including a small bathroom the low speed internet access was adequate for our purposes higher speed connections are available for a fee the room was supposed to be one class up from the base it was about fifteen bucks more per night but in fact the only difference is youre on a higher floor with a view of nob hill or union square our view of the latter was the side of the new tower of the st francis there is a well functioning ceiling fan but no ac and the window lacked a screen it was in the low 70s the day we left and you could tell by 1130 that with the sun coming in through the window unless you drew the shades there was going to come a point when the room would get stuffy as a native northern californian i can attest it can and does get into the 80s several times a year in sf and even the 90s an handful of times i would suggest checking the 10 day forecast if planning to stay there any time from april through october and if theres a chance of such temps changing to a hotel with ac noise from post st was a real problem up to 130 am on sunday morning partiers literally screaming and many sirens i would imagine thats a problem anywhere you stay in the union sq area 
all in all a very positive experience at quite a reasonable price for that part of sf around 130 per night through the hotels web site booked over a month in advance",4.0
excellent service  perfect for business travel,the concierge was exceptionally helpful i needed some items at 630 am at my room and did not realize it until 11pm the night before everything was there at precisely 630am no fuss,5.0
ok for minimum time spent at hotel overall experience not great,i usually get annoyed when reviewers badmouth places and try to give the benefit of the doubt but i cant do that here spent 3 nights at this best western with my boyfriend usually best western is a solid name for quality but this place needs a little work the breakfast area was complete chaos each morning which could be corrected by extending the hours of the breakfast one hour since everyone was scrambling to get food by 9am which meant not much for selections the rooms are nice and i love the soapshampoolotion dispensers instead of the normal little bottles most hotels have beds were comfortable tv was nice but limited channels unless you know spanish 2 biggest annoyances i had  the toilet overflowed once and everytime you flushed it took several minutes to finish my boyfriend did not like how the room service came around at 8am and knocked on the door 3 times within a half an hour we were awake but it certainly was not relaxing or romantic the ice machine was outside our door not in a separate hall or room and people seemed to need ice at 5am kind of noisy,2.0
not worth the hype,my stay at the willard may have been unique since the other reviews have been glowing i went with two friends and we were dressed in jeans and sneakers the staff treated us horribly the doormen wouldnt help with the doors or your lugguage and the concierge was very rude our room was nice but not 450 worth i expected the willard to deliver the service you would receive at the four seasons but that was not the case the location was great and the lobby was beautiful but in the evenings the lobby turns into a smoking room and you can barely breathe as you walk through the lobby to the elevators i personally would never stay here again and save the few cents and stay down the street,2.0
definitely not luxurious,"i arrived at the hotel at 245 pm to check in and had to wait about 10 minutes for my room ok 10 minutes no big deal the lobby was nice enough the lounge was relaxing and the front desk staff was friendly i got my room key dropped my bags and left to go shopping i came back around 7 pm that night only to find that i had no hot water among other probelems for a luxury boutique hotel i was truly disappointed 
the rooms had been redone but they forgot the bathrooms the fixtures are outdated think 1970s there were burn marks on the orange countertop and there was a significant black and rust stain in the tub not to mention there was hardly any water pressure the rickety cheap metal closet doors dont open and close properly if the safe door is open the walls were so thin i could hear the phone ring and the subsequent conversation in the room next door i could also hear the people above me walking around all night i called the front desk who immediately sent people up to try to fix the problems housekeeping told me there was nothing they could do about the stain the safety lock was also loose the maintenance man told me i would have to wait at least a night or two before he could fix and as the housekeeper left the entire thing came off in my hands she just looked at me and shrugged 
the pool is a joke ive seen tubs bigger than that the restaurant is ok the free breakfast is basically fruit and yogurt if you want eggs bacon or toast you have to order it all in all i will never go back or recommend this place to anyone if you want something in the area try the parc suites its much better",2.0
excellent service and accommodations in a small footprint,"staying in a downtown boston hotel was an interesting firsttime experience for us seeing as we lived for 25 years less than a mile away from the back bay hilton and still consider ourselves locals this property is perfectly located in close proximity to many of bostons cultural dining and shopping venues and was for us a perfect home away from home
commercial property available for new hotel construction has been virtually nonexistent in bostons congested downtown and back bay areas for decades this would explain why the hilton a relatively recent arrival to the boston hotel scene is appreciably smaller than for example the much larger and older sheraton directly across the street which has the advantages and disadvantages of being integrated into the hynes convention center and prudential center complexes the hilton on the other hand has a very small triangular footprint on a tiny lot and is only 26 stories tall this gives it the unexpected and highly welcome ambience of a europeanstyle boutique hotel rather than a bigcity american commercial property
the feel of a boutique hotel was reinforced by the front desk staff housekeeping staff and other lobby service personnel who were all extremely friendly efficient helpful and solicitous almost to a fault we were greeted by one or more staff members each time we passed through the lobby this level of personalized service is quite remarkable even by high hilton corporate standards and especially so for this city bostonians in general have a wellearned reputation for being rather unfriendly and xenophobic the thought idly occurred to me that perhaps all of the hiltons staff had been recruited from nonnatives imported from elsewhere
the room rates and parking fees are rather steep as is normal for bigcity hotels the adjacent parking garage was wellmaintained and convenient to the lobby as hilton gold members we were given a free upgrade to a corner room which is somewhat larger asymmetrical and appreciably less claustrophobic than the standard rectilinear rooms our room seemed to have been recently rehabbed and was nicely decorated and wellequipped including a large flat screen hdtv with a generous assortment of digital channels
the free breakfast served in the executive lounge was somewhat more limited in selection but far higher in quality and freshness than the standard breakfast fare served in hampton inns and hilton garden inns in the hilton family  in fact it was much better than the restaurants in most hilton hotels as well we plan to give their adjacent 40 dalton restaurant which shares a common kitchen a try on our next stay all in all this was one of the most satisfying and rewarding hilton experiences we have had in recent years to find this extremely high level of guest accommodations and service in our former home city was as astonishing as it was unexpected",5.0
a big ole cockroach on the 15th floor,i stayed at the w on lexington last night and actually got used to the small rooms they reminded me of europe rooms and although theyre a bit too modern for my taste i prefer the westin it was still fine this morning after my shower i was greeted by the largest cockroach ive ever seen and i lived in south florida for 4 years as it scurried right past my feet in the bathroom i ran into the bedroom to pull my suitcase off the floor and onto the bed so he wouldnt climb in and figured the bug had run into a corner and wouldnt be back well about 5 minutes later the same cockroach comes running toward me in the bathroom again i managed to flip the opaque trash bucket on top of the roach i finished getting ready and when i mentioned the incident to the front desk and how it was still there under the trash bucket all i received was an im sorryno explanation nothing needless to say even though my work is keeping me in the city another night i went a block and checked into the doubletree it was a much lower rate even as a walkin and the rooms are more comfortable and the staff so far is very friendly,2.0
fabulous hotel  will stay again,we traveled with 2 other families to nyc and stayed in affinia dumont got a great deal from priceline the manager gave us upgrades from the studio to 2 queen bed rooms this hotel was great for our large group and for the kids excellent location very friendly and helpful staff huge roomsuite for nyc walking distance to the subway macys bryant park dunkin donuts is right outside the hotel grocery store and fruit vendors are nearby would definitely stay here again,5.0
exceeded expectations,"i stayed here for five nights while on a business trip this is a phenomenal hotel and the rate i paid was below many of the surrounding properties it is in a fantastic location right near the financial district but also close to union square and all lines of public transportation i also walked to north beach in around 15 minutes
the employees were all extremely helpful and the decor was adorable you cannot miss the wine reception 
as other posters have noted there can be some street noise in the wee hours but it did not disrupt my sleep also some of the restaurants in the very near vicinity were not open on weekends
i would stay here again in a heartbeat",5.0
hotel georgethe hotel youll want to pack up and take with you,"my son and i went to washington dc this past week i had not been there in several years i searched trip advisor and other places to find the best hotel that was within my budget after reading several very good reviews and then seeing the room rate on expedia almost half of the what other hotels were charging i thought something isnt right here i continued to go back and forth but then finally pushed the button and booked the room initially my son was not going with me on this trip it was a few weeks later when he decided to join me so i contacted the hotel to see if i could get a rollaaway bed in the room i received the nicest email back from patrick donovan hotel georges asst front office manager who took care of that for me and then later sent another email that they had an opening in a better room and moved me there at no extra charge to me very nice
upon my arrival the hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating it gave me the feeling that i was among friends already this trip was off to a great start
when we walked into our room we were not only thrilled with the spacious luxury that it offered but were so moved by the thoughtfulness of the staff
they knew this was alexs first trip to dc i mentioned in an email so there were passes to museums maps and a lot of information about the city especially for us on the desk also a couple of gifts that they specifically chose with alexs age and new driver status in mind outstanding
we had not eaten for some time at that point and couldnt believe our eyesthere were wonderful treats on the desk for us as well
fruit and cheese plate hotel george
this was a first for me and the many hotels ive stayed in around the country travel several times per year and usually stay in expedia rated 3 and 4 star hotels 5 being highest based on room rates services offered etc a very nice note from jasmine ward guest services agent for the hotel accompanied the gifts and food we also received a call from the front desk checking to see if the room was suitable and if we needed anything else wow i told alex id like to pack this hotel and take it with us
the bathroom was simply beautiful it had marble tile flooring a stand alone shower and the bath tub had the handles on the side which was a nice touch the vanity had my favorite featurethe makeup mirror with magnifier  awesome lots of little extras too the shower also had its own set of shower gel shampoo and conditioner no messing with little bottles and such 
i felt a woman must have designed the bathroomwell done
the bed was heavenly so soft with its pillow top mattress and quality bedding the pillows were perfect for the support i need for my neck yet so soft too
the locationthis is where i thought the other shoe would finally dropit didnt because the room rate was so much more reasonable than other hotels with similar ratings  very high i kept thinking there was a catch
there wasnt
it is within walking distance of the capitol and the supreme court as well as many other landmarks we walked a lot and i can tell you that the area also was very safe we walked to chinatown and back our first night there no problems just need to be alert there were a lot of people around too friday night i had to spend the rest of the evening going over my notes on a presentation i was to make the next day and had plenty of time to do so after our walk around the area upon our return the doorman greeted us again by name
also special note to runners  they have a running map in the room another nice feature being a smaller hotel  once you leave your room you can be outside in about 2 minutes
service and staff  as i said before nothing compares to this stay and hotel 
the staff make or break a hotel
it can have all the best amenities but if coupled with poor customer service most guests wont go back also i have to add it wasnt just the arrival and such that the hotel george staff were so thoughtful friendly and helpful it was through out my entire stay i met up in dc with a larger group 12 of us and we had a tight schedule locating family friendly restaurants in dc that have entres under 10 and can accommodate our group on short notice was a bit of a trick on sunday night  930 we were looking for a restaurant like i described we had just finished up with our last function and had not had time to eat since noon we drove up to the hotel and the gentleman behind the desk quickly made a recommendation placed the call and made reservations for our group that were waiting in their cars out front the group was really happy with the restaurant too clydes
there were many other instances where staff went over and above  doing so like it was their standard mode of operation
our last night followed a very long and tiring day i needed to print out boarding passes for flight home i put it off as long as i couldnot having the energy to get up and go find the business center finally i called to ask where to go in hotel for such michael love the hotel george front office manager again almost read my mind he offered to take care of this for me and just slide the passes under my door another first usually if bringing something to the room its another interchange that requires among other things another tip i really appreciated michaels help  he was placing them as he said under the door  within minutes michael love also wrote us the nicest note thanking us for our stay with them and included a gift certificate too wow the hotel that keeps on giving more from the allstar staff  awesome
from the doorman to the guest and front office housekeeping staff etc everyone was more than accommodating setting a high bar for hotel customer service
lobby  beautifully appointed with grand piano tasteful yet comfortable furniture there are two very large windows they span from floor to ceiling so if you are waiting on people as i was its perfect to sit have some lemon water or hot chocolate also they have a wine reception in the late afternoon complementary i wasnt able to make that but would have if i would have been around the hotel at that time i didnt snap a picture of the lobby but it looked just like this that i plucked from dcluxuryhotelscom the black chairs were very comfortable
the restaurant bistro bis  alex and i had lunch there on sunday it has great atmosphere we ordered 2 hamburgers medium well they were good
the last morning before we departed i went in to the restaurant to get change the staff there that morning were wonderful very nice  even made me a cup of coffee to go and were very gracious and warm the coffee was great too

use your money to stay elsewhere,"i went to boston on vacation to see the city the hotel is not in the downtown area you have to walk though a construction area under the freeway to the subway i didnt stay out after dark there is no store not even a 7 11 or any type of restaurant within walking distance the cafe on premises is not a cafe its place to get something to eat to keep from starving the hotel is very noisy children running and slamming doors which shakes the building it is not worth the money at all i was there for 4 nights i would have moved but upon check in they give you a contract that entitles them to charge a penalty if you check out early i booked this hotel throught hilton i was very disappointed
the one good thing they asked their shuttle driver to drop me and pick me up at a restaurant on their way to the airport",2.0
elegant and romantic,"if you prefer minimalist ultramodern décor then this is probably not the place for you the waldorf is all about old world charm  big sweeping chandeliers lovely art deco1920s style rooms the bathrooms arent super modern but bright and airy with highquality fittings and scrupulously clean a huge bath tub if like me you like a good soak
we stayed in a suite which was really luxurious  roomy with lots of period furniture and helpful staff on hand whenever required really tranquil and relaxing i found the waldorf the ideal place to catch my breath after the bustle of the city id go back there in a heartbeat",5.0

one of my favorite hotels in nyc,i discovered the lucerne hotel many years ago and try whenever possible to stay there the rooms are spacious and comfortable the concierge is always amazingly helpful the restaurant next door is just fine and the location is perfect near central park and just off broadway the only problem with the hotel is that a lot of other visitors have discovered the lucerne as well and i have found it very hard to find a room when i need one so ive had to venture out to other hotels which have mostly been disappointing by comparison also as the hotels popularity has risen prices have escalated alas,5.0
business trip sparkling new modern 21st century hotel,"im a business traveler looking for specific things very cleanquiet and modern excellentquiet airconheat system that is user controlled good wifi connection good tvreception no bedbugs proximity to major subway lines
i dont care about room size light or views
pros brand new sparkling clean excellent king bed wifi has strong connection great tv reception attentive maid service better than average size nyc room a real 21st century room with power outlets everywhere excellent use of space in a small area great desk plenty of taskroomlighting plenty of natural light although it doesnt matter to me staff are very nice and cooperative but they need to keep some bathroom amenities close at hand rather than relying on housekeeping to supply later at night for a business traveler on a budget like me this gives me plenty of comfort for the money major subway lines at either 34thherald square 3 mins walk or just east of penn station 2 long ny blocks 6 mins walk
cons this stretch of 31st street is pretty meh not creepy or dangerous but guests need to be willing to walk a couple of blocks in either direction to find restaurants etc
neighborhood dunkin donuts is at the corner of 31st and 5th plenty of good dining options but dont expect the street itself to wow youit wont the hotel is a gorgeous modern building surrounded by well buildings not as nice close walking distance to hip eateries like the john dory oyster bar down bway 4 or 5 blocks on 5th theres a very hipmod kyo chon korean place great value cool vibe further up on 5th36th pret a manger which stays open till 10pm for light fare 31st east a couple of blocks things get better for dining

great service location,i have stayed in marriott locations in many states and i think i have found my favorite this hotel is a beautifully restored old bank building everyone we encountered from the front desk to the valet to the bellmen to the bartenders at happy hour treated us like royalty arnecia and her boss who we chatted with during the really great food and drink specials at happy hour at the bar made us feel like old friends visiting we even got a hug during our last day they also made some great restaurant recommendations we got a tour of the building from danny the bellman who went out of his way during a very busy day to take us around and discuss the history and renovations of the building he even has some great ghost stories if you like to be spooked i was also impressed when i walked by one of the maids on my way to our room and she asked me if i needed anything service here was really impressive it is in a great location close to the gas lamp district i would definitely stay here again when visiting the san diego area one tip if you are looking for brochures discounts or other info about attractions in the area ask at the front desk as they keep them locked up,5.0
loved this place and will return many many more times,"you do get what you pay for and yes this place can get expensive during peak times however this place truly showed its worth to us we came here for the first time in may for our daughters 2nd birthday we wanted a beach vacation and i found this place while searching hotels near sea world i instantly thought how it reminded me of our trip to hawaii and how perfect this place would be being right on the bay and with a room feet away from the sand it did not disappoint for a second the pools were great the bike rentals on sight the restaurants quick room service other activities ducks and fish all around the property but most importantly the fire pit on the beach 10 feet from our door and water another 10 feet this place provided such a wonderful time for us and our 2 year old that it quickly became one of the best places we have ever visited and we travel extensively 
as a side note we wanted to come back to san diego the next month for a quick getaway and this place was a little too pricey being that it was june i found the hilton across the street almost and thought it was similar in features we had such a terrible experience there that we checked out the next morning and i called paradise point we were upgraded all the way to the presidential suite and they saved our vacation which had so been nearly ruined by the hilton i can not say enough about this place and with all that they have done for us and how we were treated both times this is my favorite place to stay in san diego and should not be missed we are going back in september my only mistake in june was not going with paradise point to begin with dont second guess this place find a good rate go with aaa or destination delivers or call them but choose this place for a real great vacation",5.0

well worth the money,my husband and i just returned from a 4 night stay at the salisbury it was our first trip to nyc and i had found this little gem on this site we had read the reviews and figured for the price and location we would give it a chance i am so glad we did the staff was very friendly the room was huge with a kithenette and king sized bed we were minutes from central park and times square we didnt use the subway much instead opted to walk alot and also bought a 3 day tour bus pass the hop on hop off type so woth the money and it stopped minutes from the hotel door i would definately stay here again and will recommend it to anyone i know,5.0

 must be close to the venue

you can do better,"the hotel was clean and the grounds were well kept the front desk was efficient and despite a large crowed who arrived just ahead of us it only took a few minutes to check in 
the room is fairly large about the size of two standard rooms but everything was as cheap as you can get the carpet towels cabinets and bedding were of the lowest standards the bed was like sleeping on a giant slice of stale bread 
my wife and i went to austin to see the round rock express they won it is about a twenty minute drive to round rock from the hotel and the route is a little hard to follow with all of the construction the location is not very convenient to anything though the area is nice enough
while we thought the hotel was okay for the money we paid the next time we are going to find a place a little more comfortable",2.0
new favorite place,the building we stayed in was newly renovated and was immaculate the beds are the kind that you can adjust the firmness great the window covering was full length sliding 3 panels shutters you could still get light in and have privacy plus you could adjust the amount of light you got just like at home okay so the view was great there was a small play area across the street for kids swings and their was a pier to fish off of and some beach to have a fire you could see downtown san diego across the bay very easily since there were no clouds to be found everyone was friendly then there was the marinabeautiful i would love to retire here with my husband and just enjoy life,5.0

typical ridiculously priced average nyc hotel,lives off of its glorious past rooms are fine but nothing special food is at best average and the prices are typical nyc absurd my wife and i had lunch in their lobby restaurant for 140 which constituted two caesar salads with average quality seared tuna not cooked according to request two iced teas some fruit for dessert and two cappuccinos if not for my business expense account i would never walk in this hotel ultimately its nothing more today than an overpriced nyc hilton with a glorious past,3.0
nice property good location good value,"we chose this property for its proximity to the beach and because it looked a little funky we were pleased with what we discovered here
situated at the southern end of venice beach the inn is located near a lot of restaurant choices and away from the craziness of the ocean front walk 
the rooms we booked several different rooms due to group size were nicely appointed with seemingly newer furniture and the bathrooms were furnished with good quality toiletries
the continental breakfast was also sufficient to meet our needs to begin the day
the front desk staff is friendly very helpful and wellversed in area attractions restaurants and points of interest 
well be staying here when we visit the area again",4.0

better than i expected,the rooms open to the outside in a typical motel like setting so needless to say i did not expect much but i must admit that i was pleasantly surprised the rooms are very well appointed you have a full kitchen a desk a sofa and a very comfortable bed albeit it was full size not queen my only complaint is that the breakfast which was included was not good at all i did not have dinner which was also included the internet connection is not good however i prefer to use a mobile wifi which is secure if i had to rely on the hotel internet i would have not been happy overall if you need a nice clean place to sleep with comfortable amenities this is a good choice and the price is very reasonable,3.0
great hotel,we had a wonderful stay at hyatt we stayed in king room on the fifth floor above the swimming pool the hotel was very clean and nice i would stay there again all the employees were all freindly and helpful walking distance to the pier cable car and plenty of restaraunts we ate at both restraunts across the street we felt they were good and plentiful knuckles had an excellent buffett and food as well but a little more pricey however i would say is average with most restraunts,4.0
great hotel but too classic and old style,"four seasons is a very well known brand but mostly due to the service they provide
during my stay at the hotel the crowd was 90 years or older even though the staff is very young i couldnt feel very welcomed everybody is nice but very impersonal didnt feel very welcome and i felt i was one more number to the hotel
the rooms are spacious and work well for two experienced travelers however very classic and the plasma tvs dont go well with the furniture
the service is good but could be better for 5 hotel
location is good but not the best 
rates are what we expect for a four seasons but you can get a suite at a 4 for less
overall is good but not excellent",4.0

spacious rooms,"we stayed here for one week for sightseeing and enjoyed our stay very much the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful we had several inquiries for the concierge including making reservations at restaurants and were always helped promptly checkin and online reservations through the hotel website was smooth and without any problem 
the rooms were spacious in absolute terms not only in ny terms i think you could place an additional double bed in that room the only disadvantage is that that space was left quite unused aside a chair we had a couple of times breakfast in our room the rooms come with a kitchen but we did not have a second seat i cannot image how we would have managed to eat dinner here the kitchen would have allowed to prepare a real dinner anyway it sure was not very disturbing
as a whole the rooms are very clean and modern we asked for a room on a rather high floor and we got one on the 21st floor this gave us a splendid view on the city certainly recommended
the hotel is very well located the subway is just one block away 34th street also has a lot of shops empire state although i recommend rockefeller and madison square garden are within walking distance
highly recommendable",4.0

felt like i paid more for the room than i have actually paid,"the service is exquisite it felt like no else was staying in the hotel because the hotel employees was genuinely happy to greet us every time we walk in and walk out of the hotel

bigger than all of this we came to san antonio to visit a brother and the second day of our stay i got a call from home in missouri that our dad died i was not near a fax of my own or anything i needed for such an event but the general manager of the hotel labib is his name faxed funeral stuff out for me received faxes for me and was all around a fine and compassionate new friend sarah at the front desk also helped us plan our day trips with her great suggestions go and enjoy",5.0

nice stay at the hotel felix,my 10 year old son and i stayed at the hotel felix for two nights while the phillies were in town i got a great rate on priceline the staff checked us in at 10am on the day of our arrival and was permitted to check out at noon our last day i found the staff to be very accomodating and friendly room was small as stated in other reviews but it was nice bed was very comfortable our room looked over a parking lot when you looked down but i choose to look out and saw some nice views the location is good not great you are just off the action maybe four short blocks to michigan ave i would stay again,4.0
ok but not up to marriott standards in some ways,first of all im a mariott platinum premium which means i spend way too much time on the road and in marriotts the room was very good spotless and checkin was very pleasant the downside is that the hotel is overpriced even for the location tends to be a conference hotel and has a really bad room service menu its not that the food was bad it wasnt but the menu was pretty limited all in all an ok marriott but not at the price,3.0

hotel qt  be very careful,"review of the hotel qt
i recently stayed 4 nights at the hotel qt off of times square in new york city it is a newly opened hotel the design of the rooms and common areas is non traditional but fun the hotel staff were extremely pleasant and helpful however
i made my reservation through an internet site which handles only booking the reservation and suggests that you contact the hotel directly for rates etc i did twice before our arrival
i contacted the hotel qt about a month before my arrival and told them that this was a long anticipated daddaughters trip this would be my 17 and 19 year old daughters first trip to new york city obviously we would need a room with at least 2 beds i confirmed this a second time a couple of weeks before our arrival
when we arrived we were assigned a micro sized room with one small bed i had previously agreed to pay a premium rate for what was described as a roomy deluxe room no one would consider this a deluxe room and certainly no one would consider it roomy apparently this was the only room available and so one daughter slept on the floor and the other on a shelf under the tv while the room was far from deluxe and the room rate was outrageous
the following night we moved to an entirely acceptable room however rather than apologizing for their obvious error the night before we were treated to a room rate which skyrocketed to add injury to insult a friend of mine staying in the same hotel was given a room which was just a bit smaller than the one we had been moved to but charged substantially less per night he made his reservations several days after i had made mine
perhaps most disturbing aspect is the lack of responsiveness from hotel management i explained my situation to several hotel staff and left a written description of events for the manager i was absolutely guaranteed that the manager would get back to me while i left both cell phone and work numbers to date i have received no response
in fairness a night manager did listen sympathetically and reduced our rate by a nominal amount but in light of the amount we were being gouged the reduction was by her own admission insignificant
mistakes are going to happen from time to time but the fact is that as a result of their booking error my daughters had to sleep on the floor and a shelf per our the first night in our deluxe micro room the hotel qt compounded its original mistake by gouging us on the room rates and then avoided andor ignored their promise that a manager would get back to us
end of the world no but very disappointing yes",2.0
convinient for morning flights,"i stayed at this hotel the night before a flight and thought it was fine parts of the hotel are a bit dated but i think that some remodeling must have been done since some of the previous reviewers were there because it was fine 
my room was very well appointed with nice furnishings a good desk and a comfortable bed a portable crib had been left in my room from a previous guest and i needed a data cable so i called the front desk and within minutes someone was at my door with a cable and to take away the portable crib 
i had dinner at the hotel restaurant which is at the top of the hotel and rotates  that was fun the service was excellent and the food was pretty good 
the next day after check out i went downstairs to the airport tram and took it directly to my terminal  very convinient",4.0

beautiful lobby  hotel  but poor service  extra charges at every turn,"the hotel is grand and the lobby is beautiful with high ceilings filled with paintings reminiscent of the renaissance period great location to watch the parade and very central however my wife  i did not have a pleasant stay the service is poor we realised an error in our package selection romantic package vs breakfast package which is the same price same room type we were told computer would not let them swap it sorry one hour after we made the selection eventually forced them to get the manager at which point it was resolved without touching the computer  they just swapped our voucher walls are paper thin you can hear the beeps of the safe in the next room doors closing content of conversations etc
re costs the free breakfast voucher only covered the first 22 according to one staff member the next no could have whatever you liked from breakfast menu internet is 15 per day for throttledspeed or 20 per day for fullspeed to check your email in business centre is 795 for 15minutes use ie no free email checking fitness centre is extra 10 per day and so on dinner was 70pp for average buffet that closed before we had finished early checkout 11am

great hotel,"booked this hotel via priceline i was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews on here so i took it all with a grain of salt here is what i discovered

2 our room was large but i saw the small rooms when walking down the halls
3 its an historic hotel and i enjoyed being part of its history
4 all of the presidents stay here
5 great staff no problems
the only complaint that seemed to be true is that the walls are a bit thin and you can hear your neighbor we had kids for the model un next door 
so i would stay here again it was close to cheap parking at the boston common and it was near a lot of restaurants
great hotel to pick up via priceline",4.0
not sure why this hotel has such a high rating ,"my stay nothing capable of 5 stars during checkin the computer system shut down staff just stood there and talked while the checkin line grew to over 100 guests my criticism is that staff should have informed those of us waiting in line what the issue was nothing fancy just honest and accurate information rather then seeing from afar staff talking and joking around while customers wait and wait and wait 45 minutes to check it ouch
my first assigned is was yuck small very small dingy no furniture other then a very small bed and night stand the television was bolted to the wall almost behind the door as that is how small the room was it did not move or angle the window was blocked with the fire escape stairs i walked in had such a awful feeling that i immediately left and when to the check in desk another long wait i was given another room on another floor i was promised a queen bed the next room was a little bit bigger but not much the this room did have a tv standcredenza and the view was unobstructed thank you however the bed was small 
all in all there really is nothing special about this hotel it is old and tired management please check the rust patch growing on the bathroom shower towel holder in room 20170 yuck the bed was small full size but comfortable the bathroom was small the door almost hits the toilet and is awkward to close if you are a larger person as there is no room to maneuver the door must be either opened or closed in order for me to fit no coffee in rooms the line at starbucks downstairs was over 50 people at 9am 
the keypad on the inroom safe did not work dead battery management again please check the room to make sure all is in working order
walls are paper thin as i could hear discussions and activities of the rooms on both sides 
but all in all the location is great easy access to l subway  restaurants and entertainment
looking back the most positive interaction i had with any hotel staff was at the bell desk thanks guys these men were quick witted friendly and johnny on the spot for my luggage needs we had a good conversation and quite a few laughs
the most negative was the gal directing the checkin line worthless as she did not interact with guests and only talked to staff see my beginning comment",2.0
great ambiance but not dcs best,"the rooms were a good size and the bathrooms use great soaps and the location is superb this hotel would be ideal as a city break for solo travelers or a young couplenot for long term business travel

barton creek golf outing,"my son purchased a two round golf package over night lodging and a breakfast through ideal golf an exceptional deal i golfed one round on the crenshaw course and the second round on the fazio foothills great course and really enjoyed them
the hotel staff was extremely pleasent and always mentioned me by name the hotel had plenty of things to do the meal we had there breakfast was great
the only downside is the traffic on highway 360 attempting to go to dinner very congestion and a royal pain however it did not take away from a great father son trip would certainly do it again",5.0
newer excellent value and location,this hotel was newer and appeared more business oriented but met our needs as tourists with a great location close to macys and easy access to two different subway lines which meant less transfers fast convenient competitive breakfast options with varied continental for 10 or full for 15 which was great for us as we had limited time in the mornings we had considered the hampton however we found the little more luxury concierge and extra cost for breakfast was the best value for us,5.0

very good but only on position,this was a hard one to review  we picked for position and it was spot on just of times square on check in after traveling hours we were told a room wasnt ready till 3pm so we had to leave our luggage it was 245pm when we did check in it was the smallest room ever no floor space for cases and we were there for 5 nights  only room to walk around the bed so we went back to reception and free upgrade  to a larger room all ok apart from had not been hoovered there was even some pills on carpet and other items that you could clearly see  we are not complainers but the pills could be anything and i took them to reception along with other bits  we were apologised to and that while we were out the room would be given a deep clean  but no the carpets were never hoovered the whole time we were there and behind furniture was discusting so take slippers  other than that the hotel was fine we were out site seeing day and night so it was ideal to crash and very good area but paying the sort of money we did you expect the place to be cleaned new york overall is brill but people dont do anything not even speak to you unless you tip  i only tip for good service not when people expect it which is what seems to go on in new york ,4.0

great location and value,"this hotel was very conveniently located right in fishermans wharf many tours meet around this area and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from its great for tourists
the room was clean and quite no view from my room though continental breakfast buffet was good make your own pancakes with a press of the button
also includedfree internet access
id definitely stay here again",5.0
comfortable and simple,"pros  this place is so handy to the mall you can walk to many sights or rent one of the capitol share bikes and see everything the staff were friendly and helpful 
cons  the place has had a bit of a refurbish and there is paint smears in places on things where its been a bit rushed  rough 
also the whole place features cheesy photos of a balding man and a younger woman in the theme of liaison  in places the theme is just a bit seedy to be honest",4.0
not a bad place,the mixed reviews i read about this place are all very appropriate the rooms are spacious and okay however it feels like a fixed up apartment our room had some imperfections however we werent in the room that long the beds are comfortable its clean and the location is superb i mean you can easily walk to the supreme court and library of congrass and the capitol if you need to go to the zoo then you can easily get on the subway that is only a long block away i got along with the staff just fine and depending who is there they are very helpful and full of information in the lobby there is free wireless internet no need to pay the 10 to get it in your room just remember to bring your laptop with your wireless card the breakfast was soso i mean there are cereals juices bagels and fruit this came in handy when we went to the zoo because we took some extra fruit and bagels in our backpack and had them as snacks please make sure that you do your homework if you will be going to this area because there are four 2nd and c streets nesenwsw i learned this the hard way you wont go wrong with this hotel and i got a great deal of 80 i would easily stay here again,4.0
great location and service,"weve just returned from a very nice stay at the marriott downtown checkin staff was extremely nice  abigail at the desk asked if we had any kids with us who might need special accommodations she was kind enough to offer my daughter some of the goodies from the nickolodeon package even though we were registered under a different rateplan
our room on the 19th floor was fine for us spotlessly clean and comfortable location was great enjoyed breakfast at the reading terminal market every day and the 711 across the street was great for snacks dd loved having the starbucks hot chocolate in the lobby every night philly phlash stop was less than a block away and we used the nearby subway stop for a trip to citizens bank park very handy
parking at the hotel was 36night  tax we found a garage 2 blocks away in chinatown with a 1024hour rate so opted to leave the car there the valets let us park in front of the hotel while we checked in and unloaded and the reverse on the departure which was very convenient
we used the pool quite a bit its a lap pool so not ideal for leisurely swimming though it seemed like the pool was mostly used by families during our stay 
would definitely stay here again if returning to philadelphia and rates were favorable",4.0
excellent hotel in the theatre district,we spent 5 nights and it was an excellent hotel experience we strongly reccomend it for couples families and even business trip not for business venue breakfast is very good quality even if is not too fancy concierge was very efficient in restaurant reservations for runners both central park and hudson river are very close,5.0
great location on the riverwalk,"i stayed at the grand hyatt riverwalk for a conference overall it was a good experience beautiful hotel and the location could not have been better we had a little over an hour for lunch during the conference and i was able to walk along the riverwalk to the mall food court for a quick lunch the conference rooms were easily accessible comfortable and set up well for our event
my only complaint is that my sheets kept coming off of the bed and exposing the mattress gross the mattress pad was stretched out and kept popping up i requested that the issue be fixed at the front desk they said it would be fixed but it wasnt i had to ask a second time before the issue was resolved i struggled with the sheets for two nights while needing to wake up early for the conference 
pros location friendly staff beautiful hotel
cons front desk did not take care of a housekeeping issue",4.0
perfect little hollywood i miss,"very nice for extended stay in mini suite would like a little more magic involved maybe some slight of hand around the pool or some old scary magic movies to watch in the room do some merch tie in w the castle i love magic so this was pefect if youre going over to the castle drink as much as you want and your a short treck up the driveway back to your room ladies remember this if you wear heals
i hope they keep this place a boutique hotel the price does not matter to me just keep it cool 
needs a 24hr coffee shop ala the standard and id never leave",4.0
good business hotel with amazing views,stayed in the hilton for a few nights on business the location was great extremely easy to get to from the airport via a walkway the views over the bay were fantastic and very easy to get to using public transport big room with a very large bathroom and two king size beds fantastic for a business trip,4.0
you can do better in austin,"i stayed at this hotel in late june when i was in austin on business
first thing i noticed upon entering the room was there was garbage in the trash can in the bathroom i dont think this is a big deal but always makes you wonder what else did they forget did the toilet get cleaned
i then proceeded to iron my shirt but the water resevoir had some corrosion in it and my shirt was stained and completely ruined
to cap it off i asked for a wake up for the morning i was leaving as i had to catch an early flight it never happened nor did my work colleague receive his 
when i was rushing out in the morning to make my flight because now im running late i stopped briefly at the front desk to complain i was told a manager would be in touch with me of course that never happened either
finally i went onto the hilton website and left a complain detailing the same issues as this review never heard from them
safe to say this is the last hilton i will be staying in",1.0
great service,historic landmark hotel in downtown denver close to larimer square rooms are a bit dated but very comfortable beds great showers great service all around with free car service to go for dinner and back free internet,5.0
never want to leave,i have always being a reader never a review writer well i just couldnt help myself this time i just l o v e the palomar hotel im still here and dont want to leave it truly takes a lot to wow me the staff is amazing and friendly i felt like i was back home in ga where everyone talks to everyone when you have a group of 20 and they can still remember all of your names thats amazing i love the energy every time i walk in its in a great location and everything is close by,5.0
thanksgiving in dc,"nice hotel  just as i expected for an embassy suites taxes are expensive nice area good breakfast get down to the breakfast early if you are there on a weekend or holdiay when families are staying 
we could walk to the white house and all of the monuments etc
rooms were nice and clean the bed was so comfortable the view was of a very close building but i guess i wasnt planning on looking out the window all that much anyway",5.0
great stay at jurys in boston,"we stayed for one night for a little weekend getaway in boston we chose jurys based on the tripadvisor reviews and werent disappointed what a lovely hotel and the people who worked there were super nice and accomodating we got a fantastic deal through one of the discount hotel websites and when we called to ask if we could check in an hour early or so they upgraded our room to a deluxe the room was very nice spotlessly clean and attractive the bathroom was goodsized with very nice amenities there was free internet access and a flatscreen tv the beds were super comfortable there was a fair amount of traffic noise from outside our window we had a room facing berkeley street but i consider this just part of staying at a hotel in a city 
the public areas are very attractive and kind of quirky with lighting overhead on the stairs and on a waterfall wall next to the stairs that change colors from green to blue to purple to red etcthere are very unusual gas fireplaces covered with sparkly stones i know it sounds odd but it looks great the trash containers near the elevators had a bowl of potpourri on one side  we ate dinner at cuffs the bar on the lower level and had a great meal of sandwiches and fries with two awesome desserts which i would highly recommend a trio of ice creams in cups made of thin cookies and a blackberry creme brulee prices were very reasonablewe had breakfast in the stanhope restaurant and it was very good too pricey though if you dont order either the full or the continental buffet where the beverages are included watch out for the prices on the juices and coffee
all in all it was a great stay and id love to stay there again",5.0
wonderful home away from home,we enjoyed our visit very muchroom was wonderful and the people made us feel like welcome guest we will visit again,5.0
trendy exceptionally friendly staff a real bargain for the price,"bottom line outstanding boutique hotel this is so different from a chain hotel it doesnt make sense to try to compare it to one if you want a sterile cookie cutter same as i stayed at in you will be disappointed if you want unique friendly and trendy this is the place to stay
we were attending the 2011 hollywood reel independent film festival at the near by new beverly cinema and wanted to stay in the area at a boutique hotel we were not disappointed 
the farmers daughter hotel appears to have been designed as a quintessential motor court in the 50s or 60s it has been redesigned and they have done an amazing job of working with in the constraints of the original structure we stayed in room 101 located in a quiet corner of the property i dont know what the other rooms look like so this is unique to 101 the room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural the bedding was very comfortable the faucet was style like an old fashioned sink pump the shower was simple but included an adjustable rain style head and there was plenty of hot water
the staff were all very friendly and attentive they made every attempt to accommodate us as we dealt with the logistics of visitors they helped us find a great place to eat  animal  just up the street it didnt matter if it was midnight or 8 am there was always a smile and helpful attitude over all i cannot say enough about the facility and staff if you are in the west hollywood area dont miss the farmers daughter",5.0
location location,my daughter and i stayed at the milford plaza for 4 nights and in my opinion as a seasoned traveller you cant beat the milford on price and location sure it is being renovated but during our stay no inconvenience what so ever    sure the rooms are small but so are so many other ny hotels but if you are serious about seeing all that ny has to offer then you wont be spending too much time in your room,5.0
great hotelgreat location,"my wife and i visited nyc in early october to see some broadway shows and enjoy the new york city cuisine the hotel elysee came highly rated on tripadvisor everything i read about the hotel was true first of all the location you can get anywhere in the city from 43rd and madison all the staff from the doormen welcoming you to the hotel to the front desk staff were courteous friendly and extremely helpful the housekeeping staff did a great job in servicing the rooms there were no bedbugs validating the accuracy of the bedbug report 
the continental breakfast in the club room on the 2nd floor was excellent fresh bagels and bread cereals hard boiled eggs fresh fruit and yogurts were there for the taking and replenished as needed lattes or cappuccinos were there for the asking the staff who looked after the breakfast were very pleasant and congenial monday to friday in the late afternoon there is wine champagne and cheese served in the same club room its too bad they dont have it on the weekends i made sure i got to try it when we arrived friday afternoon i dont know why there are so many negative comments about the single elevator its a european style hotel and thats what they have in europe except this elevator is twice the size we didnt have to wait long for an elevator at anytime
the rooms were a very nice size and you are able to open the windows i like that the bathroom is down the hall and separate from the sleeping area the hotel was booked through bookingcom and i found the rate to be reasonable i highly recommend the elysee and we will definitely stay there again next year as far as dining in the area is concerned i highly recommend del friscos steakhouse the steak and the atmosphere was amazing its at 39th and sixth ave a short walk from the hotel forget about magnolia bakery for the cupcakes head to crumbs there are quite a few stores and there is one nearby the hotel on madison avenue",4.0
great location near downtown seattle overlooking a nice park,"we stayed at the hotel two separate times on our trip to washington last week the location to all of the popular attractions is perfect the one thing youll learn about seattle is that youll get used to walking while you can easily get around town in a rental car its much easier to just use your legs
in regards to the hotel it was very clean and includes your typical amenities including shampoo body wash lotion and conditioner this hotel uses a pump system to dispense the various items in the shower as well as at the sink preventing a ton of waste with the little bottles there is also a safe refrigerator and microwave in the two different rooms that we stayed in two double beds as well as a single double bed room
the front desk staff was helpful even though there was a little mixup when we checked in there had been a large group that had checked in earlier in the day that wanted to move their rooms around for whatever reason the person that had been working during that period accidentally gave away our room two double beds and we ended up staying in a single bed room for the night the staff person quickly offered a lower price on the smaller room and indicated we could switch to our correct room the following night no harm no foul on that
one thing to watch out here is the breakfast room especially on the weekend we went into the room around 9am and it was a nut house they do not have enough seating for the size hotel that it is so plan on getting your food and taking it back to your room the other guests i found to be very rude in the breakfast room acting as if it was their last meal but i guess that can sometimes be expected when there are free items in the room
the poolwhirlpoolsauna are all open 24 hours which was nice since most hotels close their poolsspa area down around 1011pm
parking is 10night but free parking is very rare anywhere in the greater seattle area however if you use foursquare you can checkin to the hotel location and unlock a free parking special at least as of when i was there last week
all in all i would say that i would have no problem staying here again especially with the location you are just close enough to everything yet far enough away to be away from the majority of the city noise",4.0
nice but average hotel,this hotel has a nice lobby decent breakfast and is well located the carpets in the room were filthy stained and the first hotel that i wore my shoes the whole stay they could certainly use new carpetingit makes the nice room feel dirty however the staff was nice the beds comfortable so for me it was average nothing great and not that bad either just not the kind of hotel that i enjoy,3.0
would not recommend,i stayed in this hotel for 2 nights  july 2526 with a friend and this hotel was chose by a tour group that we booked with in montreal we had reserved 2 double beds and were given a room with one double bed the manager was not very polite about it and acted as if giving us a room with 2 single beds that we know someone else from out gorup got changed out of was doing us a huge favor the room was old and dingey the toilet gurgled and spit water on the floor every so often and there was no fan the lobbys furniture was old and dirty the hotel should be refurbishing no radio no minibar the airconditioning was very noisy and smelled awful moldlike my friend woke up the next day so congested and stayed that way until we were home i suffer from allergies dust mold etc and did have symptoms i would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is particular about cleanliness brighness of the room and space in the washroom extremely small the location is fantastic however  right in time square too bad,1.0
good clean hotel right near times square,i booked this hotel after reading ta reports very glad i did the hotel is a block and a half from time square and we walked to most places from there the hotel is an older art deco building and very nice inside all the staff were helpful and obliging yes the lifts are old and slow but thats not a big problem except in the mornings when everyone tries to leave around the same time we had an executive room which gave us free wifi  bonus our room had plenty of space but was not huge  enought for the two of us but the bathroom was tight the shower in our bathroom was one of the best ive ever used windows that actually open there was a mini bar microwave and a safe soft and comfortable beds with clean and fresh linen all in all the rooms were good unfortunately we decided to have breakfast downstairs one morning it is a buffet but it really wasnt worth the effort bland cold food that wasnt worth the money esp when there are so many good food places nearby we didnt go back again would happily stay there again but certainly not bother with the food there,5.0
the only place i will stay when in nyc,"we travel to nyc about 4year and after having stayed at numerous other hotels over the years  we decided to try the beekman after hearing from a friend about the excellent food and accomodations were glad we did the suites were beautifully decorated the staff courteous and welcoming and the food was scrumptious we have dined at both the main level restaurant and at the skyline level  the view was breathtaking 
the waitstaff was courteous and we even noted that the head chef came out and checked on the guests and their mealsevenings  what a pleasant and nice touch keep up the good work beekman  well be back",5.0
great place to stay for weary travelers,we were on our last leg of our trip back to illinois and found this gem nice front desk nice big queen beds  great for 9 and 11 year olds with parents  good breakfast with cold cereals yogurt waffles bagels juices and coffee nice bathroom as well the kids enjoyed the pool  a few details for the hotel management  maybe touch up the metal parts in the pool area on the signs  showing rust spots from water condensation on walls otherwise very nice overall,4.0
great modern hotel at a good price cant go wrong,there were plenty of staff at checkin the rooms were modern in design spacious and clean plenty of comfy pillows late night dining room service was quick breakfast room service was right on time the location was about a 1015 minute walk5 cab ride to merchandise mart where my work required me to be would definitely stay there again,5.0
top notch service and amenities,"from the moment my husband and i walked in to the hotel we felt at home we stayed for three days over christmas and every aspect of our visit was very enjoyable from the doorman to registration to housekeeping the restaurant and staff and everything in between everybody we encountered was polite helpful and genuinely seemed to care about our visit 
the food and service in the restaurant was superior next year make sure you book a reservation for the christmas buffet the view from our room was breathtaking the room smelled clean and fresh the bed was heavenlyi could go on forever thank you hyatt for making this a very special christmas",5.0
good location business men like hotel but nice,the room was ok with a beautiful view of the city and the bathroom was clean and spacious the location was perfect walking distance to shopping and restaurantsthe staff was nice and helpful the hotels restaurant was nice and the food was quite good but the thai restaurant attached to the hotel which has a direct entrance from the hotel was not very good at all and the people working there were not very friendly its a business men type hotel clean nice big,3.0
sheraton fishermans wharf,we had a fantastic experience based at sheraton fishermans wharf the location is excellent as it is around the corner or a short walk from the main activities of the pier area lots of restaurants and places of interest nearby the rooms and service were excellent with no complaints we were lucky to have a room above the main lobby area so we could log into the free wi fi from the comfort of our room we went on the alcatraz tour as well as the open top bus tour around san francisco which was very informative the biggest surprise was the walt disney family museum we thought we would go for the kids but it was a fantastic history of walt disneys life and his start in animation highly recommend,5.0
nice room and five star service,"great place for a 3night stay our king room overlooked the pool and was very quiet but we sure did not need the beds heavy comforter in the texas heat fortunately there was a light blanket in the closet 
service could not have been better staff members were amazingly helpful friendly and knowledgable about the area i made an online reservation the day before i wanted to arrive and i requested a room without scenting cleaning products and away from the elevator staff made sure both requests were fulfilled later when the inroom telephone misbehaved a hotel employee was promptly there to fix it a front desk clerk knew just where to find a nearby selfserve carwash when the tv was blaring in the breakfast room we were able to get the sound turned down during our visit we bought a new camera and accidentally trashed the camera box with the strap inside our garbage had just been taken out so we asked if we could check the trash a staff member volunteered to check the garbage and he found the box retrieved the strap and had it delivered to our room in very little time
bonuses included the freshly baked cookies at the front desk and dvds to check out for free the rooms have dvd players",5.0
great basic hotel in excellent location,"when i began my search for a reasonably priced hotel reasonable for new york that is i had several specifications
1 private bath  im at the point in my life where i dont share well with others especially bathrooms
2 decent location  walking distance to at least one subway line
3 free wifi  i never leave home without the laptop
what i found with the hotel deauville
clean basic room with my private bath
the hotel is within walking distance of the 456 lines  the nqrw lines which with connections will take you anywhere you want to go in the city
free  fast wifi to help me make lastminute plans
i also got air conditioning which was welcome on two muggy nights
i need to reiterate that this is a basic budget hotel  its definitly not the ritz or even the holiday inn but its a clean quiet place to put your head down after spending the day in this fabulous city",4.0
best stay ever for the price,we were in town to see the king tut exhibit downtown we brought our dog and the hotel was very pet friendly usually when traveling with a pet they give you one of the rooms that isnt the greatest not the case here the room was on the lobby floor with a back door leading out to the pool and hot tub it was too cold outside to use the pool but the hot tub was great beautiful courtyard around the pool the room was very clean and comfortable continental breakfast in the lobby was nice good variety including make your own waffles the lobby had beautiful marble flooring and lots of sunlight with floor to ceiling windows facing the pool area we would definately stay again,5.0
great value close to cherry creek and hwy 25,this is a very nice fairfield inn close to cherry creek and washington park the foyer is clean and homey and the breakfast area was large and well stocked with lots of breakfast options free wifi nice room and a 42 inch plasma there is some traffic noise from colorado bvd even on an upper floor we were on the 8th floor but we did have a view of the mountains,4.0
comfy beds in a busy and loud downtown area of sf,"stayed here with my girlfriend in 2 separate stays either side of a camping trip to yosemite augustseptember and my first thought was so easy to get to desperate for a quick afternoon sleep after an early flight over we were horrified to hear the surprisingly loud street noises which went on pretty much 247 and kept me grouchy and sleepless for the first 3 nights we were there not that i expect a quiet stay in downtown san francisco but it wouldnt hurt to invest in some windows that attempted to block the sound out needless to say the room was at the front of the hotel so id request that you dont stay there if i were you if you do stay at the front be prepared for loud noise all night and no chance of a lie in homeless man drumming outside isnt that talented in case you wondered
our 2nd stay however was totally different it was at the back of the hotel pretty much quiet the whole night and we slept well the room was about twice the size too we had 2 double beds instead of 1 and the ensuite was definitely bigger with a more powerful shower 
wi fi didnt work on the 5th floor but did work on the 6th not the end of the world really  loads of places in san fran have free wi fi if you need to log on 
2 or 3 of the hotel staff were really unfriendly which was unfortunate as it didnt feel like many of them would be very accommodating if we had any requests on 2nd thoughts this may have been because it seemed to double up as a student residence and therefore they probably saw people so regularly it would drive them crazy smiling all the time saying that the guy that worked over night was really helpful in getting us to our tour bus for yosemite at 6am so it evened out a little
2 very different stays but i was mainly frustrated because of the noise at the front of the hotel in the first stay and slept terribly 2nd stay was probably 4 stars",3.0
very charming,this is a very charming hotel located next to the river and close to the ben franklin bridge i called a couple of days in advance and got a great deal from the concierge on a room with a fireplace and whirlpool tub the room was spacious and had a tiny balcony which faced the alley which was fine because it was quiet and the building across the way was empty the whirlpool was not really what i expected and was an oversized bathtub the concierge was very friendly and accommodating and the bar in the lobby has a great selection of wines the neighborhood is chock full of great restaurants bars and coffee shops i would bring slippers because some parts of room have wooden flooring and is cold we had a very romantic relaxing time overall and i would definitely stay here again,4.0
best hotel in united state,"we were totally happy during the time at this hotel room location staff were very great beds are really comfortable nice flat screen tv safe in the room free internet and a nice big shower that even has a seat but no bathtub in case you carewe didnt 
great in everything and we must come back next time",5.0
what you expect from a four seasons including prices,"the beverly hills four seasons is a beautiful hotel the grounds and rooms are everything you would expect from a four seasons my room was a lower floor so i had an entire outside deck to myself rather than just a small balcony the bathroom complete with its own television was fantastic and i used the wake up call every morning without incident
i will point out that even after youve spent the money on your room be prepared to drop a lot more coin the first day there we had a pitcher of their sangria at the cabana by the pool the pitcher was 64 the only restaurant on site is a incredible one but its also priced as such the only parking available is valet which was 30 a night all that being said the hotel is magnificent
we had mixed results from the concierge and while we were there the normal rolls royce was in the shop and had been for over a month so we a mercedes in its place this was convenient for getting to our location however on the way home the driver was unable to pick us up because he was too busy 
all in all the hotel is phenomenal and in a great location within short driving distance of the hollywood sign the walk of fame rodeo drive the studios and the capitol records building",5.0
good location but needs better windows,great location right next to the convention center and just a few blocks from the alamo right on the river walk the rooms were clean and good service but the carpet in the hallways looks dated for a fairly new hotel the only real dissappointment was that you could hear the traffic outside through the windows not loud but when you are getting into bed and everything else is quiet you could hear it cant say it kept me up more of a distraction,4.0
fantastic five days,"my sister and i took our teens to nyc last week we were lucky enough to stay at the belvedere hotel we found the staff exceptionally professional hospitable and helpful
the rooms were spotless the beds comfortable and the overal environment quiet and calm the refrigerator microwave coffee pot and kitchen sink make it possible to eat breakfast in our rooms each morning our only complaint was that the elevators wait can be a bit long at times 
the location was so convenient on a quiet street but within minutes to theatres restaurants delis subway stations and times square strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for reasonably priced and safecomfortable lodging",5.0
we would stay in this hotel again,we found the omni severin to be delightful our room was exceptionally clean the staff was very friendly the amenities were lovely this hotel is wonderfully located to enjoy all the activities sports shopping restaurants leisure in downtown indy,5.0
june gloom but awesome time at hard rock,"wife and i stayed at the hard rock recently and had an amazing visit check in went smooth there was no wait and the girl that checked us in was super nice we found out that she is from oklahoma so it was kinda cool talking to her 
we were given the introduction by a nice young man he took us to our room on the top floor and showed us how to operate everything he was super nice i ran into him a few more times during our stay and he would always greet us and ask how things were going
we were in a suite a pretty awesome sweet i believe it was called the black eyed peas suite it ran about 33000 a night i am very glad that my wifes company was picking up the bill i loved the shower with the two spray heads one normal and the other coming down from the ceiling the decorations were pretty awesome loved the contemporary feel we slept very well in the beds and found the reading lamps very cool and useful 
we had a view facing downtown and the gaslamp area it was cool to look out at night and see everything going on everything is so lit up if i looked over the balcony and too the left i could see an aircraft carrier in the harbor if i looked to the right i could see part of petco field there were games going on two of the nights we were there it got loud when they scored not too loud we kept the balcony doors open most of the time we were in the room except for when we were sleeping when the doors were closed we really didnt hear much except for an ocassional siren or horn after a couple of days i tried to get a pool view suite but since there was a huge conference in town there were no rooms available
got to check out the pool area a few times never swam we hung out for a bit and did some people watching there were several parties going on during our stay if you want to party like a rockstar then this is the place to be seen a few celebrities in and around the hotel it was pretty awesome
didnt check out any of the restaurants in the hotel but they do have a yogurt place connected that was fabulous we did try to eat at mary janes one night but they had already closed fyi there is a convenient storedeli around the corner that was very handy
we really had a great time at the hotel loved the location loved the staff loved the visit wish we could have stayed longer",5.0
business,my stayeing in thiss hotel was good but what i can tell you is that kind of hotel is good for business staying egjust a couple days if i can choose if this hotel i want for my holiday staying i will say no nice interior athmosphere cleaning serviseetcbut i can call this hotel  hotel on the way or fast food hotel ,3.0
great location,"my partner and i wanted to get away fro the weekend and book this place with pricelines name your own price we got an excellent deal and were happy that this hotel was just a block or two from the 6th street mall which made it nice to be able to walked around have dinner and drinks be a short walk from the hotel
 the staff was smiley and friendly the place was nice enough rooms were good but not anything about it stood out or screamed this is a 4 star hotel the fitness area and pool wasmeh we stayed in a standard king size room the bed was comfortable we were lucky to have a high floor and an excellent view the bathtub was deep and spacious we had a snack and some drinks late at night at the lounge and it was very good they have a late night happy hour with excellent deals try the sweet potato friesi 
overall not bad probably best for business rather than a couples getaway again for what we payed excellent but i think at the regular rate id opt for somewhere else with a bit more ambiance for my needs for a business traveler it may be a better fit",4.0
nothing wrong with this hotel but not a particualrily good value,"my husband and i stayed there for 3 nights and while we did not have an unpleasant experience we also did not have a remarkable experience the hotel was clean the bed comfortable the ac worked well and the hotel was quiet however it was not that different from the best of the hampton inns for the price we paid i expected a more luxurious room we stayed at another marriott on vancouver island last year and for the same price we really had a luxurious room luxurious bedding and a marble and granite bathroom this one simply was not up to that standard
i thought the bar was quite expensive for two glasses of wine one mixed drink  two light  snack type meals the tab was almost 10000
 there was no free access to a computer  to print our airline boarding passes early and even in the room the daily fee to plug in your own computer was 995 each day",3.0
modern tasteful awesome locationgreat overall,we stayed at the on the ave for our honeymoon and had a great time the location is beautiful and not too busy you are no more than 3 blocks from a subway station the staff is awesome they were so helpful it was unreal the rooms were a decent size superior room but were very nice and modern and youre only 3 blocks from central park there are some nice little bakeries near by and with the subway you are like 3035 mins from time square the hotel itself does not have room service but the restaurant across the street acts as room service and will bring food up we loved this place and would recommend it to anyone and will be going back,5.0
location,"we stayed at the salisbury between the 21st and the 25th of october 2011 the hotel staff and greeting were both polite and informal with the minimum of fusswe stayed on the 11th floor facing west 57th street unaware of the competition taking place across the street to find the loudest mechanical digger in america
the hotel itself has loads of character the rooms were spacious and the beds large and comfortable visiting new york though if you spend more than your sleeping hours in your room then you are wasting your time there get out and walk around
the decor is a little jaded as you would expect with a hotel of that age but a superficial touch up is all it needs leave the old lady alone to grow old disgracefully
the hotel offer you a continental breakfast for the fixed price of 6 the fare is ok if you like coffee and pastries for your breakfast
around the corner down 57th street we found a place called the rock and roll deli it offers a full breakfast at 6 which includes tea or coffee and has eggs of your choice sausagebacon home friestoast butter and a pancakethe breakfast is very good and challenges you to go out and walk it off which i guarantee you will
our other option of breakfast that regrettably we only found out on our last morning was to walk into central park which is only about a two hundred yard walk from your front door go past the bethseda fountain  the fountain featured at the start of the tv show friends  about three or four minute walk past there is the boathouse restaurant this place is split into an upmarket restaurant and a cafe style eatery you can get a full breakfast of your choice for 7 only and sit there with the vista of the early morning sun over the boating lake in front of youyou may well be so moved by the sight and a full stomach as to make you reconfirm your undying love to your partner it did me no harm
new york reviews i read before going there for the first time mainly always refer to getting a hotel with a prime location to all the sights you wish to see this hotel has this in spadesonce you work out how to navigate the streets and avenues everything within new york is within reasonable walking distance of the hotel
as i have referred to earlier on the mechanical digger competition absolute purgatory
you can hear the street noise per se through your rooms air con unit however their is a derelict space directly across the street from you and the morning chorus starts like this
10630am large lorries arrive and take pleasure in reversing up and down the street to show off their reversing alarm noises
2 0650am the drivers of the above vehicles get out of their cabs and attempt to out do each other in the ancient art of whistling and shouting loudly
3 0700am on the dot the multi skilled shouter and whistlers then alight their respective mechanical diggers and begin to hydraulically hammer the hell out of the new york bedrock beneath themit is impossible to ignore and means you are forced out of your room by 730 am
i suppose it may well be a planned rouse by the new york tourist board to get frazzled hotel guests out of their rooms and into their retail outlets the rouse works unequivocally
all in all i would definitely go back there but only after the us olympic digging team had finished there training",4.0
my first choice,i am a seasoned traveler lived in ny my entire life until recently i absolutely loved the hotel staff are second to none room was ample tastefully decorated and clean location could not be better if you want to do the sights of the city it has a very european feel which personally suits me pricey but thats manhattan would definitely return and recommend,5.0
2 week holiday we have stayed here every year for the past 10 years ,"since change of ownership a few years ago the hotel has lost its friendly charm the reception staff do not remember returning guests and dont even know who the new owners are
the most unacceptable change of new ownership is that they now allow the general public to use the swimming pool for 1020 per day this has resulted in very noisy unruly and rude childrencarers into an otherwise relxing pool area the swimming pool area is the best feature of this hotel and this has now been totally destroyed it we were guests staying at the hotel for the first time we would not return it is only because we have been staying at the hotel on a regular basis for over 10 years this is a false sens of economy  remove the general public and give more priority and attention to your fee paying guests please",3.0
perfectly average big hotel,"first off i must say that thanks to priceline i got my room here for about 200 a night which was super cheap compared to everywhere else i looked so for that price a bed was all i needed it is a perfectly average big convention hotel nothing remarkable but nothing awful either
the room was very nice and comfy and i like the bath products that they stock they smell good view was crappy in the day not that i was in my room much but at night could see fenway and the citgo sign all lit up
my bellman was very nice
trouble spots were
rooms dont have wifi yet which i would expect in 2009 
valet service was horrible i called ahead 45 minutes like youre told to and when i came down they had not done a thing so i still had to wait outside about 35 minutes thus i was very late for a dinner reservation
when i initially called for directions the concierge was a bit snippy when i asked her to slow down so that i could write down what she was saying very odd but maybe she was having a bad day",3.0
very pleasant small hotel,competent staff very clean rooms comfortable bed reasonably priced and good complimentary breakfast selection property is convenient to times square subway and the hells kitchen market weekends is just down the street,4.0
clean friendly  economical choice,"we just got back from a weekend stay at the wharf inn the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful the room was very clean i do agree with previous opinions about it being a little too warm however
this is a great place to stay if you are looking for basic affordable lodging right in the middle of all the great sf tourist attractions
the free parking is a great feature most other hotels charge 30  38 per day which is something people may forget to consider",4.0
this hotel was the highlight of my trip,"i spent 17 days in the northeastern and mid atlantic states in august  september 2011 and thoroughly enjoyed my time in washington dc and the palomar in an attempt to get out of the way of the direct path of hurricane irene  i called the hotel palomar to see if i could check in three days early not a problem not only was it not a problem the price for my stay went down nice and it was already reasonable to begin with because i have an aaa card less than 200 in washington dc pretty amazing
the hotel personnel were very welcoming  from the front door personnel who learned my name from the moment i arrived and chatted whenever i came or left to the front desk personnel who were enthusiastic and helpful and the cleaning personnel who were friendly it was a welcome change from other stops i made on this trip 
the hotel did very well in communicating its hurricane plan for guests and provided instructions regarding food what happens if the lights go out etc 
the location is good  a few blocks from the dupont circle metro station and enough people out at all hours to make it feel safe lots of restaurants shops and art galleries nearby the national mall is 2 metro stops away and very easy to get to 
i would stay at this hotel again if i have an opportunity to return to washington dc",5.0
welcoming  posh,we travelled 8 hours to attend a concert in columbus and chose the westin for a 2 night stay  this was no mistake the valet service was quick and friendly upon arriving we were greeted with champagne and personal welcoming service the staff we quick to offer us inside tips on how to get the best of hot spots for locals and tourist points our room was slightly smaller than the average and as a result were given a voucher for the in house bar and eatery the room was fantastic as were all the amenities the discount was a nice gesture a large wedding was scheduled and as a result rooms were scarce the on site bar was fantastic and seemed to be full of locals and tourists alike  a nice mix the hotels decor was posh and in no need of updating the service was excellent there is a lot to see and do in columbus this hotel comes highly recommended if you are visiting the area,5.0
luxury and beauty meet convenience,"we recently stayed at the hotel andra during a weekend getaway to seattle and couldnt have asked for a nicer place to stay aside from the convenient location blocks away from pike place market and downtownbelltown shopping and restaurants this hotel is beautiful i felt comfortable and welcome immediately with the cozy lobby and friendly staff and right at home in our room that overlooked fourth ave the hotel is a seamless mix of original 1920s details and modern decor and the bed was so insanely comfortable we actually opted to lounge about instead of touring around the neighborhood 
this may have been the nicest lodging ive ever experienced and i definitely hope to return on my next trip to the emerald city",5.0
friendly staff clean rooms,very friendly staff clean rooms very accommodating all at a reasonable price the free wifi is quick and has always worked which is important to me as a business traveler i usually dont partake of the free breakfast but it looks fine,5.0
an incredible experience,"i was blown away by the elegance and class of this hotel and its amenities the price for the hotel is steep but worth the splurge i recommed this hotel to everyone who travels to nyc not traveling on a budget one of my family members had their wedding reception here in february the food service and rooms themselves were above and beyond all my expectations
the rooms are opulent and the beds and pillows are top notch what a great nights sleep the hotel in located in midtown centrally located to everything in nyc
nicest hotel ive ever stayed at",5.0
two thumbs up,headed up to seattle to go to woodinville wine country so it was great that priceline gave us a hotel whose decor and activities revolve around washington wines each room is named after a washington winery and one of the hotels tv channels broadcasts a wa wine country documentary 247 cool stuff service is very friendly and the smallish lobby is like going back in time a century or so and although we didnt take advantage a different winery does a tasting in the lobby for guests every afternoon location was terrific 7 short blocks from pike place market and a similar distance to westlake center gateway to the seattle center monorail the rooms were clean comfortable and nicely decorated two negatives keep it from being a 5star on tripadvisor for me first our 2nd floor room was at street level downtown seattle is very hilly street noise was minimal to nonexistent but more of a view would have been nice one of the hazards of priceline i suppose second overnight parking was 30 steep that said i can definitely recommend the hotel and would stay here again without hesitation,4.0
old old old and really tired,"why is this hotel a westin it is a shame for the hotel chain to own this property and i am not exagerating
after reading terrible reviews about the hotel i contacted the property and told them my concearns regarding the condition of the hotel they told me to give them a change and that they were sure the reviews were not up to the hotelthey ended up convincing mebad mistake
first the car drive of the hotel is horrible the entrance letters are torn off and the lamps are broke the floor is full of bird pooreally disgusting
the lobby is really old and the furniture is dreadful the style is really old and they tried to decorate it with minmalist furniture in bad shape
check in staff is really bad
elevators are really old they even crack
hallways have very bad management the walls are stained carpet torn down and a funny smell
rooms are big but inhospitable you dont feel like being in your room the furniture is in a terrible shape scratched stained broken beds are good but you find the same bed at all westin hotels the only good thing about the room was the tv
staff is terrible throughout the hotel they are rude and it seems they dont care the only friendly staff were the waiters at zuccinis which has delicious breakfast
stay away from this hotel dont waste your money in here stay at the jw marriott across the street which is beautiful and has recently been renovated or at the nearby st regis
ive seen the management response to negative comments saying that the hotel is going to be renovated little by little this hotel should be shut down until the renovation is complete
i am really disapointed at westin",3.0
great location fantastic price,"we stayed at the columbus for 3 nights early april booking with the hotel directly via their website for a suite with 1 queen bed and 2 doubles  non smoking we requested a high floor room and were allocated room 215 which faced columbus avenue and was located on the 2nd floor at the very end of a long corridor 
at first i was apprehensive about having a room facing columbus avenue as i am a light sleeper and have read past reviews about the traffic noise but i was not kept awake by the street noises at all however as we were there from a friday night to a monday morning the traffic noise may be different on a weekday
we found the suite to be very clean and it was great to have individual air conditioning units in each room when we woke each morning we put the air conditioners on and the rooms quickly heated up we found it a bit chilly in the mornings
sure the furniture is not ultra chic and of modern design however there was plenty of drawers and wardrobes if you wanted to unpack all the furniture was a dark timber almost antique design and was not shabby at all 
the queen bed was located in a seperate room from the two doubles which allowed privacy 
the bathroom was clean and free of mould etc with the shower located over the bath and toilet located in same room
 the water pressure of the showe was fantastic and we did not find the shower head too low at all as previously reported and husband is 6 2 tall it was good to have a large vanity and basin located just outside the bathroom with a hairdryer
there is a very large ice machine on each floor located next to the elevators it might be wise to not get a room near this area as the ice machine was really really noisy all the time it seemed to be constantly churning over the ice and sounded like it was about to take off into orbit it was so noisy 
we did go to pats cafe once for breakfast which is located in a nearby side street but we found the menu very limited and a bit expensive we then discovered a cafe on columbus ave heading 3 blocks towards fishermans wharf  across the road from the holiday inn the dinercafe sorry cant remember the name had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also located next to the diner was an internet coffee shop we used the internet here to precheckin for our flight on southwest airlines and they also printed the boarding passes for 50cents per page
the columbus inn was a fantastic find in a great location for a truely great price and we easily walked to fishermans wharf lombard street and to the pier which the ferry for alcatraz tours leaves from and we caught the bus which leaves outside the hotel to union square and then caught the cable car back
i had originally booked a hotel in union square but then changed my mind and booked the columbus motor inn mainly for the great price and for the additional bedroom and i was so glad that we didnt stay at union square as my husband and 2 teenage sons were not at all interested at shopping at all so i was glad we settled for a hotel that was close to fishermans wharf and the attractions that are in that area
when i pointed out to them the hotel that i had originally booked at union square they were all so relieved that i made the accommodation change to the columbus and so was i
we also could not fault the professionalism of the front desk staff who were always ready to provide information and maps of the area we also arrived 3 hours earlier than checkin time and our room was ready which was really nice after a long 13 hour flight from australia
our stay at the columbus motor inn was made purely from reading the reviews on tripadvisor and we were not dissapointed at all we would stay here again without hesitation",5.0
great stay,"we stayed here on january 1st 2012 before a flight the hotel was nice and the room was great for an airport hotel the price was right and look forward to staying here again the next time i need to fly out of philly early in the morning 
the rooms were nice beds were so soft and it felt like sleeping on a pillow rooms were quiet and couldnt here any of our neighbors the open bar from 530pm730pm was also very nice we got there at 650pm so we did not get to fully enjoy it the only problem we had was the floors outside the room were not the cleanest there were shreds of paper on the ground in front of our room and some other rooms
i would tell my friends to stay here",4.0
closer almost not possible  good for the nights,"if you are looking for a bed and shower  here we go only 100 meter away from the cable car stop bush street only 2 blocks from union square a 23  fee for valet parking in the parkhouse across the street thats all we needed for our stay in sf not taking the free continental breakfast its only hot drinks and some kind of bredcake we can recommend loris diner one block away direction union square walk down and its on the right side
the rooms at the grant are older some look modern some look oldstyle but they are clean and functional offering cabletv a showerbath and a you need the only crtitic i can do is that the hotel is kind of sensitive to noise coming from rooms above either reflected by the wall of the neighbouring house or from the floor
free wlan is offered in the lobby its not too fast even when many people are surfing a starbucks is only one block away
stay in the heart of sf stay in grant  i would take it again",4.0
great small place,i was expecting this hotel to be quite good in light of all the reviews that have been posted here i was not dissapointed the location is prime  there is a subway station just one block north from the hotel we stayed in a room with a double bed and a private bathroom it was small but manageable it was decorated nicely something youd expect a suffragette to stay in during the early 1900s there was a tv a very efficient heater and ac the rooms were cleaned each day very nicely the hotel itself was quiet the entire time only on saturday night did some street noise filter in but we turned on the air to low and it was blocked out be sure to book your room through the internet or with the internet price on hand over the phone  its much cheaper the staff was friendly and the iron and ironing board i borrowed from them worked well my only quip is that the man who checked us in gave us an uncomfortable and bothersome stare and remark about my boyfriend and i sharing a double bed he wasnt hostile but you sure dont expect it less than a mile from where the stonewall riots took place also the elevator is small but quaint with its archaic gated door all in all a great great great place for those people who dont need to be pampered and overcharged but enjoy sleeping in comfortable and quiet hotels,5.0
i will return,"we stayed two nights in room 432 a deluxe double queen room the room is located at the back of the hotel with a view of the space needle it is spacious enough for our party which consisted of 3 travelers the decor is funky and vibrant following the theme throughout the rest of the hotel
you cant beat the location within a ten minute walk you find yourself at seattle center the pike place market and waterfront or westlake center the hotels neighborhood belltown is home to many delectable restaurants
the staff is friendly and helpful we had to alter our itinerary due to a minor setback and the staff was able to accomodate our changes seamlessly we were afforded early checkin at arrival and the front desk was knowledgeable in answering our questions we did dine in the attached cafe while it was busy our server was attentive and quick the fare hit the spot and is reasonably priced
because of the location of our room we did not hear the various construction projects outside we did hear our neighbor briefly but that was a fluke as they raised their voices to an unneighborly level we overheard that the hotel was at capacity but the hotel was refreshingly quiet despite it
i did comparison shop for hotels before our stay and hotel five seattle consistently beat comparable boutique hotels price wise from my experience youll be pleasantly surprised by the superb hospitality provided by the hotel i will definitely return to hotel five during my next visit to seattle",5.0
nothing wrong with arlington except a bit of building work,"my boyfriend and i stayed at the arlington for 10 nights starting march 21 after seeing the reviews over the last month we were serious considering changing hotels but after contacting the travel agent who contacted the hotel to see what the building situation was we decided to keep the reservation when we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and given a really lovely large room on the 11th floor 1107 which had a view of the empire state building from the bathroom was newly decorated and very clean and fresh yes the towels are small but the hotel is cheap and you could buy a big towel for less than 10 in a cheap store if you were really that bothered the building work was still ongoing throughout our stay but it was mostly painting so the lifts were never out of use although when we left on the 31st there was heavy building work going on in the lobby behind a partition wall 
we were asked to change rooms after 2 nights because they wanted to replace and paint the doors on the landing we were on which was a bit of a nuisance but it would have been worse to stay on that landing through the building work and they extended our check out time to compensate for the time spent moving
the new room was 1107 which was to the same standard but without the view every day the room was cleaned and all the towels were replaced we had use of a safe and fridge and had an adaquate sized wardrobe but only 6 hangers 
throughout our ten nights you could not notice the noise from outside the hotel which ive never experienced before in my 5 previous stays in nyc in other hotels the hotel staff were friendly and helpful to us and we never felt unsafe in our room or on the street outside even late at night the location is great really convenient for lots of places try the food at la caterers beside the subway and 5th ave clock you wont regret it
i would definately stay at this hotel again although i expect it wont be so cheap once all the building work is finished",3.0
good location dated rooms okay service,"stayed here overnight because i had an early meeting in baltimore and couldnt afford travel delays due to weather the location is great  right between the northern edge of the inner harbor area and the piers on the edge of harbor east the rooms are comfortable but standard and a little dated we were there one night after the hurricane so it was pretty empty which might explain the one service debacle there was no one at the front desk for more than 10 minutes we would have left and gone somewhere else but the room was prepaid so we were stuck we had to wander around looking for a staff person to check us in when we finally found him he was pleasant enough but perfunctory and not at all apologetic about being mia
all in all if the rate is cheap id stay here in the future id never pay full rate for this place with the marriott and the four seasons immediately adjacent with comparable rates",3.0
horrible service,i stayed there on business at the end of june every time i stay there the computers are down when you go to check out and it takes days of calling to obtain a bill this time they told me that they would email a bill by 800 am in the morning of course this never happened i have been calling to try to obtain an invoice but they take an attitude with you when you ask for the bill and want you to keep calling back i tried express check out once and when the charges came through my credit card there were all these extras which took me forever to rectify with the hotel dealing with this attitude is tiring and is not even close to being good customer service at a minimum it seems like a hotel should be able to provide a copy of an accurate bill to its customers they talk over you and raise their voice i have learned my lesson and will be staying somewhere else in the future where i can receive an accurate and timely copy of the charges without having to beg for it,1.0

bed head central,"the front desk employees are desperately in need of training in gratiously greeting their guests and providing pleasant costumer service during their stay the housekeeping staff and the valet were the complete oppositeshelpful and most accommodating the rooms were incredibly heavy with bedroom odoriebed head i had to spray perfume on my pillow to block out the odor yuck i asked for new pillows at the front desk and was abruptly told i could find extras in the closet guess whatno pillows in the closet and no pillow replacements were provided after informing the front desk that there were no pillows in the closet
the bathtub was half full of water by the time i finished my shower yuck again and the hairdryer is a joke it died after a minutei suggest you take your own
it was so hot in the room that it was ridiculousand this is november a couple in the elevator with us said they thought they were in a steam bath all night and no satifation with the front desk in remedying the situation

good value for a place to rest your head,i stayed at the corktown inn while working a promo job for the belle isle grand prix as a solo female traveler i would recommend this place its not the nicest place but its cheap clean enough and the staff is nice after reading some reviews i had my doubts especially arriving at 1am but the room was clean and i never felt unsafe in the 4 nights i stayed the only downsides were the old school cigarette smell that permeated everything and the incredibly thin walls between rooms overall it did the job and i plan on staying there every time i work in detroit,3.0

big surprise in small package,the price is right the location is good and the service is outstandingyou are located in the shopping district but just a cable carbus walk away from chinatownnorth beachand fishermans wharf tip there is no place to park and it is expensive to do so if you do not need to do not this is where the mosser stands out the mosser staff would see me ask me where i was going and assist me in my plans for the day by directing me on how to get there by using bus cable car train or the subway it was a lot cheaper than parking and often quicker than using the car because hard to find a place to park they also provided toothpaste and a razor besides the regular shampoo and soap,4.0

dissapointing and dirty,"i travel about 25 timesyear for business and stay mainly in hilton family embassy suites or marriott family hotels
lobby area was average not terribly pleasant but fine as soon as i walked into my room i almost did a double take and walked back out was 41 which is at the end of the hallway and not only was it much smaller than i had expected the furnishing were outdated drab dirty and in disrepair i arrived at dinner hour and was checking out before 7am the next morning so all i was looking for was fresh clean pleasant
the furniture was so old and outdated and just didnt make sense in the room the tv was perched on such a low bureau and situated next to the bed not head on so it was almost impossible to watch tv from the bed the sofa looked like worn dorm furniture being that i travel a lot for business i am not terribly germ phobic but this was the first room which made me feel squeamish the carpet felt like indooroutdoor carpet i had to move the curtain to allow the ac to circulate and when i picked up the curtains they were very dirty and dingy yuck 2 out of the 4 lights in the room did not work and the other blinked erratically 
the kicker was that the toilet didnt flush best part of this stay was leaving for my meeting at 7am the next day
understand the convenient location and all but as there are at least 3 other hotels in the complex i would certaintly recommend to my colleagues to avoid this one
sorry marriott this one just isnt up to par felt much more like a motel and for the same  as the marriott oak brook where i usually stay was just a joke im glad this wasnt coming out of my own pocket",2.0
loving the marmara,well what can i say i have been too manhattan three times and i can safely say this is the best accommodation i have stayed in the apartment we had was fantastic no central park view but hey how long do you spend in your apartment a couple of blocks from the maramra is a little restaurant and bar called the barking dog food is fantastic and so is the price great service apart from one time you will find it at 150 e 34th st try it out you are about 6 blocks away from central park and 5th avenue not far from the museums there is a store across the road from the marmara that sells all the essentials you need a fantastic stay will stay again here next time,5.0

too many other places in san diego,i would skip too many other places to stay in san diego with better prices and atomsphere we were looking for a hawaiian themed hoteland this was not it we did have a room right on the marina but the room smelled like a motel 6 room i would rate this hotel about a 25  definitely not a resort the decor is definitely outdated and the breakfast with the aaa rate is not worth the deal the front lobby clerk processes checkin onlyunconcerned with giving you the usual spiel about where to find the internet access code or that the aaa breakfast is ordered off a special menu and you must notify your server ahead of time the rooms lead out to concrete hallways and the walls are paperthindefinitely not resort material  especially by san diego standards,3.0
standard clean rooms in a convenient location,our small room was quite clean and equipped with a comfortable bed the price makes it a good value though for some 20 more one can stay in a much higher quality hotel in the times square area the lack of a spacious lobby is a drawback as is the low elevator capacity that results in waiting time going up and down from the rooms the breakfast in the pleasant restaurant was very good with prompt attentive service,3.0
best place in town,this is our second stay here and it was better this time because we knew how great it was going to be the staff was all so friendly and helpful its tricky to pick just one person who was the best  but i would have to say  william was at the front desk i do best with some special accommodations such as no cleaning scents in my room and the staff for the second time in a row had the room clean but fragrance free and the windows open for me upon my arrival to anyone with asthma or chemical sensitivities reading this you know how amazing it is to travel and be able to breathe my family and many others with us on this visit love the character of the sainte claire a bonusyou can walk anywhere including a beautiful park and relax or go out,5.0
one really great night out,my husband and i had a wonderful romantic night out with our stay at this hotel the customer service at the hotel proper was very helpful and friendly the food at 42 degrees north restaurant in hotel was fantastic though the servers were a bit on the lackluster side not very professional for such a nice place our room was very comfortable minus the mattress which felt a bit old dipped in the center but linens and pillows very comfy they use bath and bodyworks bath and shower products in the bathroom  very nice touch the view from our room was breathtaking being close to the riverwalk and all kinds of downtown fun was great we cant wait to go back and would recommend it to our friends looking for a date night,4.0

carefully examine your bill,"i actually wanted to give this property 25 stars because of the inaccurate room description but it is not possible
we stayed at the residence inn vermont ave for 3 nights february 2012 i booked the room at this hotel because i needed a one bedroom suite with two beds upon checking in i was given a room with two beds and a kitchendiningliving area but no bedroom door i immediately went back to the front desk and requested a room with a bedroom door the clerk was nice and offered me another room buti was informed that there were no suites with two beds that had a bedroom door even though i booked and eventually paid for a one bedroom suite i actually paid more than i wouldve for a suite with a door because i requested two beds everyone at the hotel acted like it was okay to advertise a one bedroom even if the bedroom has no door no concession was offered 
thankfully my 4 year old was fairly quiet in the mornings
additionally even if you do not use the valet you are immediately billed for all the nights of your stay if you have a car the front desk staff agreed to remove one of the charges from the bill we had to ask two additional times to have it removed 
other than the false advertisment about the one bedroom suite and the valet bill issue it was a nice hotel with a good location if i had not been traveling with my family the door would not have mattered it was a large room
breakfast was great with a waffle machine some eggs and other hot items they had all premium condiments including flavored coffee creamers and splenda and equal there were also continental items yogurt cereal breads and juice and soda machines the breakfast staff is very accommodating the eggs were somewhat runny but i know some people like them that way
the workout facility is very nice
housekeeping was excellent the hotel staff was friendly except for one argumentative valet porter
the mcpherson square metro is a few blocks away cabs are abundant stans a pub down the street has decent food and very real drinks
i wouldve given the hotel a higher rating if i had gotten what i paid for",3.0
probably wont be a sheraton for long,lobby area was dark and uninviting the former ramada did have a make over but it seems like more money could have been invested i paid 66 a night for the room on a priceline bid at that price it was a bargain but at full price i would have felt cheated my stay was over the weekend and there were a lot of guests in town for different celebrations the halls and corridors were not kept as clean as possible some of that was the guests fault and not the hotels a room service tray was left on the hall on the third floor of the south tower and some guests decided to scatter the left overs across the carpet room was comfortable but the window was small and the view was of the freeway bathroom was small in comparasion to the room size self parking is outside on a surface lot valet parking is covered and worth the extra expense,3.0
i thought i had moved into a starbucks,"being from the great northwest home of starbucks i was amused when i entered the lobby of the hyatt place it was obviously designed to have that coffeehouse look in fact the checkin counter is also a starbucks counter i am not sure if its an actual starbucks franchise but they serve many of the starbucks drinks 
after a long day of travel i arrived at the hotel the check in was pretty easy but the hostess wanted to sell me on some kind of plan to reduce costs for me and my companyat that point i wanted to get to my room and crash she was gracious when i told her id talk with her later 
i was staying here while working up in st marys georgia about 30 minutes away because of long work hours i didnt really get a chance to experience all the hotel had to offer 
the room was very comfortable and included a large flat screen tv with a connection interface box to satisfy the latent geek in anyone there was a large couch a desk and a coffee area with refrigerator wish they also had a microwave the bed was extremely comfortable and had an offering of a variety of pillows with different firmness characteristics 
the free breakfast was delicious and offered some bistro style egg dishes each morning the juice was good and cold the coffee was not very hot but was remedied by the person over the breakfast area i especially liked the fresh fruit salad with large chunks of pineapple
this place was a great value and very comfortable the staff was friendly for the most part the only downside to the stay was room cleanliness it was pretty obvious that my room was not being vacuumed each day however other things were well maintained
one funny little perkthey provide you with a new tube trial size of toothpaste everyday i wish all hotels did thisjust one less thing to pack in my quart size ziplock tsa liquid bag",4.0
super trendy hotel awesome location,i was so nervous about getting this hotel on a bid after reading the reviews but the hotel ended up being awesome yes the rooms are tiny if you are going to spend a lot of time in the room opt for another place we came here to relax for an hour and sleep at night 2 adults and a 3yo and it was perfectly fine the staff were nice the decor was great the room was clean i really have no complaints we requested a higher up floor which by the way makes no difference in outside sounds and they accommodated us with no issue dont be put off by the negative reviews it seems as though they added lighting to the rooms they werent dark like the other reviews said the lobby is dark and the hallways are dark but we never found it to be an issue its in an amazing location half a block to the 59stcolumbus circle subway and just as close to central park there are 2 parking garages on the street central and icon print out a coupon online and its 1520 cheaper than their 55 valet at the hotel,5.0
great room great location,"this property is a real find if like me youve had enough of corporate midtown hotels
you just have a room and a key  no concierge  bar  restaurant etc so its more like staying in someones house although you can order room service from the bar next door
the decor is quirky and quaint  shabby chic meets victoriana  the bathroom is particularly unusual with a old claw footed tub and brass taps
we stayed in december and were grateful for the fire that you can light as you wish gas with flames not real wood  it really adds ambiance to an already spacious room
the usual amenities and mini bar are on offer with a few thoughtful extras like maps
the location is great as well  easy walking distance into soho and of course the lovely bowery just around the corner for drinks
this place is edgy and cool and beats more traditional hotels hands down
only criticisms would be that the tv was very old and it took us a long time to get any channels on it at all and also the ipod dock  alarm clock didnt work  but technology didnt really seem appropriate in our oldschool room anyway",4.0
room was small but staff were very friendly and helpful,"i got to the hotel early 11am so i could spend the day out with my friend in manhattan i didnt get any sleep on my long flight with a layover in atlanta so i was actually falling asleep in the lobby waiting for my friend to come meet me the front desk staff was very nice in offering early checkins for me and another couple that were waiting for checkin time 3pm i gladly took what was available so i could get a much needed nap before exploring the city the elevator was busy with housekeeping using the 1 elevator but i still didnt wait too long for it to be available for me to use the housekeepers were friendly while i passed them by to get to my room one of them even helped to make sure that my room was ready before i walked ion the room and bringing an extra blanket that she found missing the room was very small but was very cozy at the end of the rooms hallway was one of the beds was very close to the wall and was obstructing passage to go around the bed i have a picture of the bed near the wall and blocking the hallway but all and all a nice small room there were robes and nice bath amenities  which i gladly took home for a future bath or shower the lotions and soaps not the robes the tv was small and didnt have many stations available but i didnt care since i was there to go out and be entertained by the city i got a quiet room without a view which was perfectly quiet for me to take a nap and slept well later that night the front desk in the morning were very nice and expedient they also asked if i needed transportation and would help me if needed the hotel is just across the street from central park if i moved here i think this would be a nice neighborhood to live in 
it felt safe there were cafes and shops within 3 to 4 blocks and the hotel is half a block away from a bus stop and the subway its very convenient i would recommend this hotel to someone who spending the day out and not staying in the room much although i think its still cozy you will have easy access to public transportation and will get a good night sleep at night the price was the cheapest that i could find at the time i would tell you what it is but its irrelevant since room rates will change throughout manhattan depending on the time of your trip oh okay it was 14700 inc taxes and fees",4.0
classy with great service in a great location,always a pleasure at a fairmont property service was top notch we were there for a long weekend and to attend a seahawks game location was great we walked to pike place market shopping  cool restaurants nearby there was a nice little bar in the hotel for a nightcap and we ordered room service for breakfast one day which was great  tasty  fast but pricey it is not a hip hotel like the hyatt is but more a classy and comfy vibe we were upgraded to a suite with a comfortable sitting area the furniture was a little like grandmas living roomand the room smelled slightly musty when we first walked in overall it was really very nice the doorman were very polite friendly and helpful it was a great spot for us to be at for the weekend seattle is a great city and the fairmont olympic a great place to sty,4.0
can not sleep very loud door banging all nights long,"this hotel is clean conveniently located with friendly staff and you do get a breakfast of powedered eggs for free however all the advantages fade out  when you can not get a good nights sleep
hotel is in a tall and thin building elevator is located in the center surrounded by 8 guest rooms on each floor your door is maximum 15 feet away from the elevator so you can hear people coming and going all night and they do come home at all hours loud and excited
also rooms doors close with a very loud metal bang very loud 
so last night for example the last loud group came inaround 130 at night first elevator doors open they come out laughing and carrying on waking you up and in the morning i was waken up at 6 am with a guest leaving his room and the door closing with a bang
i will not stay here again and would not recommend it suggestion for management would be to sound proof the rooms better eliminate the loud banging door noise and perhaps to install a sign on the inside of elevator doors and in the hallways saying please be quiet other guests are resting",1.0
very nice i would recommend,my husband and i spent one night at the magnolia july 23rd the staff was very friendly the location is perfect if you plan on taking in some theater or maybe a show at the toyaota center they even offer transportation he had a suite it was big comforatble and clean my only small issue is that the tv could have used an update to a flat screen rm 1901,4.0
good value for the area,this hotel is not the nicest hilton ive stayed in the location is good if you need to be in the union square area when looking at a map of the union square area be aware that the entrance to this hotel is on ofarrell it is a little hike to get to the heart of the union square shopping area although the location is on the border of the tenderloin neighborhood i did feel safe coming and going there are doormen who are always there and a security guard outside sometimes we took advantage of the loaner umbrellas that they offered and they were large and highquality the room service is very expensive for below average quality food and i would not recommend it the business center is a kinkos you need to pay to use the computers i paid 4 dollars worth of computer time to print my boarding pass,3.0
nice cozy hotelwith great staff,"this hotel is very cozy feeling and is great if you want to be near the water or in the pikes market area only a 10 minute walk my room was suppose to be a city view room but when i checked in they upgraded me to a water view room it didnt have the tub that you see in the pictures but it had a great rock and glass walk in shower the beds seem to be very comfortable at least for me the decoration of the hotel is a little kitchy sp but cute i felt like i was in a lodge or a place that should be in fhe forest the fire place was a nice touch i didnt use it because i was in seattle on one of those off days in june when the weather was actually great and some what warm 
the staff at the edgewater were very helpful and accomodating they were able to help me with many of my questions or issues that i had unrelated to the hotel i bought fish at pikes market and they were very quick to make sure it was well preserved until i was ready to check  out i was easily able to connect to the wireless network that they have available through the hotel 
the location of this hotel is great for anyone that may be taking the clipper to canada the dock is right next door to the hotel and they will even help you with your luggage to the ferry very accomodating
i would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to people who want to stay on or near the water in seattle and near pikes market if you go to pikes market and enjoy cheese there is a great place called beechers they have the best soups and mac and cheese ever",4.0
vastly overrated,it is hard to believe that a hotel with double occupancy 125sq foot single double bed rooms could possibly be rated as four stars it questions the validity of the entire star rating system for the omni chain a chain generally associated with upscale accommodations to associate itself with such a hotel is mind boggling this is a hotel that is clearly stuck in the ninteenth century any modern four star hotel evaluation includes the designation spacious room not here this is really a fraudulent use of the star system and an embarassment to the omni chain,2.0
decent hotel tough parking lot to enter and exit,"not a bad place i was satisfied with my stay 
check in
no problems and i was right off to my room
bed
i liked the bed like usual the major problems was the pillows they always seem to have these pillows that are worthless to me i had to pile 3 to get a decent pillow
shower
the shower was not that great in my room plus its weird its not labeled well so it took some trial and error to get the hot water 
tv
decent tv and decent amount of channels they did have some hd channels
fitness room
it had a great fitness room at one point there was 5 people in there and we all had something to use
parking
the hotel is on the point of 2 main roads so its a bit hard to enter and exit if there is heavy traffic 
internet
decent signal during my visit 
overall i was happy i did walk run across the street for dinner they had a good selection of decent places over there",4.0
comfortable rooms amazing location,i stayed here when attending a conference up the street at the omni the normandy was less expensive and tenfold as nice the rooms are thoughtfully and elegantly appointed the beds are comfortable the bathrooms large many boutique hotels tend to be heavy on the attitude but light on the amenities and comfort not here one complaint the staff while polite and attentive was very slow to answer my emails and i had to ask three or four times and wait five days for a confirmation to be sent to my email address,5.0

its a marriott,"all in all its a nice hotel our room was nice clean and just what we expected from a marriott we did not eat any food at the hotel so i cant speak for that if you want to be close to the water and the piers its a great location also very close to the pike place market and some other neighborhoods worth checking out of course you are paying for the water front location two things i really didnt like 1 the cost of parking however if you go a couple blocks past the marriott and turn on bell or wall you will find a municpal garage says for cruises but anyone can park there for 14 a day 10day if you have a cruise receipt its about a 4 block walk back to the hotel but if you prefer to pay 42 a day for valet knock yourself out 2 12 a day for internet really in this day an age when nearly every cheap hotel offers it for free im gonna pay top dollar to stay at the marriott waterfront and you want to insult me by charging for internet i just find that so tacky
anyway enjoy your visit and enjoy seattle lots to do and see",4.0
beautiful hotel with fun ghostly lore,the brown palace was a gorgeous hotel within walking distance of plenty of shopping and a mall i didnt realize there were tours but heard a nearby tour party discussing some of the eerie fun ghost stories from the hotel the tour guide was even dressed in old fashioned costume to fit the tale i wish i could have stayed for the tea service it looked lovelydefinitely next time very comfortable bed nice views and great prime rib at this hotel very helpful and friendly staff as well definitely worth staying here,5.0
great hotel to stay though wish the mgt more flexible w lugguage policy,"stay 1 night on sept 3 2009 using the priority club points as we had to join a tour in the nearby chinatown the next day and the location of this hotel from the pick up point is about 4 blocks away everyone is very nice upon check in as my 3 yrs old daughter was crying out loud her heart to learn that we didnt stay in sheraton laguardia as we did the previous 2 nights but here i was really embarrassed but the check in staff was fanstastic came out and tried to calm her down but futile beat me sometimes todlers are so sensitive   passionate about the hotel that they once stayed 
the only complaint that i have is that the hotel will not hold our luggage for 2 nights if we dont have a future reservation and quoted us due to liability and suggested that we stored our lugguage in penn station this is a crazy suggestion as we arrived in the late evening that night and will have no time to travel to penn station that night as we only need to store 1 piece so that the next morning we didnt need to drag 2 pieces of luggage when we joined our 3 days 2 nights tour to philly washington dcniagara falls and thousand island we explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on 3rd day to jersey city and would this change no sorry that is the reply i found this very discrimating as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay otherwise once your stay is over sorry you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem in my prior stay of hotel like sheraton vancouver they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding  this is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at penn station so apart from this issue of not able to hold our 1 piece luggage since we have no pending reservation which i found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an unhelpful hotel meeting guest needs
overall room is clean and comfortable as they put us on club floor and indeed no street noise or subway train vibrations staff are friendly  helpful apart from the incident that not able to hold our 1 piece luggage for 2 nights even though we booked with them the car service upon our return
i would still recommend this hotel stay to friend and family though would advise them to take into consideration the no luggage hold if there is no future reservation with them",4.0
not normal sheraton quality bay tower,"this tower is fairly average the view and location however are outstanding restaurant is more like convenience cafe very small and limited menu beds suck guess they havent upgraded to new cozy ones toilet paper and tissue are cheap and scratchy details that add to feeling of nice detail or am i in motel 6 front desk staff was friendly but a bit too much to the point for my taste i like the is there anything else and other courtesies took 3 calls and 2 visits to front front desk over 4 hour period to get corkscrew and room service menu delivered i called guest services made my request only to hear allow me to transfer you to room servicedid this 3 timesnever got connected just wonder why he didnt send it up 
room service and bar staff are super friendly and food was tasty",3.0
wonderful experience,"id start by saying typical marriott which isnt a bad thing but this hotel really really has its act together and its better than a typical marriott wonderfully efficient checkin people courteous shuttle bus driver and attentive staff all the way around
were extremely lowmaintenance guests we check in and ideally you never hear from us again until we check out marriott delivers and an absolutely perfect stay all hotels should be this good
thoroughly recommend this property if youre thinking of visiting phoenix although havent stayed at enough hotels in phoenix to suggest this as a base especially if you want spas and a resort experience no one ever chooses to stay at an airport hotel unless theres a great reason to stay at an airport hotel such a business meeting or an early morning flight out the next morning
excellent rooms wonderful concierge lounge and really really really quiet airport is about a five minute drive away

nice atmosphere great location but small rooms,"i liked this hotel booked through priceline so got a good rate 90 but would definitely consider returning even if i had to pay more
room was small as you would expect at a boutique hotel the whole building shows its age with a few cracks here and there but is very clean decor is in keeping with the style of the hotel it was on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel you can definitely hear the street noise but i am not a light sleeper so it didnt bother me the alternative seemed to be rooms at the back with views of brick walls so if a quiet room with a view is a priority for you this might not be the best place
location is great  right in the center of things lobby is always full of bustle in all the place had much more character than the business hotels i generally end up staying at service was good  everybody i spoke to was very pleasant and attentive
nice place but not ultraluxury by any means",4.0

will stay here again,we enjoyed our stay a the bay club hotel overall it was a good experience the rooms and hotel are clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful they offer a buffetstyle complimentary breakfast which was ok we ate breakfast 2 days there but after we went out for breakfast the fitness room over looks the marina but honestly we enjoyed walkingjogging along the bay much better the equipment is a bit outdated we discovered after the first full day there that you have to call the front desk to arrange your room to be serviced but after that was pleasantly surprised when they came in thereafter on a daily basis without the phone call all in all a good experience and we will definately stay again,4.0
youre paying for location,"one spends a lot of money to stay at this hotel in return one gets a super location if theater is on the agenda however even when paying 400 or more nightly one has to ask for a fridge to be placed in your room need a shower cap one has to request that also want to log onto the internet in your room you can get it for a mere 19 a day tax included our rooms decor was classic hotel standard comfortably innocuous but large 
 all in all the beancounters have sucked the luxury and welcome out of this hotel at no sacrifice to the bottomline call me cheap but i think at these prices the hotels save a couple of bucksapproach is bush league",3.0
great deal in the theatre district but,"the location is greateasy walking distance to the theatres millennium park and the art institute
the price is goodcheaper than other properties in the same neighborhood
if youre on a budget skip the valet parking and park in the garage on the opposite corner of randolph and wells and save 14 skip coffee delivered to your door dunkin donuts is across the street on wells
the staff is pleasant if somewhat confused at times the room was small but within acceptable limits for the location and price
there was one thing missing from the room an electrical outlet there was one that was not behind furniture in the small bathroom what good is an iron and an ironing board when the only place to iron is in the bathroom while standing in the tub
while the property was recently renovated expect to be mildly annoyed by the small things the ipod dock was broken the tv didnt work well with the instream receiver there are ice machine rooms on the even floors but the one on 10 was an empty room the computer center next to the front desk had a broken printer on the other hand the wireless network worked well
verdict great deal for a short stay to see a few shows but plan to obtain services by walking around the neighborhood",3.0
great location tiny roomsthin walls,"san francisco  the hardest place on our trip to choose a hotel that sounded like it would be safe and quiet after scoping over all the trip advisor reviews on san fran hotels it became apparent that chancellor was the only choice  what attracted me also was the fact that if there were any negative parts of a review  management would come on trip advisor and try and explain the why  it shows they have a lot of self respect for their customer service
when we arrived we were served by professional and friendly staff who gave us vouchers for a drink in the bar later on which also had friendly people serving we were taken up to our room and soon after the fridge i had order for medical reasons arrived  only problem was someones left over ice cream was still in there but i was happy that is arrived so quickly after we arrived unlike other establishments with poor service
let me begin with the room  in a country where its all about big  these rooms were tiny  but in saying that that is what you should expect from a boutique hotel the beds were single beds  quite small and soft theres a bay window that looked out onto the street below where we watched a busker outside our hotel getting rowdier and rowdier as the day went on  this is not a hotel you want to be in if you want to keep the windows open lol  unless u like noise with the windows closed i didnt find it at all too noisy the bathroom perhaps needs a face lift as the new feature wall and bed linen in the main room has given it a great look but for all intent purposes was fine free wireless internet was fabulous and fast apart from being small  the rooms were clean and comfortable
biggest flaw with the rooms  the extremely thin walls in the middle of the night we were awoken and kept awake by noises that well were a tad r rated  with a 5am wake up call the next day we were a bit tired the following day
location location union square is right there  shopping district surrounds you and the cable cars ding ding at your front door step tour buses are easily booked and acessible from the chancellor restaurants and food places are just a hop skip and a jump away my personal favourite  bangkok noodles and thai bbq  110 powell st  yummy fried rice actually  best ive ever had
stay at chancellor for the location and the service ",4.0
fabulous location,we got a great deal on a discount website 90 a night other reviewers are correct in saying that the rooms as very small but we had a corner room with three windows which probably made a huge difference as the other rooms on our floor only had one small window with a window unit air conditioner those rooms could have felt a little cell like but our was certainly adequate for just sleeping and showering it has a lovely roof top deck with lots of seating the work out facility is small two treadmills one bike one eliptical weights and a pulley station its abt a 5 minutes straight shot to the beachabt 10 minutes to navy pier a one block walk to michigan avenue at ohio there are plenty of restaurants within a couple of blocks the location couldnt have been better i highly recommend it for its location and roof top deck if i wanted a beautiful room with lots of room and a spa like bath then i wouldnt recommend it but if youre just looking for location convenience and a good price then this is the place,4.0

marina tower only,we used hotelscom to book our 5 night stay at this hotel and had chosen a marina view as opposed to a bay view however there are two towers at this hotel and they are quite different the marina tower is far superior to the bay tower which they had booked us into we asked to be moved to the marina tower which they did with no complaint and after bring placed in two unacceptable rooms we were upgraded to a gorgeous room on the 9th floor of 12 the marina tower has all the facilities which the bay tower does not ie two pools fitness center bike and segway rentals bars and restaurants including starbucks and is far newer than the bay tower we ate at their restaurants each night and had great servers you can have valet parking or use public transit from this hotel valet 2000 day vs transit 500 day san diego has a wonderful history and the downtown core is quite newwe recommend taking a trolley tour to get an overview if you havent been there beforethe beds and pillows were heavenly and we had a balcony with two chairs and a table,5.0

through all of my travels and stays at hotels i have never experienced such a complete disregard for customers and their needs and the worse part it was that although id tried to reach the manager of the hotel ronica throughout my stay each time i was given a response that she hadnt arrived at work this being 1000am on friday morning or that shed already left at 430pm on the same day and when id asked whether she would be in during the weekend the receptionist only responded by telling me that she doesnt really have a fixed schedule",1.0

excellent hotel with a very courteous staff,"excellent first rate hotel with a very courteous staff
we checked in for our anniversary in octoberr and were told that the hotel was overbooked  and that they did not have a room in the bay tower that night  however they did find a last minute accommodation for the night and then upgraded us to the penthouse suite for the next 2 nights  it was excellent service all around after that the front desk went out of their way to make this happen and they had no incentive to do it for us  they could have very well given us another room  i believe the person on the front desk that night was eduardo but i do not recollect his name it was a 2000sq ft penthouse and the huge balcony has excellent views of the san diego skyline the marina is just steps away from the hotel and you can plan to watch a romantic sunset by the oceanside in rather silence also we were given free parking and breakfast vouchers for all 3 days of our stay  now that was surely a royal treatment thanks for making it a special vacation for us we left a small bottle of champagne as a token of appreciation",5.0

perfect inexpensive neighborhood hotel  best hotel value for  in nyc,two of us stayed for 5 nights at the end of march in a room 217 with a single and double bed and couldnt have been more pleased i wanted to stay in a neighborhood setting and not spend much money because we would hardly ever be in our room we shared a bathroom right across the hall which worked perfectly  we never saw anyone else use it  it was spotless and there was a sink  hairdryer and two mirrors in our room the lobby was quaint and i loved all the dark wood trim throughout we laughed about the fact that the only noise we heard in our room came from birds in the morning  no traffic noise the room looked better than what we saw on the website wed stay there again for sure,5.0

fivestar service  threestar rooms  fourstar review,"september 6th through 8th 2005  this was my first stay at this marriott hotel i will likely return
i arrived early evening and checkin took only a minute or two i received my guaranteed room type king nonsmoking my room was 405 in the older 5story section of the hotel the room was pretty average but i liked it because the sliding glass door opened onto the front of the hotel and it was very quiet i intended to sleep with the sliding glass door open
the room had a nice two level work desk with an stsn ibahn hs internet connection i had trouble accessing the system but was finally able to get online however the system worked only intermittently after several calls to the help line a hotel engineer arrived at my room with several new boxes none of them worked and i would up changing rooms
my second room 583 was on the concierge level 5th floor and was also a nonsmoking king room before i did anything else i checked to make sure the internet connection worked properly which it did i did not notice it until i finished my work but this room was on the back of the hotel and faced i25 i am a light sleeper and the noise from the interstate meant that i did not get a good night sleep
the next morning i stopped by the front desk and said that i would need to change rooms again my request was handled quickly but there were no king nonsmoking rooms available i wound up with room 7308 in the newer tower section of the hotel i did not like this room as much as either of the others because it had a much smaller desk did not have a worktype chair at the desk and the windows would not open
common to all three rooms was a unit that housed an empty compact refrigerator and a coffee maker the bathrooms were small but spotless there were plenty of thick white towels all of the rooms had the type of single room air conditioners that are not as quiet as wholehouse systems they worked well but were somewhat noisy
one of the best features of this hotel in my opinion was the marquis lounge equivalent to the concierge lounge in most marriott hotels the lounge was very large and comfortable in the evening there were three different hot appetizers chili and a nice selection of fruit and cheeses i ate enough that i considered it my dinner in the morning there was a nice continental breakfast plus scrambled eggs there is complimentary wireless internet access in the lounge
for dinner my second night i decided to eat a full meal in comparis the full service restaurant the food and service were excellent it was one of the best and most enjoyable meals that i have had in a while a glass of premium wine salad pasta entrée desert and coffee came to 40 with tax jam my waiter gave truly excellent service and he looks a lot like al pacino the restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch also but i only had dinner
the rooms in the older section of the hotel are built around a 5story atrium odd number rooms face outward and most of the even number rooms open onto the atrium within the atrium is the great divide brewing company a bar and lounge right off of the atrium is the front range trading company which is a combination gift shop and starbucks
the health club is at the back of the hotel the exercise room was quite large and had a good selection of equipment that all looked in excellent condition the indoor pool area that also has a whirlpool spa is adjacent just out side is the outdoor pool there were plenty of clean towels in both the exercise room and the pool areas
there is a display in the lobby of what the rooms will look like after they are refurbished early in 2006 my guess is that the rooms will go from being comfortable but boring to very comfortable and beautiful
there is plenty of free parking all around the hotel as well as valet parking for which i think there is a charge walking through the lobby i was constantly asked by hotel associates if they could help me or direct me the service at this hotel is excellent
the denver marriott tech center is located at the junction of i225 and i25 it is almost exactly 26 miles from denver international airport the hotel is located in a business park with a few restaurants there is a fedex kinkos across the street
i can highly recommend this hotel for the service the rooms are very clean and comfortable but nothing special i am anxious to see this property after the rooms get an extreme makeover in 2006",4.0
stayed there before will stay there again,"i stayed at the hampton inn times square north last year and rebooked for my trip this year could not beat the price for the location and ammenities
i was greeted with a welcome back and an early checkin to a room at the end of the hall on a high floor just as i had requested my room faced 8th ave and to be honest i was not bothered by street noise at all i would rather have the 8th ave view too
the staff here are really warm and helpful they are also professional and friendly i had a problem with a slow drain and it was fixed by the time i got back to my room
the rooms are large and comfortable i used the safe everyday and i always felt secure even staying alone here 
i will definitely stay here again on my next trip to the city",5.0
would have been great if the airport shuttle had been on time,"i really liked this hotel when i first checked in the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming and i thought the decor was quite nice for a doubletree the room we were assigned was spacious and the bed was comfortable i did not have a chance to use it but the pool looked like fun
anyway i stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to the airport as i had a 700am flight out of san antonio the next morning i asked for information on the shuttle as i checked in the front desk agent stated that we should be in the lobby just 15 minutes before we wanted to be at the airport as it is just a few minutes away in the morning i went downstairs 15 minutes before i needed to be at the airport the front desk agent called the shuttle driver multiple times and could not get in touch with him the shuttle was parked in front of the hotel so it was just a matter of the driver coming to the lobby it took forever the front desk agent was so nice  even offered to pay for a cab in the end we had to wait in the lobby for 30 minutes to get the shuttle and were at the airport about 40 minutes from the time we arrived in the lobby i was livid and almost missed my flight granted one might suggest i pad some extra time to get to the airport but my reason for staying at an airport hotel was so that i could sleep in a bit it was just so frustrating
all in all my experience with the airport shuttle was a real damper on my experience with this hotel otherwise i would have rated the property much higher bottom line if you are an airport hotel make sure your shuttle is running on time",3.0

crazy good service and great location ill book again for sure,"great stay we arrived early in the day and since our rooms were not ready we checked our bags we all received phone calls when our rooms were ready im a hilton gold member so upon arrival to my room i received a hand written welcome note with a bag of complimentary snacks and water in lieu of a room upgrade as no such upgrade was available the rooms are spacious for nyc and seemed recently renovated very clean and up to date we opted for the bed  breakfast deal which got our day off to a good start i was happy to see that breakfast was served in the adjoining restaurant pigalle as i have had numerous good dinners there before i was very happy about the free internet and the mp3 hook up to the alarm clock its pretty easy to pick up cabs from the hotel and there are great restaurants on the surrounding blocks 
my only word of caution would be to ask for a room on a high floor so you dont hear the traffic i was on 9 and could still hear quite a lotbut this is new york and is to be expected my coworkers were on lower floors and their only complaint is that they were close to the ice machine and elevators so you may want to ask for the best room available away from noisemaking things
the staff aim to please they seem to want to bend over backwards to make things right everything was right in my opinion so i didnt need to call on them 
did i mention they have cookies at checkin

very comfortable hotel close to shopping at arboretum and the domain,"we spent 7 nights here and enjoyed our stay the room was very comfortable the hotel is close to excellent shopping and restaurants and located in a park so very quiet despite the busy neighborhood
to the posters complaining about smoke were smokers and appreciate that we can get a smoking room most hotels no longer have smoking rooms if the odor of smoke the idea of smoke is so upsetting to you stay in a nonsmoking hotel there is one right next door to the homewood suites

good location good price lowsy staff beware personal belongings,"good things
the location was great macys plaza one block from metro station7th ralphs around the corner buy breaky or lunch to go at a decent price and get pharmacy stuff the area seemed clean and harmless even at my very early arrival on saturday am although my local friends freaked out at the downtown location being dangerous
walking distance to staples center and area good location for concert stay
photographs seemed true to what i experienced
several coffee shops around the corner for a decent breaky including a famous one i cant recall that had huge lines on a saturday morning and dennys were i ended up 
the price was at its lower end so in all a value 
the location is visited by a lot of young europeans probably because of the cool design and a photograph shoot was happening the morning i checked out 
problems
my fault i left out my fashion jewelry and laptop 
a set of brand stainless steel rings were removed from my luggage they are probably looking really good on whomever is wearing them after a long day of tours i found my laptop bottom screws were all unscrewed so that one of the covers fell off just before i checked out their problem was probably it was an older laptop and couldnt get anything for spare parts or didnt have enough time to dismantle it
be sure to placed high up since the lobby is used as a bar and events are held downstairs 
the staff seemed to be distract with visitors at the lobby they were unhelpfull and made themselves scarce 
when i confronted the clerk with my laptop situation she said the only people that have access to your room is the cleaning staff   duh who else would like a set of rings for free she was surprised unprepared to deal with the situation and clearly wanted me to just dissapear glad i did this on my way out because i would of had long faces during the rest of my stay
the cleaning staff seemed just as discontent witht their job as the clerks at the desk
their was a musty smell from the rug that went away with the ac
i would stay there again storing everything under locks ad of course taking a chance  and extensive use of the security box even on a tight schedule and would not expect service just on the location alone if you need to move around on your own it serves well 
i would be embarassed to recomend just on the belongings issue alone what if a friend got their things meddled with like i was",3.0
charming and affordable,"i stayed at the hotel fig for 5 nights for a conference at the la convention center its super convenient and only took me 10 minutes or so to walk to my conference the hotel is very charming with old spanishmoroccan decor lots of handmade tile wrought iron and heavy drapes the lady that checked us in was very nice i didnt experience any rudeness like other guests whove posted to this site 
we were lucky and got a big corner room we enjoyed our double twin bed room with tv fridge desk and sitting area with a small table and two big chairs i passed by some of the queen bed rooms when the maids were cleaning and they looked really small 8day parking is also very reasonable also for you mexican food fans check out the great holeinthewall mexican place called fernandos taco inn attached to the car wash next door it looks like a fast food joint but as a native socaler i can vouch that it is cheap tasty authentic mexican food i couldnt help myselfi ate there 4 times
its old though so if you want something more modern stay somewhere else if you want a hair dryer ask for one at the front desk also bring your own alarm clockthere isnt one provided my only major complaint is that the shower did not drain usually by the time i was finished with my 15 minute shower id be up to my ankles in water oh well still the hotel is a great buy and very convenient for conferences",4.0
avoid this hotel,"got up to turn down the ac in the middle of the night and the rug by the ac was all wet perhaps drips from the ac but unfortunately it also had a nasty urine odor
they claimed to have free wireless when i called down to say it wasnt working they said yes it hadnt been working for several days days to fix a router are you kidding me the santa cruz fire had just started and we didnt know if our cabin was on fire the restaurant had mediocre food and closed with no room service after 9 pm we just wanted some water no water at the front desk the vending machines were only taking nickels do you carry around a dollar or two in nickels no place to get change terrible service tv was very low quality and the advertised free hbo also didnt work i would never stay at this clarion again it is very disappointing because we have had good experiences at other clarions also the area around the hotel is not good  not safe",1.0
great rategreat foodgreat location,this hotel is great after just arriving or getting ready to leave la minutes from the airport and they offer free shuttle service we rent a car from budget which is literally on the opposite corner of the hotel and return it the night before our flight walk back to the hotel and then take the shuttle to the airport included in the room rate is a delicious cooked to order breakfast each morning the indoor pool is ok  a little cavelike but it does the job they also have hbo and cartoon network  heaven this hotel is clean and a good bargain they are also close to attractions such as the labrea tar pits hollywood blvd rodeo drive and sunset ranch great trail rides through the hollywood hills also if youre into snowboardingskiing check out mt baldy  about 45 minutes from this hotel my husband and son went snowboarding on our trip in april and were very impressed by the size of the mountain,5.0
great hotel will come back,"great hotel great location great rooms came with friends and will come back with friends spouse or family again 
one of the few hotels we found that had more than one bed in a room since we were traveling as friends we all wanted our own bed 5 of us had 2 rooms one with 2 twin beds and one with 1 king and 1 twin loft good layout never felt crowded lots of mirror space for ladies getting ready nights were quiet never heard neighbors hallway noise or outside noise and did i say its 12 a block from times square its a very central location even if you want to stay away from times square its such a central location its easy to get anywhere we used the subway to get around walked a lot and took a few cabs 
the deli 2 doors to the east is great for good inexpensive meals they have grocery items deli and hot and cold items we ate at least 1 meal a day there or brought it back to our room our reservations included a free breakfast at the hotel it was a great variety of cereal yogurt breads fruit coffee juice 
we didnt use the pool a pool in nyc but it looked cute

perfect for my family of 4,"we stayed here one night while on a road trip from md to fl we had to stop in charlotte to visit and decided to spend our one night here the property is gorgeous we had a one bedroom suite which provided just enough space and privacy for settling our 2 small children after an 8 hour road trip breakfast the following morning was great and well stocked free parking is literally right across the street very easy to get to we opted for the valet parking because it was raining and we were dealing with fussy kids

great location small room,"i stayed here recently for a game at camden yards the hotel is in a fantastic location for the park as it was only about a 5 minute walk however our room was on the first floor next to the street and the elevator so it was very loud the sidewalk leading from the ballpark was literally outside our window so there was heavy foot traffic for hours before and after the game 
the room itself was decent but small as we only had a single bed there was a microwave which was a plus there is a coffee shop in the lobby that sells bagels and such for morning but a bit on the expensive side
overall a decent place to stay just ask for a room not on street level",3.0

city club 20,"almost 5 years ago i gave this place two huge thumbs up i decided to return to see if my experience could be replicated it was not it was exceeded as usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do i booked late and through a third party site during a very busy time in ny while i was prepared for a broom closet with a bed i was upgraded without request upon arrival later in my stay i met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in ny i had to come back to the city the following week and mentioned this to the manager as i was checking out i had checked the 3rd party site but the city club wasnt showing any availability not only did the manager secure a room for me but also at an extremely competitive price he also gave me his card i shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and boom another upgrade this time to the two story suite all i can say is dont die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach boast two story windows and a spiral staircase that is ultra hipamazing and would be well worth the standard suite price let me give 2 more quick asides about this place 1 i was running late when i realized that i had forgotten a toiletry item a call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes  this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time 2 the front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and i should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room the city club is still in a great central location with great design and amenities but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom my wife wants to see the yankees in the playoffs for our anniversary anybody wanna guess where well be staying

i have not been put out of a worst place,the outside of the hotel the lobby and the elevators are truly misleading once you step into the corridors of the hotel the horror begins the doors are hideous theres old paint over older paint the room was very small the bed minute and the furniture rummaged the towels smelled of burnt popcorn the toilet leaked and the shower looked like something other than water was going to come out i wondered why the television was so loud when turned on then the answer was given when i turned on the acheat unit it was then a judgment call on whether i wanted to be warm by the heat or entertained by the tv if you used the cliche i have been put out of places worst that this this hotel will definitely be the subject of that claim it was the worst place i have stayed in my 33 years of breathing and blinking,1.0
a beauty found in 5 minutes,"weve been staying in a lot of hotels world over we like to travel we were looking for a decent hotel in a budget and we had 10 minutes to find one my hubby found this one in 5 
we were in vegas and the extreme weather on the east coast cost us and thousands others their flights initenerarys schedules time and money we finally decided that if we could go across to the east coast only 5 days later we were not going to spend another 4 in vegas so we decided on a last minute trip to san fran and everyone who has been there will vouch for this decision
so we had to finalize everything double quick or risk getting stuck when we reached san fran or hang around the san fran airport till and if we got something decent in our budget there were too many variables and too little time and even less money after the weather tossed all plans up
so we accessed trip advisor at mcclarrens and looked for the best rated in value for money propositions after fixing a budget of 50 bucks a day my hubby saw the opal the review and the price decided to go up by 10 bucks more a day and booked it
and it was beautiful
the service at the reception and in the rooms was courteous and thoughtful and the 3 or 4 people rotating at the front desk all looked like old and experienced hands which at times may come at the expense of courtesy 
they seemed to be quite well versed with international travellers and their needs compared to those in miami and i was pleasantly surprised when they obtained the jet and austrian airways numbers for me off a pad kept for ready reference on the side
the breakfast was a basic fare but the room and location was brilliant amenities were pretty basic but way more than what we expected considering what we were ready to pay at that time
all in all we got really lucky with this one the location price look and feel and the service were worth quite a bit more than we paid and we had just come in from circus circus in vegas so it felt even better",5.0
soso hotel in a great location,"stayed here for 3 nights while visiting seaworld great location and easy access to the freeway we stayed ina kids suite and the boys loved their bunk beds and separate room the other room for adults was cramped with furniture the wardrobe takes a lot of space and doesnt hold much but there was no closet and tended to be dark the kids room has the window breakfast was crowded but fine except for our last day at the waffle line three waffle makers two women were making waffles for their entire families at least 4 or 5 apiece and i stood in line for at least 20 minutes maybe the hotel could suggest folks make 2 waffles during peak periods anyway aside from those inconsiderate ladies folks were generally nice front desk staff was supremely unhelpful though i asked where the closest gas station was and the staff couldnt tell me compared to another hotel we stayed at in carlsbad during this trip it was clear that these staff members didnt give a hoot about helping us out or making sure we had a good experience next time i think well stay in carlsbad and just drive a little farther
we stayed during comiccon so hotel was crowded
also found it frustrating that hotel charged by the minute to use their business center computers or printers we needed to print out boarding passes for our flight home we already paid for the room and for parking adding this cost on just seemed punitive also had wifi trouble like another guest mentioned but i called the 800 number for help and was able to resolve",3.0

ignore all the other reviews,i just spent two nights in this hotel and was terrified before arriving and desperately tried but failedto book other accomodations after reading reviews on this site needless to say i asked to see the suite we booked before presenting our credit card the friendly desk clerk obliged with no problem the rooms were small as advertised but clean the bathroom was miniscule but adequate and spotlessly clean the beds were extremely comfortable and the pillows were of high quality there was no sign of any bugs either cockroaches or bedbugs our rooms were freshly painted and there was no sight of peeling paint anywhere i slept like a baby with the window open the second night i asked the desk for another blanket and it was on my bed upon my return the neighborhood is quiet and safe the subway is two short blocks away and cabs were easily caught on west end avenue a block away if your plan is to find inexpensive accomodations and are travelling with a friend or with children the suite at 109night is unbeatable the two rooms connected by the bath gave us privacy we could have never had in a standard double room i will stay here again,5.0
possibly the worst hotel ive ever stayed in,"was put up here by american airlines after my flight was cancelled there is not enough space to describe how bad this place is i will sum it up by saying it smells is dirty the food is awful the sheets are so bad that they light up the room at night with static electricity  there are no curtains that close and this is after i asked to change rooms to a better one
i would never stay in this place again next time if there is no choice of hotel left i will sleep on the floor at ohare",1.0
pleasantly surprised by the good service and clean room,for our 40th wedding aniversary we decided to spend the weekend in dc with our bicycles i had called earlier to clarify the parking situation and was informed of the 28 fee per 24 hours but also the possibility of parking on the street for free i asked the likelyhood of finding a spaceand was told it was good if we arrived early saturday morning the doorman larry came out and assisted us with pulling into the garage entrance and removing the bicycles from the roof he not only helped get our cycles into the hotel but secured us a parking spot in the front of the hotel since a room was not ready they also allowed us to change our clothes in the restrooms the room was very clean and comfortable,4.0
welcome to 1995,"first off let me say the staff here is topnotch courteous attentive professional everything youd want virtually every staff member i encountered from front desk to housekeeping to food service went the extra step management should be extremely proud of this team
its a good thing the staff is great because they have to compensate for a property in dire need of updating theres a reason none of the hotel photos show a television its because they are all big clunky circa1995 bowfront crt tvs no flat panels in the hotel at all yes i asked no hd i know how old they are because i bought one of these monstrosities back in 95 of course back then it was cutting edge
in addition the highspeed internet is delivered via ethernet cable no wireless in the rooms and its sloooooooow and it disconnects frequently and you have to pay for it in 1995 when the internet was all brandnew and shiny we were thrilled and impressed just be able to connect while traveling however this is 2010 soon 2011 and wired slow and spotty just doesnt impress anymore this was the dealbreaker for this hotel for me i had a lot of work to get done and it was virtually impossible highly frustrating unacceptable
there is no inroom fridge although you can have one brought up and no microwave hotel parking is a few private floors in the public airport garage while there are security cameras and bright lighting and a few wandering employees it still felt a bit creepy walking through the garage alone at night parking is 17 per night other hotels in the area are 7 while still others are free id have probably paid extra for the security of valet parking but it is not offered
ok lets go over the neutrals location  it is connected to the airport if youre going out on terminal b youre all set you can walk any other terminal however and you may as well be 3 miles away terminal f is an especially long walk i know because on my first night i mistakenly followed the few signs that said hotel this way  and it took me a good 40 minutes including having to follow a very nice airport employee im not being sarcastic who took me the fastest route which included 5 or so minutes traipsing through the parking garage
the bathroom in my room was good somewhat larger than your typical hotel bathroom but not luxurysize definitely workable for one person at a time although i think youd be hardpressed for two to try to get primped simultaneously
the lobby is quite nice very businessappropriate no complaints here whatsoever i did not see or use the business center pool or fitness center so i cant comment on them
now with that out of the way lets go back to the positives the bed was fantastic oh so comfy everything was very clean no bedbugs or evidence of any yes i checked room service was quick and efficient and the food was tasty
this is a no pets hotel that is definitely a positive for me i dont live with animals of my own and i definitely dont want to be around someone elses dog slobber ick i believe it is also a nosmoking hotel again a positive 
overall i would love to rate this hotel higher simply based on the staff unfortunately this marriott is i believe the most expensive hotel near the airport simply being attached to the airport is not in my opinion enough to justify the price or to overlook the glaring shortcomings marriott could and should do better until it does i cannot in good conscience recommend this property",3.0
great location,"the hotel itself is clean and very busy it is very busy and always hustling when they say conference center they sure mean it it isnt a hotel with any personal touches 
the rooms were very comfortable and clean for a person who is a germaphobe i was comfortable there that says a lot the beds were really comfy the hotel wasfull as they said at the front desk so housekeeping seemed to be backed up our room wasnt cleaned until midlate afternoon i didnt love returning in the afternoon to shower and find the towels from the morning still on the flooroh well

rooms are very small but quite stylish and clean good quality bath and bed linen stairwells and corridors very dingy and dark in need of a lick of paint
location is just fantastic 5 mins walk to times square across street for subway station bar at end of street house of brews very good lovely food and great atmosphere we went to two ice hockey games during our stay rangers at msg and islanders at nassau coliseum on long island both had fantastic atmosphere and great crowd our longest road trip to date",4.0
wonderful remodel  bathroom configuration is odd,hotel is only five minutes from lax but one can not hear the airport noise day or night valet parking is 20night with inout privilages while selfpark is 17  might as well pay the extra 3 for the convenience the hotel has shuttle service to lax and the marriott every 15 minutes which is very convenient this hotel has had a complete renovation unlike some courtyards which have only remodeled the lobby the lobby is the bistro concept which courtyard is rolling out and is standard fare we walked to the marriott which has three restaurants on site and took the free shuttle back after dinner  very convenient and better options if looking for a proper sitdown dinner the floors looks beautiful and the newly remoded rooms are spacious  however and this is the only reason i did not rate this hotel as excellent the bathroom sink is not enclosed and is right next to the closest in the main living part of the room it is very strange configuration is unsanitary for one person but is just gross for two people or more in a room  there is a total lack of privacy with this concept and i really dont understand what was on the minds of the designers with this i understand that this hotel caters to onenight only business travel which usually indicates one person in the room i would not feel comfortable at all traveling with my husband with this concept  i need a bit more privacy than this room afforded as long as people are aware of this issue upfront and are ok with it this is a great hotel for an overnight near lax for a couple or family not so much,4.0
highs and lows,"the bed was wonderful as it is in other westin hotels location is great as it is linked to the copley place mall and is located in the heart of back bay 
for some reason though housekeeping did not do a great job of cleaning our room and when we came back from a days meeting the room did not look cleaned at all though the sheets and towels were changed
unfortunately there was a fire a few blocks from the hotel on our last night there and we were not allowed to go back to the hotel in the evening for fear of toxic fumes and although the staff worked their best to keep guests comfortable the hotel was not ready for such emergencies so there were no lights in the rooms the hotel ran out of flashlights as well only one elevator was working and we had to contend with cold showers in the winter
hopefully the emergency situation has taught the westin a lesson in running a hotel during and emergency",3.0

not good for 3 ina room,the hotel itself was very clean and friendly staff helped to make our stay enjoyable i had booked a room for 3 people not near the evlevator we arrived to find our room next to the elevator and only 2 beds this was rectified by allocating another room for us but it was not big enough to have the cot bed out until the other 2 people had finished in the bathroom each night this was very inconvenient the restaurant did not cater for vegetarians during our stay there either,3.0
convenience is not enough,"after a long day of flying we were greeted at the front desk with annoyance that we had interrupted the conversation as the adage says you only get one chance to make a first impression
as we were reluctantly checked in another customer came up and asked about the rate for the evening when he was told a rack rate 25 cheaper than our reservation rate i asked if i could have that rate instead again with reluctance the clerk agreed geez
if you are a hhonors diamond you get the cold items only on the breakfast buffet and a completely uninspired and loud room guess they get so many folks as a captive audience they dont actually have to try to please you
the only reason i would stay here again is if i were stranded and there were no options off airport 
convenient sure but then again so are the dozens of hotels surrounding the airport that have shuttle busses  even though i am a hhonors diamond
never again",1.0
didnt live up to park hyatt brand or expectations,"leaving aside the odd layout of the rooms my husband bumped into walls several times and the hotel itself try the walk to the health club the most confusing aspect was the service while staff were friendly quite frankly their communication skills were poor had two bad check in experiences that set the tone for the visit check in check out getting a cab all the basics of a hotel stay with exception of room service staff who were lovely and delivered on time were awkward and unpolished
there must be better luxury hotels in washington in fact there appear to be two within two blocks",3.0
lovely room but not 5 star service all around,"we booked this stay last minute and thus paid a pretty penny for our executive 1 bedroom with a fireplace i booked the fireplace package as that seems like a nice option my spouse checked in before me and when i called to ask him about the room he said it is nice but had no fireplace i then called the front desk on my way there and a very helpful front desk staff moved our room right away to one of the suites with a fireplace this made me happy although i had wished they had not made the initial mistake 
when i arrived at the hotel and pulled up in front no one came over to help me with my bags or to move my car so i pulled out my own bags and moved toward the door and finally the bell hop came and gave me a claim ticket but did not ask to help me with my things i do have to say i expect a bit more service at this caliber hotel 
when i arrived we had a fire in the fireplace and i found the room very clean the carpet comment from a previous reviewer is on target as they did seem a bit worn the furniture was nice and the bed very comfortable i do wish there was a fan in the bathroom as the mirror quite fogged up after my shower yes as another reviewer noted the drain could not handle the lovely shower head as it did back up a bit we were only there one night so i cannot speak to housekeeping but they did have nice robes towels and toiletries
the next morning on my way to the cafe for breakfast i dropped my valet tag with someone from the front desk i told him i was grabbing a bite to eat and would be done in less than 30 mins he told me my car would be out front waiting for me this was busy but not overly hectic friday morning so when i got outside and found out that there was no car and no knowledge of getting my request 30 mins earlier i was not impressed with the staffs ability to followthrough i ended having to wait another 10 mins to get my car and when the valet showed up with it he was very apologetic but also did not offer to help with my bags he only did so after i asked if he could grab them off the luggage carrier 
overall i think lovely accommodations with sometimes spotty service staff",4.0
elegant urban refuge with friendly staff,located in the heart of downtown seattle right across the street from the stunning seattle public library designed by rem koolhaas the hotel monaco is a friendly and extremely attractive urban refuge for the busy visitor i found the reception staff friendly and highly responsive and my room was a joy  modern welldesigned immaculate and countryquiet some hotels i tolerate others i delight in this one definitely falls in the latter category i highly recommend it,5.0
great location average rooms,i stayed in this hotel to attend a conference the venue was great right on the riverwalk and just a block over from a shopping mall in fact i rented a car thinking id leave to explore the city a bit but there was so much within walking distance it never left the garage the hotel itself is pretty standard  nothing spectacular i did like the 24hour coffee bar and newsstand the inhouse restaurant was dreadful  food service everything they had a gym facility however that was really good  each machine had its own tv there were fresh towels and sanitized headphones and a full weight room there was also an outdoor lap pool which looked nice but i did not use it the rooms were decidedly average and i got a lot of noise from the neighbors but they were otherwise comfortable i have a cd of rain sounds that i use as white noise so the music coming from elsewhere wasnt too bothersome aside from the hotel restaurant the place was pretty good,4.0
great hotel,"we have stayed in this hotel for three nights in the beginning of june the hotel is huge and amazing the lobby is very grand and spacious staff is very friendly the rooms are nice and clean and about average size and apparently well insolated there was a large wedding party sleeping across the hall and we didnt hear a thing  we were exhausted after the flight but still 
i have only eaten in the marquee bar so i can only comment on that but it was great very tasty and reasonably priced for breakfast i recommend open city across the street you can sit outside or in and they have a great breakfast selection catering to both american and european tastes and you can choose healthier options like fruit or tomatoes instead of hashbrowns i have not tried the breakfast in the hotel
absolute highlight of the hotel is the pool its gorgeous you feel like youre in a resort because it is a rather expensive hotel we had een good deal of about 500 dollars for three nights through expedia but the normal rate is more than double the pool is not crowded with people who hog all the chairs and if you put up a little flag next to your chair the waiter will come and help you how cool is that
as for the location in the surrounding area there is the zoo a supermarket the woodley park metro stop and several places to eat including aforementioned open city and mcdonalds the national mall is about 10 min metro ride away so perfectly acceptable 
the next stop 2 min away is dupont circle which has a lot of nice places to eat

cant wait to go back,this is a unique hotel experience as it is so spread out on its own island i loved every minute of it the spa is fabulous ask for desiree for a therapeutic massage that will change your life i was there for business the hotel convention staff led by rebecca were top notch along with swank audios team led by jackie everyone was excellent at what they did as well as so very nice and helpful i want to return with my family as i could see all of the fun family activities to do i asked the front desk at check in for a remote spot and wow did they accommodate i felt like i had my own island apartment cant wait to go back ,5.0
nice stay clean hotel,i like homewood suites in general and this was one of the nicer properties i have stayed in the hotel and rooms were very clean quiet and spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable this hotel was great for a night and would be very nice for a prolonged stay,4.0
joi de vivre should be ashamed of themselves,"this place looked a little funky from the photos online but we assumed that because it was part of the joi de vivre chain that we were safe boy were we wrong i have no problem with kitch or bright colors etc but expect at least cleanliness in any hotel 
we checked in with our young baby only to find that the crib we requested was brokenit got worse when the replacement crib arrived covered in stains and we found long black hairs all over the dilapidated bathroom the couch was also stained and the queen size bed as advertised was a saggy fullsized that my husband and i could not fit in to after an 8hour car ride to get there and check in we quickly scrambled to find another hotel for our weekend stay very disappointed
the one upside they were very nice when we said we wanted to check out and did not charge us anything for our trouble",1.0
beautiful but watch out for hidden costs,clean and pleasant with friendly staff the low cost headline price was attractive but expensive breakfasts and parking bumped up the cost a lot,4.0
another great w hotel but so expensive,this a great w hotel in a fabulous location on park avenue but at over 700 a night with internet 20 a day on top its difficult to be upbeat nice rooms modern as is the w way and very helpful trendy staff i was staying on a business trip so the bill wasnt painful personally but i cant say that it is worth that price shame really otherwise it has everything going for it,3.0
one of the better hotels i have stayed in,"i stayed in the hotel for 3 days and unfortunately landed there on the weekend of the memorial holiday which meant that we were unable to sample the restuarant as it was closed 
we had no problems with the staff
our room was lovely but our bathroom was very much on the small size there was no way you were getting two people in there at the same time and we are not big people
apart from that i would recommend this hotel in the future",4.0
good older hotel with decent restaurant,"spent 2 nights recently comfortable rooms are somewhat tired but good value for rate i paid 2 really good features starbucks coffee wellmade in the coffee bar in lobby and quite good food for dinner in dining room  i had grilled fish that was tasty and not overcooked
i found the front desk staff to not be properly energized in responding to guests however all other staff were gracious and responsive shuttle to airport runs every 20 mins",3.0
friendly an welcoming service,"a week in the sheraton was pleasure they could not do enough for me from providing a courtesy coach calling cabs and giving travel directions they were really helpful the guys at reception were always friendly and welcoming as were the bar staff the food choice in the bar was limited but was very good
rooms were excellent and having use of the executive lounge is well worth the extra
ill definitely be back here next time im in houston",5.0
despite a few problems very good place,"just finished a twonight award stay at the intercontinental times square judging by the clientele id say its more touristoriented than businessoriented but as someone who fell into the latter category it was ok
on balance in fact i liked it a lot rooms are fine and quietnot huge but decent size excellent and friendly staff including reservations front desk concierge etc goodsized flat screen tv as someone who likes and needs caffeine to get going first thing in the morning the quality of the machine netspresso and coffee is a level above many other hotels 
ive noticed a few complaints about street noise on lower floors upgraded to an upper floor room i had not problem with this at all
there were a few glitches to report however
1 the wireless internet for my laptop didnt connect both days which in turn meant the hotel passed my on to an offsite service provider which has a rather complicated process for making the connection in other words 15 minutes both days for something most other hotels provide without a problem
2 even once connected with supposedly higher speed premium service the connection was kind of slow
3 one morning i did not get the wakeup call i requested i always set an alarm as a backup but this could have been a real problem otherwise
4 that aforementioned coffee machine is not strictly intuitive for someone who had trouble functioning until he gets his coffeethe water compartment didnt open automatically i suspect most folks could sort it out more easily than i did though
5 the tv was a bit glitchy one of the times i used it
having said all this the good outweighed the bad so id give the hotel another shot if the same problems cropped up though that shot would be my last one",4.0
hair in the tub and sand on the bed,from the directions they had given us i could not find it for a while  it was off of the main road hidden in a dark spot right behind two strip clubs while we were walking up the stairs to our room there was a homeless man digging in the garbage can and a couple other people sleeping next to it the people in the office had no idea what they were taking about and actually couldnt even speak english well enough for me to understand them i forgot my phone charger in the room and got all the way back to phoenix az and called them and there words were  ummmm uh can you describe the charger um uh well the maids might know where it is can you maybe call tomorrow its just not a very safe place and actually kind of scary at night i would not reccomend this to anyone unless you like sand in your bed when you lay in t and little curly hairs in the bath tub thanks  ashley,1.0
nice hotel but not for travellers,we selected this hotel for its history and were very impressed with the pictures and agree with the other review about the pictures etc the room was clean service was good but our view was of the air conditioning systems for the hotel which was very disappointing that view became a common theme throughout our stay in the us i would not recommend this place for travellerstourists who do not have a car public transport is not as easy or available as you think we waited over 15 hours for a bus to warners studio that he hotel guide advised would be along every 20 minutes the train was close however did not feel that safe using it,3.0
location and price,we came in for the weekend and return to the belvedere this was my second stay at the hotel price and location are the two main reasons for returning both cant be beaten our room was on the 16th floor the remodeling was still continuing below the 16th floor because of this the room still needed to be updated the room had a 1980ish feel to it nevertheless the room was big enough by nyc standards and clean the front desk clerk was outstanding we came to the hotel to drop off ours bags at 10am and we were able to check in earlyvery nice i would definitely return if you thinking about staying here i would recommend it just keep in mind hotels in new york city are notoriously small and if you are looking for a big room pay and stay in a suite,4.0
for real,found this place on choicehotelscom and was pleasantly surprised at what i saw imagine our surprise when we got there and it was just as nice the lobby was very warm though maybe the ac wasnt working no bother we checked in and was helped by the front desk in a very friendly manner i think the girls name was kelly the building was an old warehouse that was transformed into the hotel clean clean clean there was a welcome letter from the manager on the table in our room with a complimentary water bottle and 2 small bags of chips the ac in the room worked great breakfast wasnt just continental it was hot and abundant unfortunately the 2 days that we went the same hot food was served sausage and eggs would have liked to have seen potatoes or bacon the area was small but very clean and there was someone who was constantly filling up the food there are some chairs and tables outside of the building along with a bbq grill the best part of the hotel would be the location of the circulator bus right outside and free did not like the fact that parking was not included at 15night we left our car there when we arrived because there werent as many parking spots to accomodate the amount of rooms not to mention no security in the lot either would defintely stay here again if in the area,4.0
great location,"hotels in manhattan are extremely expensive when you accept this  hotel 31 is among the best deals
the location is the best part of a stay at hotel 31 you can walk to a lot of the must see attractions and some of the best shopping the subway is nearby which connects you to the rest of the city in a fast and cheap way
the neighbourhood is not among the must see attractions but it provides several good restarants at fair prices and some pretty cool bars as well we recommend the les halles at park av between 28th and 29th
our room was rather small and dark however it was clean and everything was working the bed was comfortable
breakfast is not included or available at the hotel however guy and gallard around the corner is nice and gives a large selection at fair prices 
the staff was friendly eg arranged transportation to the airport and helped out with our online check in 24 hours before departure
all in all the hotel 31 was a good experience and contribution to a great vacation in nyc",4.0
continuing education and more,went on wednesday and stayed til sunday noon and had the time of our lives i had no idea of how great the city of indy was and is until this visit though my daughter had told me it was a rocking site summer in indy is great fun tho warm our room was a corner room on the 9th floor overlooking the city and veterans ball fieldas my wife got smarter i visited the city and enjoyed especially the indianapolis art museum the eiteljorg and the childrens museumswhen it was hot during the day at night we ate out at superb sites and went to the indians feeder for cleveland game goodclean fun at every turn,5.0
loud but great,"this is my second time here at the w the staff are very friendly the service is excellent and the room is very comfortable and stylish as i have come to love about the w chain my only issue is that its not the quietest place to stay it feels like single pane glass versus double pane sirens are easy to hear as are whistles etc outside 
having said that the room really is great",4.0
great hotel quiet location away from the chaos,"if you want a nice hotel with great amenities in a quiet location of nyc stay here you get a refrigerator free wifi continental breakfast and warm cookies near the south street seaport  very quiet location  dont hear the subway or honking of horns 
its about a 15 minute walk to the nearest subway stops  but multiple stations on various lines so easy to walk to about 12 mile from chinatown and great restaurants great view of the brooklyn bridge
one of the favorite hotels in nyc  away from the chaos that you find in most areas in nyc
if this is your first trip to nyc it maybe too far from a subway stop  but i highly recommend this hotel and location friendly staff too",5.0
great place and sooo convenient,i canot believe how easy the westin makes it to travel  we arrived at the front and was immediately greeted by somewhere to valet the car in the morning all we had to do was take the elevator downstairs and walk directly to the ticket area for delta upon arriving back we gave the valet our claim ticket and within 10minutes out car was waiting for us at the curb amazing,5.0
why stay here,picture a grandiose apartment complex on a large golf course in the middle of a suburb sourrounded by many other apartment complexes that is this resort why does anyone stay here perhaps it is the golf course and the spa which i did not try it cannot be the rooms  mine had cheap western decor and halfchewed cherios and chips on the floor it is not the service which was mostly indifferent for instance when i checked out 4 hours after breakfast and asked to have breakfast on the bill the front desk clerk said rudely well youll just have to wait until you get your credit card bill it certainly is not the grounds which have mroe in common with suburban san antonio than the texas hill country you would do better choosing a hotel with character in san antonio or going to the real hill country far outside the city this place is just depressing,2.0
well worth it,we stayed at this hotel because it was close to a conference we were attending and it had received high marks on tripadvisor my only complaint was that it was tricky to pick the right exit from the expressway other than that the staff was very friendly the room was clean and quiet and we enjoyed the pool and fitness center breakfast was perfectly adequate with sufficient choices from waffles to fruit well stay here again when were in the area,5.0
excellent hotel great staff valet was reasonable and helpful,stayed here july 22 and 23 with my wife and children it was nice and the room was nice and clean with a balcony overlooking riverwalk mini fridge and coffee maker tv was flatscreen and love seat had fold out bed as well nice bistrobar in hotel and direct riverwalk access we checked out and they allowed us to leave our cars and luggage there in lockup for an additional 3 hours while we took our kids on the riverwalk barge tour and ate very nice staff and helpful with all our needs,5.0
enjoyed my stay at the doubletree,i recently stayed 4 nights at the doubletree guest suites and it was just wonderful the staff were all very helpful the suite was very nice and the bed oh so comfortable of course the hot chocolate chip cookie at checkin was thouroughly enjoyed i also appreciated the close proximaty to the southcenter mall and all the great restaurants there thanks for the great stay,5.0
amazing deal in nyc walk back into the days of titanic,"i found that if you find a cheaper rate anywhere on the internet this hotel will match it and give you another 10 off the room per night the hotel is very elegant and classical inside the rooms are a little small but the overall room is very nice and more importantly th bed is very comfortablenot too hard the hotel had alot of history and fun to read about ive stayed in some of the most expensive hotels in the city but for the price and location i cant complain i found some people were paying 39900 a night for the samew room we where paying 16400 i am returning next week and paying 14500 a night for 5 nights you may not always be able to get this good a deal but i promise if you surf the internet enough for the best price you will come out ahead compared to what other hotels are charging and not half as nice i have only one complaint about the hotel
service we had to wait in a line for check in but this was a problem each day we walked by at 3pmi suggest showing up a little later for check in if you can and when our cab pulled up the bellman didnt offer to help with our bags i was glad we didnt have too much it saved us the tip if you want to spend over 50000 a night in the city the best place for me is the ny palace hands down but if you want a nice place but not the price tag then i strongly urge you to try the roosevelt the location is close to everything and beautifully decorated i felt like i had walked back in time ive stayed at the palace many times and love it but its just got too expensive in our economic crunch right now
i am happy to return to the roosevelt again and again as long as i can keep the rate where it is im not too concerned with service when i have my husband with me to carry the bagslol im sure i will be able to get a bellman when i return alone next week",4.0
comfortable charming hideaway,i liked the old world style charm of the hotel with friendly helpful staff it is well located only a few blocks from many attractions such as empire state and easy walk to times square i was originally a bit dubious when we were offered accommodation at the hotel at quite a reasonable rate as part of a qantas package but i was glad to be proved wrong the hotel and room were generally quiet with my only minor complaint being the air conditioner seemed a bit noisy at times but i was glad to have it i have already recommended it to people at work who are looking at going to new york,5.0
not sure what to think,when we arrived we loved the hotel we loved all the space in our room the people where nice and the free shuttle took us to the red wings game great location the next morning we went to the continental breakfast there was cereal but no milk there was picked over muffins there was very very black bananas that i would throw out at home there were mostly empty juice containers there were danishes wrapped in plastic like you would get at a truck stop the coffee was good i went to the desk and they said they would let someone know a very nice bellman came and refilled everything but said that he hadnt been asked to my biggest concern here is that the next day someone tried to spend a lot of money on my credit card in canada of course i do not know what happened we had not been to canada but it is probably about a mile from the hotel it was the only hotel we stayed at and i would probably have to think twice before going back,3.0
very good location for this eclectic hotel,stayed in sept 2011 after checking reviews of many hotels in san francisco before booking the mosser the hotel lived up to all the hype its exterior design being typical of san fran architecture and the reception and communal areas reflecting its art deco styling the welcome at checkin was warm and welcoming and the room was as per the trip advisor and hotels own description a lack of air conditioning in the room meant that it was very hot especially at nighttime so if i were to return id definitely upgrade to a room with aircon overall very good value and being just off market street the location was spoton would definitely recommend this hotel for a comfortable and relaxing time in san fran,4.0
know what your expectations are prior to booking,"we had a wonderful vacation and this was exactly the place we needed knowing what to expect after reading all the mixed reviews if you want a 5 star hotel this is not the place for you it is older and this is evident by the furniture and the carpet in the rooms but our room was very clean and the grounds were spectacular the room reminded me of beach front condos we have rented and have also enjoyed we stayed in a bayside studio and it was clean and comfortable it was very quiet i think that is also dependent on your neighbors no matter where you stay we loved being able to step out of our room with our daughter to go play in the sand and watch the beautiful sunsets it also had the convenience of a small kitchen that had a small fridge a microwave and a full sized coffee pot we bought our own drinks and snacks the employees were all very cordial and accommodating the restaurants had great food the barefoot grill had a wonderful atmosphere with a great view on the bay kids enjoyed feeding the fish and the frequent visits from the seagulls we knew it would be pricey to eat on the grounds the hotel is overpriced overall the 22 parking fee was no surprise thanks to the other reviewers and when we were checking out other hotels in san diego most of them had a 20 parking fee we were taken by the hotel tax 
in summary this a great place to get away from it all and be with your family i suggest staying in a studio or bungalow if feasible to get a better room judging from the other reviews staying on the water is expensive no matter where you stay in san diego and there is certainly no real value here being on the water was a priority for us and this place met our expectations",4.0
simply the best,i only stay at the french quarters when i come to new york city on business which is several times a year the rate is incredibly reasonable especially considering you are literally a block and a half from being in times square the staff are friendly an helpful housekeeping keeps things very well madeup every day while you are out and the location could not be better you can literally see about 20 restaurants from the front door great food within walking distance and times square one avenue away manager colin is fantastic as are all the staff members i would not stay anywhere else,5.0
was ok for me but i would not bring my family,"i needed a relatively inexpensive place to stay for a night and at about 40 of what other national chain boston hotels were charging i gave it a try and i probably would stay there again  by myself or if i could get tickets to a red sox game for my family i dont think there could be a more convenient hotel for fenway
but i actually did move a chair in front of the door because there was no secondary security like the flippy bar thing on the door and on a sunday night when the red sox were not playing the hotel seems a little sketchy i am not saying it is but arriving late at night when no one is around seemed it
i think the room was clean there was an old area rug on the floor that again seemed like it may have been chosen because it could hide stains and the furniture  other than the beds which were comfy with good pillows  was not only old but really worn  with lighter areas where the stain had born worn off over the years there were wooden venetian blinds on the windows that could no longer be operated by just moving one center slat  all of the individual slats had to be moved to shut them and they felt like a tictactoe at a beat up kids playground where you try to get it to stay on x but it keeps moving so i dont think i ever really got them closed
and id probably be accurate if i said the bathroom was a little weirdcreepy it was spotless as the paper strip on the toilet said was sanitized for me but it was uncomfortably large and empty  imagine sitting on a toilet in a warehouse
but like i said for the price i probably would stay there again  id probably just walk around in the dark in case i didnt get the blinds properly shut",3.0
great location  service bad dwelling,"i only stayed for one night while visiting the zoo with my wifes family and it was right down the road from the zoo the park was literally right across the street so that was great too and it was far enough away from the beach and downtown to avoid horrible parking and most undesirable people there were a couple of shoeless hippies wandering around with walking sticks outside the inn in the morning the staff was friendly and brought us an iron and ironing board with a tasty pastry and fruit breakfast in the morning they let us check in a little early as well which was very nice of them
i had the same problem as a previous reviewer the heat was on full blast when we first arrived that wasnt too difficult to take care of though
the buildings seem like very old apartments all the floors creak and i can imagine that anyone staying below us would have heard every step we took on those old floors the paint was peeling the carpet seemed very old it wasnt a bad place just old and probably shouldnt be ranked 3
if you need to be close to the zoo and are only planning on doing the zoo and the museum then this is a fair place if you want to see any of the rest of san diego or socal get something a little nicer",2.0
the only place i stay in san diego,"i stayed here three times during the month of june family stuff and my husband has been coming here for years what is not to like great service comfortable and affordable rooms hasslefree free internet waffles for breakfast nice pool great location to base yourself for pretty much anything in san diego across the street from the trolley station 
small older style charming rooms near the pool or larger suites in the bigger building we will always stay here in future san diego visits",5.0
absolutely fabulous,just returned from a 4 night stay at the staybridge suites times square with a friend from the moment we entered the hotel we felt comfortable the guy on reception was so happy and upbeat we immediately felt welcome we arrived thursday and attended the free evening buffet with drinks you dont usually get that in ny which was great as we had just arrived after that we went to the nearby duanne reade for some milk and nibbles our room was amazing two double beds kitchen area with full size fridgefreezer and everything you could possibly need the bathroom was plenty big enough with a shower in the corner and the water was always hot we always had clean towels and our cups and coffee maker were always cleaned while we were out breakfast was fine and we always found a table to eat it didnt need to take it to the room although some people chose to do so we found it an opportunity to chat to other guests i had noticed before leaving the uk there were comments about the street the hotel was in as two females on our own we felt very safe and never once felt threatened or uncomfortable the shop selling sexy lingerie and sex toys made us laugh not that we went in just what we saw from the door as we passed and in the window the parole office was just another place no shady characters around that i saw but then i wasnt looking to find anything wrong with the area we didnt find it noisy at all and were on the 12th floor overlooking the port authority bus station i would definitely stay here again when visiting new york city as it is centrally placed and one of the most welcoming hotels i have ever stayed in and i have stayed in many hotels around the world an absolutely fabulous hotel,5.0
great place for the money,been here a few times and for the price you cant beat this place of course its in the city do you do have the l and traffic but you also have free parking the rooms are a nice size with large bathrooms both the cafe and bar are overpriced with lousy service it meets my needs for have an inexpensive place to sleep in chicago,4.0
outstanding service  amenities,amazing room huge kitchen living room  balcony with a view of the hollywood sign and the walk of fame below record player in the room with a great selection of lps super friendly and very helpful staff couldnt have asked for more fantastic value for money coming back in feb,5.0
great service,"have to say we had a great stay thanks to the great service we got from the staff and a special thanks for george hotel suite was spacious and provided all the amenities microwave fridge cutlery which worked out great with the staff recommended late night pizza 
the hotel has a roof top lounge which is a nice place to relax and have a drink
location was quite central to the places we were going and we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go
the only negatives were the decor which could use an update also the washroom door which did not have a lock saying that it seems the washroom was built to be barrier free and likely was a feature if you have mobility issues this suite would have worked well for you
overall yeah for the beacon",4.0
great hotel great staff,great hotel good location staff was very friendly rooms clean and big we could get just about anywhere easily from this site pool was terrific for the kids room was comfortable although i thought it had a kitchenette in it  only the very expensive bar i would have preferred a small refrigerator with children i would stay there again,4.0
great staff great service great location great price,"i was very hesitant to stay at the aloft in dallas because of a lot of negative reviews i took the gamble due to the price and proximity to the convention center
the room was perfect nothing too fancy just a very comfortable room the ac worked perfect the bathroom yes even the water pressure and temperature was great and i wanted to take the bed home with me
had free wifi and wired internet a nice desk and nice big hdtv
i had an urgent need to print and fax some documents and the front desk staff was only too happy to help
only criticisms would be the location of the couch under the tv and the proximity to any eating establishments all restaurants were between 48 blocks away
the fitness room was good and the bar had very good food at a pretty reasonable price
although i am not much of a fan of dallas as a location for a conference this place made my stay much more enjoyable",4.0
totally relaxingalmost,even though our destination was sea world we stayed at this inn as an alternative to the noisy san diego hotels rbi reminded me of palm springs the grounds were beautiful and so peaceful we had a room in the fountain building there were at least 12 dozen fountains or so in this area with running water that was very soothing the pools were very nice restaurant was pretty good i believe it was called the verandah but not sure my daughter liked the childrens menu i had the buffet one night which was pretty good but could have been a lot better for the price the paella was probably the worst ive ever eaten with sticky sticky rice and the puff pastery that the swordfish was cooked in was chewy i had to pick it off just to get to the fish my husband had one of the few chicken dishes which he thought was fair breakfast buffet was good which was included in our room rate otherwise it would have been 5000 for the three of us my only real complaint about this hotel is that the beds were as hard as a rock i had the hardest time falling asleep the first night and that was after a few glasses of wine i would hardly call the room that i stayed in a 4 star the decor was a little boring though the bathroom was nice to me it seemed the room needed updatingespecially those beds i would stay at this hotel again only if they got it softer beds and im usually not that picky bad bad bad beds,4.0
amazing honeymoon hotel,"stayed here for 5 nights for our honeymoon in december we couldnt have wished for a better location or better service we received complimentary champagne and the hotel also informed some of the restaurants that we visited where we also then received complimentary drinks one evening whilst we were out at a show the room was decorated with rose petals and we arrived back to soft music playing nothing was too much trouble and there was not a single area we could fault
both my husband and myself had the best nights sleep we have ever had as the bed was super comfortable with a feather pillow top mattressheaven
we would definitely stay again and was well worth the money for a special occassion",5.0
get a room with a treadmill,"i stayed here in june 2012 for 3 nights due to a conference i was attending the hotel was impressive by its shear size with a stately lobby gorgeous grounds hammocks included and a distinguished history inaugural balls have been held there in addition to those features there were 3 highlights for me
1 i had a room with a treadmill  definitely a first i had read about their availability ahead of time so i requested such a room very cool i had a beautiful large corner room on the first floor in the west wing and it was extremely quiet and peaceful i imagine the treadmill rooms are on the first floor and at the end of hallways so as not to disturb ones neighbors i used the treadmill twice as well as the get fit pack that was provided to me gratis included a yoga mat weights fitness band
2 the fitness center rents bikes for 7hour which is very convenient due to the nearby rockcreek park trail which continues on to the national mall area i rode down the 2 12mile trail then onto the lincoln memorial area during an evening ride it was a glorious ride and a fun cheap way to see the city and get some exercise too the bike rental includes a helmet as well as a bike pouch for personal items as well as a small bike pump and tire repair kit
3 i was able to walk to the national zoo about 5 long blocks away seeing the pandas and gorillas are a must the metro is also just a block or so away which is very convenient
even though the two small elevators in my wing were slow i just used the stairs which didnt bother me since i was on the first floor i had very easy access to the conference rooms which were also in the west wing below my floor the conference rooms by the way are gorgeous  beautiful moldingdecor and some had incredible frescoes 
the staff was very accommodating and friendly my free morning beverages arrived on time join omnis free select program for those as did anything else i requested
though it was pricey i would definitely stay here again the weekend rates are cheaper so if i were paying on my own dime i would make it a long weekend stay",5.0
showing its age,although room was large and clean this is a tired hotel in need of some attention and is a good 15 to 20 minute walk away from the city centre,3.0
great stay,it has been definitely one the best hotels i have stayed in with what most be the most comfortable bed we have slept in the hotel is located in a very convenient area right at the centre but unlike others not near the dodgy central areas the staff were very friendly and helpful at all times the bed was absolutely lovely comfortable like no other and the bathroom also very nice and functional we could rest which is not something we can normally get while traveling ironically so we normally have to put up with all sorts of noise in many of the hotels we stay in or with horrible pillows ugly sheets etc no matter how pricey the hotels are i highly recommend this hotel,5.0
sure its clean and spacious but,yes the location is not great i did not feel okay about walking anywhere from there and seattle is a walking city price was reasonable for a night stay and the staff at the front desk were friendly room was large and kitchen was well equipped bathroom was acceptable all in all feel that it is a good place to stay unless you want to walk somewhere,4.0
the best place to stay in seattlehands down,university inn has the best rooms evermedically almost pathologically clean bathroom with a tub that dont allow water all over the floor free spring water bonus keurig coffee makers recycling shampooconditionerbath gel dipsensers in shower outside balcony with access to fesh air if needed a location that is easy to get to close to great thai american and italian cuisine and free and ample parking only things that were average is the internet wifi is slow and the breakfast has limited items if they only added some fresh fruit to the breakfast it would be absolutely perfect fitness room is at adjoining hotel which seems to work ok,5.0
worst hotel ive ever stayed in,"where do i even begin
1 we booked a two bed room 3 months ago and when we checked in they sold out of double beds but upgraded us to a king from a queen no going from two beds to one is not an upgrade especially when youre a married couple sleeping with two kids
2 our room was not nice at all our bathroom had paint peeling off of the walls and rust everywhere the shower curtain did not cover the entire side of the shower so our floor would flood finally every night we went to sleep our sheets felt damp i dont know why i dont know how but i didnt like it
3 we got back to the hotel one night pretty late and the kids were ready for bed needless to say our keys would not work and we had to wait for twenty minutes for someone to let us into our room 
4 our last night we ate in the hotel i ordered lobster rolls and was served a cheeseburger after sending it back i finally got my lobster rolls 30 minutes later and they were horrible i have never eaten food that didnt taste like anything in my life it was like chewing on air or something anyway i had 3 lobster rolls and ate less than half of one and they still tried to charge me 18 for them i told them i wasnt going to pay for something that wasnt good and that i didnt even eat anyway
terrible service terrible food terrible rooms that is what you will get if you stay at the roosevelt",1.0
you get what you pay for,"we got a great deal on our 5night stay but we regretted not paying a little more for a better experience elsewhere our main gripes were the following
 they were way too short staffed on the first couple days and so breakfast was a real mess you had to stand for 15 minutes to get a table they were out of coffee and most of the food we had to go to starbucks to get a real breakfast i mean come on if you cant even provide coffee at breakfast youre failing on the very basics of hospitality
 one reason we had picked this hotel is that parking rates were reasonable 25 however we were charged an extra 5 per day due to our oversized vehicle ford expedition i would have liked to know that beforehand having said that parking valets were great and fast
 beds not very comfortable
 never changed the sheets id expect that after about 3 days
 only 3 towels in a 4person room minor annoyance but annoying
but again it was decent for what we paid and location was pretty good despite some homeless people in the nearby streets we felt relatively safe during the 15minute walk to union square",3.0
if you want to feel pamperedtry this,over the years i have stayed at the eliot suites hotel many times for medical conferences in boston it cannot be beat for attention to detail its personal touches the large and elegant newlydecorated suites the courtesy and professionalism of staff the cleanliness and comfort of the beds and its two five star restaurants clio a formal californiacontinental restaurant and uno a more casual japanese bar gym facilities are available for guests another important feature for me is its proximity to major conference meeting halls in downtown boston and shopping on newberry street all within pleasant walking distance additional upgrades greet the traveller with every visit,5.0
speachless business or family,i stay at a hotel almost weekly for business and also on a regular basis for family trips throughout the county the commonwealth hotel has to be one of my top 3 picks if not my top pick the service is unmatchable the friendly staff is always a pleasure the rooms are beautiful extremely well kept and comfortable the best part is that all this never changes the experience has been the same from my first stay a year ago to my most recent stay last week the times i have taken my family the staff has given extra attention to my 5 and 7 year old by remembering their names throughout the stay i could go on and on but you need to go experience this one of a kind hotel yourself,5.0
wonderfully sensitive service,i arrived at the hyatt at olive 8 for the mla conference and was horrified to find that i had been given a room with no bathtub as an older woman relaxing in a warm bath is an important stress reliever for me and a normal part of my day when i was young a room with just a shower was called a half bath and you only found them in the cheapest motels but i now have come to understand that modern people dont take baths only showers so this new hotel was built without many tubs i tried to be a good sport but felt unhappy laurie at the front desk picked up on this and decided to upgrade me to a suite with a spa bath it could not have been more lovely in addition to a generally sensitive and helpful staff this hotel has everything anyone could want its very clean quiet and beautifully appointed the beds are comfortable the artwork attractive the restaurant is also very good i do plan to return and when i do ill make sure when i book that my room has a tub,5.0
good value better than expected,"much nicer than expected pleasant helpful staff nice room and very good value for money overall reasonable breakfast short 5 min walk to shopping and applebees and about 10 minute easy walk to andrew t station 
the area is not overly fancy and while walking is fine during the day there are not a lot of people around after hours if you have any concerns a cab ride at time of writing was 6 from downtown a small price for peace of mind 
they also have a shutte to airport for nominal fare
overall excellent value for money and nice place to stay",4.0
excellent stay and great service would love to return,christine was very helpful and help made our stay even better,4.0
stay elsewhere,staff is pleasant but theres where it ends dead bolt wouldnt lock on door coffee maker had not been emptied from previous guest bedside lamps would not light with new bulbs and no maintenance people in the evening,2.0
fabulous hotel in an excellent location,stayed here in june it was the third and final stop on our honeymoon from the moment we arrived we were treated very well we were upgraded to a suite without even asking and were greeted to a champagne reception with fresh fruit when we got to our room we ate in the bar that night as it was late when we arrived it was really busy but service was good food is good and hearty pub grub little on the expensive side but portions are huge potato skins with guiness porterhouse cheese are fab breakfast wasnt included but there are many places to eat within walking distance grand central station is just a two min walk away so its in a great location we walked to times square in 15 mins staff are really friendly and helpful bed and pillows were so comfortable i would definately stay here again,5.0
first timers to nyc,stayed for a week from memorial weekend great location just 2 min walk to time square no problem with room on 23rd floor looking at hudson river checkin was quick and the guy cheking us in was very helpfullplus the cleaners took away shopping bags every day and did a good jobjust a block up from hotel on 52 street a good thai restaurant overall we had no complaints about this hotel as some people complain about anything if we come back to new york we will certainly stay here again,4.0
we really love the inn at penn,this is our third stay at the inn at penn and we love it here our daughter was married here two years ago and they did a wonderful job with the wedding and reception since then weve stayed here when visiting her most recently in july their newly remodeled rooms are just fantastic they are so clean comfortable and quiet everyone here is very helpful i used the exercise room and it has great equipment and is spotless if you have any reason to stay in the university city area this is the place to be,5.0
stinky and worn out,"sofitel  los angeles was our second stop during our 3 week vacation in the west coast coming from a four seasons hotel it was a definite downgrade our expectations werent too high given the fact that were not spending that much on our stay in this hotel however given this is still a four star hotel and ranked 11 for la on trip advisor we thought it shouldnt be too bad
bell boys
as soon as i stepped out of the cab i overheard the bell boy complaining to his fellow worker man these bags are heavy well i dragged them all by myself through 3 different airports and im a size 6 woman
lobby  front desk
i wandered around the lobby while my husband was checking us in the tables had finger prints all over them and the black supposedly cool surfaces didnt look that clean the flowers werent fresh and the carpets were too worn out before giving us the room keys the front desk lady asked someone to go do a final check on the room why would they do that in front of the guests arent they supposed to have the room ready well before the guests are about to check in this makes it seem like the housekeeping doesnt always do their jobs thoroughly and that someone has to check after their work
room  hallways
when the elevator opened its doors to the floor our room is in i smelled something was off when i got into the room i thought this is definitely some really strong detergent trying to cover a very unpleasant smell like an old carpet that has been puked on and cleaned way too many times to my horror when i took off my shoes i stepped on a wet spot of the carpet i hate dark full carpets in hotel rooms in the first place only god knows what sorts of germs guests leave in them let alone one thats wet in patches i thought theres no way i was gonna be able to stay in that room too much longer so we went straight back to the front desk and requested another room telling them that the reason was because it smelled the front desk was very apologetic kind and helpful and didnt hesitate to give us another room right away we took the key to try out the other room which was in a lower floor but slightly larger the smell wasnt that bad its at least something you might get used to if you stayed for long enough
bathroom
the shower didnt drain very well i had to get off after 15 minutes or else the water wouldve overflown i reported this the next morning and it was fixed during the day while we were out all toiletries i expected were available including nailfilers which not many hotels ive been to provide
bed
the bed didnt look too welcoming the sheets were yellowish and didnt have that feel of crisp new white sheets that i so look forward to in hotels however i did sleep throughout the night so nothing about the bed bothered me during my sleep
breakfast
the breakfast was included in our stay which i think was well worth it it was a menu breakfast instead of a buffet but you could order anything you wanted for 50person anything beyond that would be charged however we ate there comfortably for 3 mornings and it never exceeded 50 the breakfast staff of the restaurant were friendly and the service was fast i loved the food too everything was fresh and good quality
concierge
the concierge didnt really know to suggest things to do to our liking i asked what was there to do in la besides shopping it was still too early for nightlife he pointed out a few museums but that was it when we asked where the best spot would be to take a good picture of the hollywood sign he showed a corner on the map we marked it on our navigation and drove there but then decided to get closer to the sign and found out there are a dozen better places for a picture
lost  found
on the last day while i was packing my bags i realized that i was missing a jacket i thought i mustve left it in the first room that was too stinky to stay in so i called the lost  found and asked if there was a jacket left in that room they said yes and brought it right away then i though what if i completely forgot that jacket wouldve they called me to inform that i might have forgotten an item in a room that i checked into before we stayed there for four nights i forgot the jacket on the first night and they neglected informing me about it ive forgotten a jacket in a dorm room after a semesters end in collage and they called me afterwards so that i could claim it this is a four star hotel
the hotel was trying too hard to be cool with the style and furnishing but at the bottom of it its just stinky and not very well maintained which only makes it look cheap a wide flat screen tv is not the solution to a modern hotel
weve stayed in another sofitel hotel before and that wasnt that great either so i guess this will put an end to our stays in sofitel",1.0
reservation mgr craig solved problem,"this hotel is in a great locationthe staff all did a great job with wonderful attitudges however craig the rsv mgr resolved an
issue we had with our booking and we left with a very pleasant
experience this is an old hotel though impeccable therefore the rooms are small the most difficult is in the bathroom with
very little shelving to put personal items",5.0
wonderful time,i was there alone and the room is a single although small it was compact and comfortable with a good bed and roomy shower the elevator was definitely a oneperson experience but it worked fine the staff were very helpful and i loved the neighborhood i will definitely plan on staying here again,5.0
i wouldnt even take a cheep prostitute here,"i was in chicago w no hotel reservations the weekend of pitchfork so every hostel was booked my boyfriend and i came across this historicrun down hotel that didnt look too bad and it was only 35night
do not let the lobby fool you back in the 30s it was beautiful with marble floors and high ceilings the man at the front desk was literally in his 90s but once you step out of the elevator all bets are off
it had the worst water damage ive ever seen in a building ever there were crackheads everywhere the sheets were totally stained with who knows what white dried substances on just about everything tub did not work but i would not have touched it anyways the building swayed with the wind and it wasnt even a windy day 
we went to explore got about 10 feet and saw a sign on our neighbors door that read stay out of my room and leave my stuff alone or ill kill you this is your last warning 
we stayed about 3 hours then got the hell out of there looking back it was so horrific that im glad i stayed there because its a good story to tell friends",1.0
great location good service could do better,i was pleased in the end a few issues over reservations and room allocation were very quickly sorted my laundry didnt come back when promised but again the staff sorted it as soon as it became an issue good managers who jumped on any issue and resolved quickly good for business and leisure trips,4.0
location,"ok so its a shared bathroom and shower but where is it right next to bleeker st and washington sq park  so your in the heart of the village you can walk to everything that you could possibly want and need
great for what ever  exploring the city or just for staying to the local area and what a local area  this is the greatest area in nyc 
its a real leafy brwonstone street that has you halfway between 5th and 6th and you can soak up it all go to 5th and wander up to the empire state or down to the park or go onto 6th and just soak up the atmosphere bars restaurants and everything in between here at the end of the street is a newsagents where you can get your morning paper or magazine before heading to somewhere for coffee then wander to the subway on 7th to explore the city come back in the evening and then head a couple of blocks south to the heart of the area and find bar after bar and restaurant and have a great night out
forgot to eat thats ok theres a couple of pizza places open 24 hrs to get a slice this is just a great place to explore and its cheap cheap cheap
they will store you luggage also before your room is ready and for the day after you check out brilliant stay",4.0
great stay,"stayed st the w city center for a fun weekend getaway and loved it i mentioned to our conceirge tk that we were celebrating a birthday and we got a sweet treat delivered to our room what a great surprise nice touch tk

a great little hotel,"we stayed at the nob hill motel for three days at the beginning of october 06 it was a well presented and very clean hotel set in a very good location this enabled easy access to all the sites you would usually visit in san fransisco they have free covered parking beneath the rooms which is watched by close circuit tv so your car will be safe whilst you stay the hotel is run by a very friendly couple who will give you all the advise you need to enjoy a perfect stay which will include where the best places to eat and drink are located how to safely get to all the tourist destinations and will even tell you where to avoid to stay safe they really are friendly hosts and nothing is to much trouble for them
the room we stayed in was well equiped and spottlessly clean but was a little cramped when you need to be living out of two suitcases as we were when we toured california although they do have larger rooms and i would recommend reserving one of these if you are to stop longer than one night
i would not hesitate to return to the nob hill hotel if i was to return to san fransisco",4.0
great stay but some noise issues,"everything thats been said about this hotel is true its a great location round the corner of the no 1 subway which will get you to the most important tourist hotspots and just a few blocks from penn34st street station for all business puposes cabs are not hard to find 7th down and 8th for uptown travel just walk towards any corner 
staff is great efficient and polite this is not however your new england bb but it doesnt pretend to be breakfast is a zoo when full but is provided with swift service so you dont have to wait for food very long if they are out 
bathroom is great new and big enough 4 people in a room would be more than a squeeze though if you have however stayed at a london or paris budget hotel this is the ritz
one big issue for me is the lack of soundproofing or at least the doors not being soundtight at all it wouldnt matter if you had the door wide open youd hear the same slamming doors the whole night people talking in the hallways etc if this bothers you you should really consider another hotel we moved twice and although the staff were very helpfull it did not solve the noise problem so bought earplugs and turned on the airconditioning to drown out the sound but still no better streetnoise is virtually non exitent due to great double glassed windows why dont you guys just finish it all off by putting in they right doors
if they get the sound issues straightend out i would give them a 10 out of 10 
so all in all
if youre a light sleeper move on
if you want to sleep cheap in a great bed with good morning food in a good location in a great new room and a smile on the staffs faces stay here",4.0
sofitel on capital hill,sofitel is a nice hotel with a great location the staff are helpful and friendly i did not eat in the restaurant so no opinion on that the room was comfortable but not fantastic it was certainly above average i got a good price for such a convenient location i think others in dc are a little more spacious and nicely appointed but i recommend this hotel,4.0
stay here and be happy,"stay here and be happy 
we loved this hotel we had a 2 bdrm suite on the 11th floor this is a great histroic hotel in a great locale walking distance to beale st and all that downtown has to offer 
we got in early we had a 1 bdrm reserved we wanted an upgrade to a 2 bdrm which was not ready but the front desk was so nice we went to a little place down the road had an appetizer and when we got back our bags were in the room and all was good with the world 
it was like the front desk folks were old friends they wanted out sstay to be the best it could be the workout room was nice and the am breakfast was super the lending library had some super books and movies and we got a game to play 
this is a great place in a city that is on the upswing take the horse drawn carriage ride and see how memphis is rebuilding a downtown 
would i stay here again yes indeed",5.0
a fun neighborhood experience,we stayed for three days at the hotel tomo we usually stay in the luxury hotels downtown but this time wanted a more neighborhood experience this fit the bill the hotel was clean and rooms were sufficeint there were no frills but we spent very little time in our room so why pay for things you dont use this hotel is two blocks from fillmore street where there are a lot of great restaurants and shops it is situated in japantown which had some interesting shops and restaurants but would not be considered a destination the mainline bus stop was across the street so it made for a good base overall a good experience,3.0
chic urban sophistication,"ive loved this hotel for years staying there many times in its previous incarnation as the rihga royal the allsuite layout boasts a promiscuous use of space by nyc hotel standards the recent renovations provided the polish and sophistication befitting a top notch luxury hotel combine that with world class dining perfect location and efficient courteous service and you have one of the best choices in the highly competitive nyc luxury hotel market 
only one issue marred my otherwise flawless stay when i arrived i was taking my rollerbag out of the taxi the doorman attempted to take it from me i said no worries  ive got it he insisted wrestling the bag out of my hands and then rolling the 30 pound bag to the check in desk less than 20 feet away while the agent at the desk was welcoming me and asking for my credit card and id he stood there staring at me eventually i realized that he had no intention of leaving without a tip nor did he intend to help me with the baggage to the room 20 feet of unwanted assistance and then he demands a tip while tipping has historically been customary with nyc bellman it is a rarity elsewhere on the planet but even if you allow that tips are traditional this sort of aggressive behavior verges on a scam and is unworthy of an otherwise lovely hotel",4.0
perfect place to stay,"my husband and i had one night to stay in seattle and found a special rate at the andra hotel what a great choice it turned out to be not only was the location superb within walking distance of shopping restaurants and pikes place the room appointments were very nice and the service was excellent we arrived early and our room was not yet ready but they were happy to park our car and store our luggage while we went exploring upon our return our room was ready and the luggage was brought up we were very pleased with the room  an extremely comfy bed nice streamlined furnishings a very european feel to the bath and a separate closetdressing table area very upscale it was nice to have a docking station for our ipod and theres a cooler full of bagged ice in the hall near the elevator nice for coolers and chilling the wine 
the front desk gave us some good restaurant recommendations in the area but we found an irish pub kells just a few blocks away in post alley that had some wonderful seafood specials that night the best part of the evening was returning to andra and going into lolas for martinis the bartender made an excellent cosmo we would certainly stay here again",5.0
good location  spacious rooms,"stayed here for a weekend currently the place is redoing their pool area i believe they said it would be completed in april or so our room had a king size bed and was spacious good view out the balcony as we saw some fun times 
my partner and i are gay so this hotel was close to the bars hamburger marys was a happening place flicks on friday is great deals with the 200 drinks happy hour from 56pm at sommerset was good transportation provided to and from airport was also good they also have transporation to the zoo this place isnt high end but for the price and location you cant beat it",3.0
pretty good what youd expect,"for the class and type of hotel this is good but not excellent its a pretty vast hotel 
on my visit the first room i checked into was dark and looked onto a huge ventilation system couple of yards away i then asked to be moved and was given a room which had not been cleaned or touched since the previous occupier rubbish left on the floor bed unmade etc etc  finally got a reasonable corner room with a view it was comfortable though dated 
i was there for a conference so didnt make full use of the leisure restautant faciltlies however appeared ok 
great location nr michigan ave navy pier i would stay again however think the hyatt regency on whacker drive  2 mins away has more of a buzz and a better bar",3.0
left electronic toothbrush  and now its mia,"liked the hotel pretty cool concept all in all and perfect for business travels only complaint is i accidentally left my electronic toothbrush in the room after checking with lostfound 2xno luck clearly housekeeping took it and passed it along to someone who knows who would want an old toothbrush is beyond me but it makes me wonder whatelse theyd take or refuse to return to hotel guests think about it 
hotel was pretty indifferent to the fact i can understand on some level but perhaps the gm and leadership team should educate housekeeping on the proper protocol makes me not want to ever stay here again and i am in dallas alot for business",2.0

we had a great time,my family and i were in town for a wedding and our stay was great everyone one was very nice and accomodating they have a great breakfast buffet for a very reasonable price the location is great we went to a really nice steakhouse that the concierge recommended and it was amazing they took great care of us  they even bought us an appetizer my family and i had a great time at the crowne plaza and we will be back,5.0
clean  spacious,"i stayed at the beverly hills plaza hotel for 3 nights while on business the hotel looks a bit dated but was clean desk service valet room service were all attentive and polite
i stayed in a huge one bedroom suite that looked like an apartment rather than a normal hotel room the room had a good sized kitchen and would have been great if my family was with me 
the bathroom was very clean and that is one of my pet peeves when judging hotels i cannot stand any cracked marble or tiles dirty grout corroded chrome areas etc this bathroom was spotless
the bed was very comfortable and firm however my room faced wilshire blvd and the street noise was terrible i would suggest some sort of weather stripping or something that would seal the edges better to keep the street noise out my first night was miserable due to meeting anxiety and hearing the street noise that would be my only complaint about this hotel
we had a really good rate of 225night for a one bedroom deluxe suite so it was an excellent value as well",4.0
super 8 is super great,"i cannot say enough good things about this hotel there is nothing like a good nights rest when you are on vacation and every night of our stay was great the ceiling fan in the room made a huge difference austin can be quite warm and humid so it was so nice to have a cool comfortable room to retire to at the end of the day and the bed was actually comfortable not like most places weve stayed 
i am very picky when it comes to hotels this is one of the very few that measure up as far as im concerned the staff was so friendly there was a variety of breakfast options in their eating area ate something different each time and the rooms were always more than adequately cleaned 
at the end of our 10 hour drive to austin my husband sat in the massage chair in the lobbyhe rates that a 10 especially after a day of driving that was a nice surprise 
the only thing that i can think of thats a con is that its a little ways away from the action in austin but that is also a plus since it was nice and quiet",5.0
ok hotel if you are on a budget,"happy new year everyone
just returned from a 7 day trip our taxi from jfk accidentally took us to the hotel peninsula when we got to our hotel we wish we had got out at the peninsula 
firstly the building itself is very impressive and as many have said the lobby is beautiful
on exiting the lift a strange musty smell hits you but thats easy to live with we werent impressed with the room what so ever we were up for asking for another room but decided to wait till morning we had a good night sleep and the maids cleaned the room and got new towels we decided we would stick with it
as i say the hotel is perfect for anyone on a budget in other words if you have come to new york for the sights and not the hotel its acceptable",2.0

steven the front desk employee went out of his way to put me in a better mood and it certainly worked 
then the rooms were beautiful and very well styled i stay in many hotel rooms across the country and its so nice to not have to worry about whether or not your room is clean it was spotless comfortable had all the amenities
great experience with this hotel im totally recommending it to others and my family in the city",5.0
peace and comfort,we arrived in seattle just before thanksgiving for 2 days of exploring downtown unfortunately my husband had a bad cold so he did little wandering however if he had to be sick the sheraton was a good place to bevery comfortable bed nice tv screen to watch football and the inhotel restaurant was delicious the hotel is within easy walking distance of most of downtown so i enjoyed checking out shops and bay scenery the hotel is also just 2 blocks from the westlake station of the light rail from the airport well return,5.0
the best deal in boston,my family and i stayed at this hotel for a couple nights because 1 it was the cheapest hotel in boston and 2 it was a block from my brothers apartment the hotel room was very nice though the first room we got the thermostat was set at 95 so it was boiling we were given a different room one that was much cooler the next morning the hot water for the entire building was down the breakfast was good with a very good selection other than the few minor setbacks at the beginning of our stay the hotel was wonderful good rooms and service in a good location,4.0
clean comfortable and close to walking sites downtown,we stayed for four nights at the hotel five and were very pleased with the customer service and cleanliness of the room wish they had a complimentary breakfast but they did have a restaurant nearby with complimentary coffee always available it was also near a great donut store top pot within easy walking distance we will stay there again on our next visit to seattle,4.0

charming great location,"the palace hotel is beautiful my husband and i and our 2 daughters spent 4 nice nights at this splendid hotel the location is great its just a short walk to incredible shopping chinatown and great restaurants the moment we got out of our car the service was nothing short from great they took care of our bags and our car as we proceeded to checkin we had reserved a one bedroom suite which turned out to be quite nice we were a little nervous about the noise as an aquaintance had just stayed at the palace and said that the walls were a bit thin i inquired at the desk about the noise and they assured us it would not be a problem with our room 
the suite itself had a great old world charm to it the rooms were clean although the sofa in the living room needed a good cleaning and the king bed was extremely comfortable the bellman unloaded our luggage to their respective places showed us the room and welcomed us to the hotel the only problem we had with the room was that they gave us a king instead of 2 doubles so our daughters had nowhere to sleep i immediately called the front desk they quickly apologized for the mixup and said they would send up two complimentary rollaways the rollaways were brought up within 10 minutes of the call and fit perfectly in the livingroom since the room was quite large
the concierge service was very nice they were very helpful in recommending restaurants and making reservations and giving directions the steakhouse in the hotel maxfields was decent not overly great but we didnt want to walk to a restaurant outside the hotel after walking all day long we ordered room service for our daughters a couple of nights so that my husband and i could go out on our own they enjoyed it  and loved eatting in the room while they watched high school musical 2 
the front desk was correct our room was relatively quiet the mixup with the beds worked out great since it gave both my husband and i and our daughters privacy after a long day of being tourists my daughters found the long hallways a bit spooky but they enjoyed themselves as well well definately stay there again if we return to san francisco",4.0
labor day weekendgreat location,this hotel was great for the price given the location it is so close to so many things  very close to public transportation spots on the down side for what i thought was such a highend hotel the cleanliness of their room was questionable when we checked in we noticed a huge stain on one of the pillows  on the bed was very disappointed to find that everything else was fine the bathroom tube was smaller than what i thought  the view wasnt great but i did book through priceline  was getting the most for my buck one warning on priceline it states you can pay more to get internet access but that is not the case we had to pay the hotel for internet access we are going to call priceline to see what they can do for us for that inconvenience besides that everyone was friendly  extremely helpful staff really aiming to please,4.0
far beyond our expectations,"the marriott financial in terms is kind of a calm and quit hideaway on manhattan island we slept in more than comfortable beds and had beautiful views over the hudson and ellis island our room has been astonishingly clean so that you could feel like home using the bath and bed after a long day of sightseeing and shopping the marriott is located in an absolutely safe and quiet part of downtown so that we had a peaceful and undisturbed sleep during each night breakfast at roys has been a good start into our day but if someone wants to he could also find many quality breakfast cafes and restaurants close to the hotel subway station is a 3 min stroll away and within just 15 min after locking your room youre right in the middle of times square its the same time with a cab ride for which we never paid more than 15 tofrom uptown
many of the world renowm tourists sites are near the hotel like battery park the ferry to statue of liberty wall street the woolworth building and pier 17 not to mention ground zero which is just a block away and a mustgo to remember and give a prayer 
after listening to so many horrible stories about even more horrible nyc hotels that our friends and family experienced before us we were more than relieved to realize that the marriott financial is a real 4star hotel with all amenities one would expect we were lucky to get rates for a kingbed room which havent been higher than the rates for all the dirty and rundown 2star tourist hotelcages uptown so the marriott financial made our stay in new york an unforgettable nice one 
highly recommend it",5.0
service so bad i cancelled my reservations,booked this hotel as part of a package with expedia one week prior to arrival i emailed them requesting a cot for my teenager three days later i had not received a response so i called the front desk and made the request the rude guy who took my call informed me it would 3000 per night for a cot when i told him i thought that was pretty steep he said talk to the manager thats our policy based on their inability to accommodate my request and the complete lack of hospitality i cancelled my stay and booked another hotel,1.0
ditto bring your earplugs,i recognize new york is noisy and while youre up high in the hilton millenium construction at ground zero can be pretty loud even on a weekend the rooms are very clean and for business travellers to downtown the location couldnt be better its a bit overpriced but which hotel in new york is not,3.0
hard times befall the bijou,"perhaps the bijou was a good place when it opened but its fallen on hard times the upholstery and curtains in the lobby and the rooms are grimy the location is very dicey and the rooms facing the street are incredibly noisy all night longsirens shouting etcwhich means you cannot open the windows and the rooms are stuffyno ac or fan
internet access is available through att and i was horrified to find that when i signed on i had access to other guests hard drives parking is an additional 30day in an offsite lot not bad for sf but i waited 45 minutes for my car to be brought around there are no security locks on the rooms just door handle locks no wall outlets near the desk for your laptop the wall lamps above the bed are mounted so low you cannot sit up in bed to read 
apparently the bijou used to be part of the joie de vivre group of boutique hotels but is no longer it has not kept it up very well its cheap but not a good value for your money",2.0
perfect base for seeing the city,"we stayed here for 4 nights in october 2007 and it was absolutely brilliant we had a queen pod on the 11th floor which was ensuite so no need to share the facilities as on the lower floors absolutely spotless great housekeeping and a really funky and fresh design 
the rooftop area was fab for unwinding after a long day sightseeingshopping
location was pretty spot on  only a few blocks walk to the heart of the city and there was a subway stop at the end of the next block
we had room 1104  which had a private outdoor area with great views also ideal for smokers as the hotel is non smoking
there seemed to be a diverse clientele  older couples young travllers europeans other americans  everyone seemed to love it
overall id recommend to everyone",4.0
renovation going on,i found the motel overall to be very good my room was very clean and up to date the ac worked perfect and was pretty quiet not at all annoying the front desk staff was friendly and very accomodating i was there for 5 nights i did have a couple of small issues that the staff took care of immediately the motel is about 1520 min from downtown a very easy drive in the morning and afternoon both there was some renovation going on in the lobby hallway areas but nothing that interfered with my stay the breakfast was not anything fancy but it sure beat driving thru somewhere,4.0
this hotel was terriblea real ripoff,we stayed at the westin oaks hotel in houston in february 2009 it was the worst experience of my life the air conditioner was blowing hot air all night long so finally we just opened the patio door and sweated all night also there was not enough hot water to take a shower so we just got up at 300 am to drive on home which was five hours away you would think if you paid 50000 for a room it would at least be cool air and hot water i would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy thank you do not stay here,1.0
wonderful home away from home,we were in austin for the marathon so the addition of a kitchen was very convenient the room was great the breakfast that was included was really good we will stay there again,4.0
pleasantly surprised,"i picked this hotel because i was able to get a good rate and the location is very convenient having stayed at cq in philadelphia i was expecting another small room but the room i got in dc was very spacious  luck of the draw i guess very clean front desk staff was ok only problem was that the inroom coffee maker didnt work well a big plus was the lighting  desk and bed lamps had 3way bulbs which made it really easy to read unlike dim bulbs in many hotel rooms
location right on top of one metro station and near another was also a plus firehook bakery a block away on 17th st is excellent for breakfast the area is pretty dead at night for better or worse",4.0
much better than i expected,i gotta admit on the trip up to nyc i was getting a little nervous about this hotel as i was reading some of the reviews we stayed there four nights and were truly happier than i thought we would be with our experience there sure the rooms and bathroom are small but they put the square footage of the rooms on their website so that was no surprise the room wasnt so small that we were uncomfortable at all we got one of the renovated rooms and i loved the decor it was simple and i love when hotels have allwhite bedding the hotel was such a convenient walk to everywhere we wanted to go when we looked out our window we could see the reflections of time squares lights on the other buildings the theater we went to was in the same block as the hotel so that was nice and it was only maybe a 10 minute walk to rockefeller center at most the rooms were so quiet we didnt hear any noise at all from the hotel only street noise but its new york city what do you expect if you go here expecting crazy luxury you are not going to find it but if you want a nice clean and quiet room with a short walk to theaters time square or rockefeller center this hotel is perfect we would happily stay here again,4.0
town and country is excellent terry ng from front desk is amazing,room is wonderful service is world class especially from the front desk,5.0
great location beside space needle  5 minutes from downtown on sky train,clean reasonably priced  we picked eat sleep and park package  decent deal great buffet breakfast helpful friendly staff overall good for 1 or 2 night stop over in seattle,3.0
really nice hotel but a bit overpriced for what it is,went to seattle for the chargersseahawks football game splurged on hotel at olive 8 because it got great reviews online it was nice certainly but nothing super fancy my fiance thought the late night happy hour in the bar was superb the rooms walls were a bit bare and it almost had this feel like they just opened when we got there we were told the only way we could get a good view would be to upgrade since we booked directly with the hotel we were already paying full price for the room and opted not to our room faced an office building which we could see right ito you can easily walk to our hotel from the public market so the location was greatjust not sure the hotel was worth the money,3.0
much better this time,stayed here 2 years ago and wasnt impressed then stayed again this past september and was fantastic experience everyone went out of their way to be accomodating the room was spacious and clean the toilet clogged during the stay but they came up within 10 minutes and fixed it though could have cleaned up after themselves when they did the valet parking was quick and efficient the front staff was kind courteous and went out of their way to make sure we had directions and everything we needed well done and will definitely stay again,5.0
not bad if youre exhibiting or attending a convention at mccormick,"the rooms are pretty solid and definitely for business travelers if you are attending or exhibiting there the convenience is unbeaten they just added a minifridge which is good for those who like to stock their rooms during these trips do stock plenty of water since the air quality will dry you up like a prune during sleep unfortunately they have not upgraded their tvs yet and have a terrible channel selection the sauna pool and gym is not bad at all for a business hotel the concierge is pretty solid when they are around they also have auto checkin and checkout but there is no flexibility with changing your room using the machine the store at the hotel is a complete ripoff unlike many other midwest hotel stores the markup is incredible  especially the booze and refreshments the inhotel bar provides the best value for the food there there are many tvs at the bar just in case you are a sports fan 
about the convention center the food is slim pickins so be warned for a normal lunch you will spend close to 20 they have a cafeteria with hot food which is the most expensive and a connies and mcdonalds on the lower level truthfully the mcdonalds is the only food establishment there that is not a complete ripoff tip  the taxi line is much shorter at the hotel entrance as opposed to the convention center entrance",4.0
great location but a few little things,"trying to find an affordable hotel in boston can be quite a challenge we took advantage of starwoods second night 12 price promo at the westin copley place
we arrived at 930 in the morning and were planning to have our bags stowed for the day happily our room was ready and we were able to move from two queens to a king bed that wasnt available when i booked online 
the room size is adequate and the bathroom is fine the shower head is very 1980s as noted by a previous post the tub was worn but the room was clean the main issue is the soundproofing at this hotel we could hear our neighbours sneezing and coughing and their cell phone conversations word for word when they checked out early they forgot to reset their alarm clock which we could hear through the wall for hours
the location of this hotel cant be beat its very central and a block from the nearest tstop its extremely simple to get to the westin from the airport using public transit there are several decent restaurants if you cant make it out for dinner 
the concierge service at the hotel is great they could answer every question and gave great advice regarding local diners and restaurants 
if the rooms had updated soundproofing we would stay again otherwise well stay in the same area at another hotel",3.0
i know the city is overcrowded and dirty but seriously its the hilton,"i was up north visiting my husband on the weekend of the 12th through the 15th of august while he was out of town for business we had booked a hotel room at the hilton in the city because we were visiting friends for a couple nights as well 
on a saturday at 6pm we made our way to the hilton only to be told our room was not ready and they were still cleaning it we were fine with waiting because they gave us drink vouchers for the bar plus the decor was so nice and plush we didnt mind hanging around downstairs to wait we were on a time schedule though and had to be back at our friends house by 8 so we waited about 20 minutes and they came and got us and sent us up to our room
the first thing we always do whenever we get a hotel in any city is strip the bed and check everything for bed bug signs which is exactly what we did we didnt find any bed bugs but we did find a pubic hair a clearish white stain and a brown stain on the sheets by this time we only had an hour to shower iron our clothes and get where we needed to go so i called downstairs and told them what happened they did send an apologetic person up to change the sheets and remake the bed
it was quite obvious the room had not been cleaned at all the floor had not been vacuumed and the bed was nasty i was pissed because
a we are hilton honors members and even if we werent i would still expect a certain level of cleanliness from a hilton
b check in for most of these hotels is generally 3 or 4 so i was a little miffed when she showed up at 6 and they had no room for us
c they obviously lied to us when they said they were cleaning the room because they werent
d even though we didnt pay for the room we used hilton points my husband had saved up for a fun trip and we basically wasted them on a bed filled with bodily fluids
like i said i knew new york was a dirty overcrowded city so i sort of knew what to expect but i didnt expect it would be that gross",2.0
a good value hotel in the heart of times square,"we stayed for 5 nights and were very pleased with the hotel couldnt get over how close it was to the very centre of times square just 70 metres away check in was quick our room was smallish but clean and comfortable a basic airconditioner was in the room not sure how efficient it would be in the middle of summer though bathroom was very large coffee machine was provided in the room and you could also help yourself at any time to tea and coffee in the breakfast room a very good free continental breakfast was provided with cereal fruit pastries toast and yoghurt make sure you tip the attendant though
the hotel was close to public transport which we used all the time theres also a tiny gym with treadmill which you really dont need just walk everywhere whilst in new york free internet was also available in a small business centre in the lobby all in all a great place to stay whilst visiting the big apple",4.0
excellent location great service,"my mom and i stayed at the fairfax for three nights we got the room on priceline for 150 and i think we had the same room as the other priceline reviewer below king with pull out sofa they got a better price than us though  anyway we did not feel any less welcome due to our priceline status
the pullout sofa was comfortable and the bed was so comfy service was excellent the door people are so friendly we asked a couple of times for extra coffee and it was delivered immediately and with a smile the bathroom was very spacious tons of counter space free standing hairdrying vs the hose attached to the wall excellent water pressure and hot water through two showers 
the location just could not be any better dupont circle metro is right there and it is right near tons of excellent restaurants barsclubs if you want nightlife bookstores shopping excellent consignment shop at secondi embassy row we didnt eat at the jockey cllub but did have some drinks in the farifax lounge
for the priceline price this was an outstanding value and we really enjoyed it",4.0
beautiful hotel with a view of coronado,stayed at his hotel for three nights  everything was just fantastic the spa pool was awesome perfect location for walking to seaport village gaslamp uss midway etc the lobby and lobby bar were just great very clean because of the many events taking place there the elevators were really tied up during peak times nothing to take away from this beautiful hotel though,5.0
excellant choice for early morning flight,we have stayed at the crowne plaza several times in the past when we had an early morning flight this time we were very pleased with the recently refurbished rooms the food in the first floor restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced a good start to our vacation,4.0
excellent location and wonderful staff,"my husband and i booked a night with pricelines name your own price feature and our bid was picked up by the marriott wardman park i was nervous at first because i saw this whole huge story about some major gop convention having been there in january and everyone having bedbug bites understandably i kind of freaked out and i contacted the management with my concerns they replied promptly and courteously gave me quite a bit of info on how they deal with those kinds of situations and apparently the story was rather unfounded so we decided to give it a shot upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the extremely nice front desk staff and allowed to check in 2 hours early our room was neat and clean with the exception of one old pillow which i removed from the bed we inspected every inch of the room for bedbugs and found absolutely nothing everything was spotless true as many reviewers before have pointed out there was no view from the room and the towels were scratchy but i wasnt there to gaze out the window and the towels were clean so i didnt care i didnt observe any nasty attitudes from any of the hotel staff despite having read reviews about it before going in fact every person on staff that i dealt with was exceedingly nice and helpful
all in all this was a great hotel its across from the metro has beautiful gardens to walk in and allows you to be in the heart of the city without feeling bombarded by traffic all the time i would stay here again in a heart beat",4.0
awesome value and location,perfect for a few days stay checkin was a breeze the hotel is located win easy walking distance of quincy market the state house and other touristy sights staff was quite accommodating and helpful i even enjoyed the elephant bar adjacent the room was large enough for me  might have been tight for 2 or w a kid check out this value  least expensive of all in the area,4.0
not that impressed,"i was in chicago for the marathon and stayed at the w for my last night in town because i was able redeem starwood points for a free night although ive been a starwood member for a long time and stayed at many st regis sheraton  westin hotels around the world this was my first time at a w so i was excited to see what the w experience was all about
what i liked
although i arrived about 10am they had my room available and i was able to check in which was great the front desk clerk was very friendly the room was a bit small but fine the bed was very comfortable i ended up ordering dinner from room service the prices were about what you would expect but the dinner was surprisingly delicious i think this is the first room service meal that ive ever really enjoyed i had the flatten grilled chicken ceasar salad and tiramisu for dessert
what i did not like
the train is very close to the hotel and although that makes getting around very convenient you can also really hear it rumbling by every 10 minutes or so which is not that pleasant my room was a corner room with two huge window that looked directly into office buildings across the way so i had to keep the curtains closed most of the time i know it goes with the hip vibe of the hotel but it is so dark in all the public areas and even in the room that it makes it hard to see i guess that is a sign that i am now officially old one of the whatever whenever concierges was not very helpful and had a bit of any attitude when i ask her for train directions the concierge who was on duty the next day was great and helped me checkin for my flight online and printed my boarding pass for me so i guess its just a matter of who is manning the desk overall it is very loungy feeling but that is what you would expect when you stay at a w 
i much preferred the hilton on s michigan ave which i stayed at the two previous nights",3.0
convenient to all downtown fun,the view from our room was amazing jets in bathtub were relaxing easy walk to anywhere you want to go downtown il forneo restaurant has excellent food and service bed so comfy i slept like a log 14 the price of a san francisco hotel thanks to william who checked us in and out he was so friendly and helpful i definitely will stay there again,5.0
a fantastic hotel to stay at,myself and my husband recently returned from a 5 night stay at this lovely hotel everything was just perfect but if i had to say one minus its maybe that its not as close to times square as it could be the rooms are very big for nyc hotel rooms housekeeping was exceptional staff are all very friendly and polite my husband said it was the best hotel bed he has ever slept in definitely join the select guest programme its worth it for the free internet access and morning coffee concierges were all very knowledgeable and helpful if you want a great hotel then do stay here,5.0
what a dealbut not via bestwesterncom,"booked this hotel via hostelworldcom and it pulled up as aae hotels  hostels loyal inn it was much much cheaper booking this way rather than going through best westerns website
we got room 101 on the ground floor on the right side of the hotel our window overlooks the parking lot this room is right across from housekeepings staff room or supply room every morning we can hear the doors banging openshut the walls are very thin we can hear people talking in the halls and walking around in the room above us the room is also very close to the stairs that lead up stairs so a lot of traffic a lot of noise its close to the breakfast buffet room and business center
the bathroom amenities include towels and hair dryer there is soap and lotion via wall dispensers mounted on the wall over the sink there is body wash shampoo and conditioner via wall dispensers mounted on the wall in the showertub i like the curved shower curtain rod the curvature prevents the curtain from billowing inwards during the shower the shower water pressure and drainage was good the sink area is outside the bathroom area and there are limited hanging and no shelf space in the bathroom its all outside
room amenities include acheat unit coffeetea maker two very comfortable queen beds and soft pillows plenty of floor lamps fridge and microwave safe large desk and large lcd tv
there is wifi the passcode changes every monday there is a business center with 2 computers printing is free there is a gym two machines and a few weights and buffet breakfast all complimentary parking is 10 plus tax a day
the hotel is within walking distance to the rei flagship store space needle and whole foods dickys drivein a gas station and i5 are also close by not too many restaurants in the area though
when we returned from our side trip to vancouver we were given room 306 its a four level building but in this room we hardly heard any overhead noise the ac unit was changed one day it was different when we came back from our day out the set up is the same with minor differences like the hair dryer and ac unit its an overall much quieter room being on the left side of the hotel and higher up our window over looks denny park",4.0
lovely place in a convenient location,just stayed one night but everything worked smoothly and the room was excellent nice continental breakfast very close to restaurants copley square etc,4.0
better than those huge hotel monsters,"if you need to be in or near downtown houston for a couple of days dont look any further the hotel is clean the rooms are huge with huge tvs every room has a fridge and a microwave theres a complimentary breakfast and a happy hour during which you get free drinks and snacks
that is all very well but what really makes your stay at this hotel worth your money is the very personal approach of the staff of course you can go to hospitality monsters like the double tree which is actually in downtown houston and not near it but youll feel like a number like a soulless statistic out there 
so id say dont go to those horrible huuuge hotels in downtown houston just take this one youll love it",5.0
comfy beds and overall very nice,yes the trolley does run late so if you want quiet stay on side facing river but of you will be out into the late evening go for a room with balcony they are few but face the park and its a nice place to enjoy a good conversation glass of wine or breakfast loved the beds very comfortable and the kitchen with own sink was nice will stay here again,4.0
good location and basic,spent 2 days at the residence inn dupont circle in november 2011 rooms were clean and basic but a bit on the small side the kitchenette was a plus breakfast was ok but nothing special people at the front desk were very helpful location good for restaurants but a few 34 blocks from a metro station,4.0
a very nice place to stay,i stayed here for one night and it was a very nice room at a rate that is very reasonable for sf this is a quality place with all nice modern room ameneties and you wont be dissappointed i was upgraded to a king room which was very large not much street noise no trouble sleeping,4.0
management was insenstive to my needs even when my father was dying,i travel quite a bit on business overall the hotel was very nice however i received a call from my family in dallas that my father was dying he had 24 hours to live and i had an hour and 12 to book a flight and go i had been in the hotel for about 4 hours and had to leave suddently i asked the hotel staff if they would charge me they said they would talk to the manager i left in a hurry my father passed away 2 days later  and i realized the hotel still charged me for an entire day i called the mangement back and they said it did matter because they couldnt rent the room for the evening and house keeping couldnt clean it not that it even mattered bc the hotel was empty when i left he wouldnt even prorate the room for me not to mention i have status as an spg member i wil never go to this hotel ever again and i will recommend for others not to stay here they just lost a lot of busines from me too bad because i travel quite a bit i cant believe how insenstive people can be,1.0
what a nice hotel,"we just stayed 3 nights at the hotel elysee our room was spacious and beautiful we were on the 12th floor and never heard anyone although one night i did hear the garbage truck picking up outside 
the breakfast was very nice and consisted of pastries muffins scones and lots of bread choices with yummy jellies also several cereals prunes and hard boiled eggs there was a big bowl of good mixed fruit yogurt and packs of instant oatmeal also several kinds of juice 3 types of very good coffee with syrups and many tea choices 
we thoroughly enjoyed this club room throughout the day and night also stopping in now and then between our activities there were newspapers a pc with internet and a piano and tv in a smaller attached room which we always had to ourselves there was always fresh coffee tea and little cookies 
the staff was pleasant and helpful great location we would definitely stay here again",4.0

great first time in chicago ,we booked our hotel through hotwire we were a bit unsure as we would not know where we were staying until the transaction had gone through when it popped up palmer house of course we searched like crazy to find the reviews some were good some not so much so we began to regret our decisionuntil we arrived in chicago the palmer house was gorgeouswe were upgraded to a room with 2 bathrooms great for 2 girls  without even askingthe staff was courteous helpful and the atmosphere was always enjoyable our room was oldervery clean beds comfortable and the concierge was very helpful at suggesting restaurants and things to do and see the location was goodwe walked several times to the magnificint mile we would both stay there again ,4.0
always a pleasure,i recently stayed at this hotel for mothers day it was such a delight to find this gem in downtown phoenix the attention paid to every minute detail and the courtesy shown by the entire staff made this a memorable and most pleasurable experience for me and my family l must say their mothers day brunch was just as pleasureable to look at as it was delicous from filet mingnon to all of the delectable desserts they even had a cute station where the little ones could make the very own personlized cards to present to their moms and most of allit all wasnt a budget buster all in all just a beautiful experience,4.0
this is a goodie,"we spent two nights here over christmas in a loft suite no idea why they call it a loft its just a reasonably normal hotel room 
nice large bedroom with fabulous furniture plus a little dressing room and loads of wardrobe space its in a great location really close to union square for shopping
the reception is a bit different really dark with a roaring fire and lots of unique furniture there is a funky bar  great for people watching the staff here are really helpful
this is a goodie  go if you can",4.0

consistently excellent westin standards,"this is a lovely hotel perfectly located for business in downtown denver right on the 16th street mall downtown denver is very walkable so no need to rent a car unless you plan to go further afield 
check in was friendly and efficient was up to my room very quickly and it was up to the usual westin standards clean functional and understated decor  perfect for business
very nice pool with a view over downtown
overall an excellent reliable choice for business in denver",4.0
comfy beds in a great location but somewhat shabby,"i stayed here last thursday  sunday i attended a business workshop on friday and my hubby and i stayed through the weekend for leisure checkin was smooth and fast and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable the lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors the woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax 
on the positive side i liked the overal design of the room and the bedding was of nice quality but there were some serious flaws the bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off and although i asked for a nonsmoking room the place smelled strongly of smoke we are not smokers and didnt spend any time with smokers during our trip but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room when we got home and unzipped our suitcases the smell of smoke was extremely strong i had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that i had just purchased that very weekend at saks
other positives about this hotel are the location it was very convienient to magnificent mile shopping and attractions the cafe attached served great coffee and i never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order and again the staff were helpful and pleasant 
overall the room was a good value but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts",3.0
these people should be banned from the industry,"do not stay at this hellhole
i booked late on returning to here from my first leg
it is overpriced airless and disgusting and the people who run it should not be allowed near a hotel rude inconsiderate and ignorant dont cover it
i looked at the rooms and after explaining my displeasure we left
needless to say a refund was not forecoming",1.0
the best kept secret,omg this place is fantastic we are used to staying in 4  5 star hotels so i was a little worried about the boutique nature of this hotel but i was wrong the welcome from ann on reception and the fantastic advice about restaurants etc from wayne not to mention meeting other guests at the very generous wine and cheese happy hour each night really made our stay there were 3 of us and we stayed in the penthouse suite which was roomy and cozy with 2 tvs and 2 toilets there is no better location we walked to north beach for fantastic italian food at ristorante ideale and to chinatown which are both an easy and interesting 15 minute stroll we were sorry to leave the inn and will stay there again on our next visit to san fran thanks wayne and ann for your hospitality,5.0
location is tops,"husband and i stayed 5 nights at the lucerne the end of may to the start of june and loved it the room on the 12th floor was clean no smell of smoke the bathroom was recently updated and the bed comfortable 
the location in a more residential area with tons of great restaurants within a few blocks the subway stop a mere block away and the pleasant staff all made this a place well definitely stay at again if we ever make it back to nyc we paid 210nt booking through the hotels site and our room had a king size bed",5.0
not fancy but it gets the job done,we visited seattle for 6 days at the end of may 2008 a fancy hotel is not important to us but we do require a safe and clean place to stay the sixth avenue inn was just what we needed  it was fairly cheap compared to the other hotels  and its location was great which was about 6 blocks from the piers it was a little run down and the elevators and hallways sometimes smelled a little funny but the rooms were always clean and smelled fine if you want a luxury hotel this is not the place for you but it was perfect for travelers who want a comfortable place to come home to at night and a safe place to leave your things during the day,3.0
a new hotel with some kinks to work out,"this hotel is tragically hip i have stayed at ws before and havent felt this way so to me theres something about this one in particular it started with the completely black foyer with only an elevator and the far away door to the bar this is a very sparse and nonwelcoming way to be greeted then i went to the 5th floor to check in and walked into a lounge that was trying really hard to be a club unfortunately i couldnt hear a thing the woman at the desk was saying because of the pounding club music from the dj table a few steps away  so i had trouble hearing important things like your room number is my hotel room had no tv remote and while someone did bring it it was annoying that it was missing in the first place i ordered room service at one point but the dessert i wanted was no longer being offered the clock radio was set to 445am when i arrived at 930pm the lighting in my room was way too white  i had to play with the various switches to make it less industrial and more homey the lighting was a problem in the bathroom too because it shined right down on me creating shadows when i was trying to do my makeup i had to use the scary magnifying mirror so i did my makeup hunched over the sink to see into the little magnifying mirror 
also i find it rather forced to be called by my first name by hotel staff who wants this i would think young people who would like it couldnt afford the w and older people would appreciate a little less familiarity im not an old lady  im 37  and i wonder how middleaged guests view this familiarity 
the wifi is rather pricey at 1495 per device per day and the signal wasnt the strongest either i only used one device my ipod and was charged for two so i was unable to use the automatic check out on the tv as i had to go discuss the charge with the front desk at least during check out there was no dj blasting music so we could actually hear each other 
finally the w offers a free ride to certain parts of the city as an acura promotion but when i tried to use it it was totally booked seems like there may only be one or two cars so book immediately upon your arrival if you want to use it 
on the plus side i really liked the shower products and the bed as always was very comfortable the room service dinner was quite tasty so i appreciated that and the bathroom was fantastically clean  not a single stray hair from a prior guest in all i think there are a lot of kinks to work out here i still like starwood hotels but might not choose this particular one again anytime soon",3.0
nice and new hotel easy to navigate city,we stayed for 5 nights in sept 2010 like others have said it was easy to get to from the airport via the light rail 250 also all buses in downtown area are free we were able to walk to several restaurants pikes market the water etc we walked to the downtown shopping area as well but it was a bit more of a hike the area felt very safe during the day but it was pretty empty at night seems like more of a worker area the room was nice although small the bistro was great for a snack or drink the service was great in all a nice stay,5.0
great place with good elvis ambiance,"this place was pretty nice the outside was slightly worn down but the rooms are newly renovated it is literally across the street from graceland and there are elvis stores all around right up the street about 12 mile is a supermarket liquor store fast food type mall area to pick up anything you need the neighborhood is not the best but that is simply the neighborhood that graceland is in nowadays 
the hotel has the fancy guitar shaped pool free elvis movies all day and night and a pretty cool lobby area with pictures of elvis and gold records etc 
the breakfast was a little above average for a free one decent selection of foods pets allowed for only 10day great staff too 
highly recommended to get into the elvis mood if you are going to visit graceland if you are just looking to stay somewhere in memphis you probably should look elsewhere graceland and this hotel is several miles from beale street and other downtown attractions overall this place was a great value and a good time",4.0
a service oriented gem on pacific beach,"in an age where my low expectations of service are often consistently met  i must share the enjoyable experience i had in dealing with the staff at the pacific terrace our midnight checkin was greeted with pleasant front desk staff that got us situated quickly thank you kyla professional concierge staff provided us with information on local attractions and dining the housekeeping staff observed we had our kids with us and made wonderful origami towel animals that delighted our 8 and 3 yr old when we returned to the room after playing at the beach gabriela didnt hesitate and patiently took time from her duties when asked if she could show my daughter how to make them 
every encounter i had with the staff at this hotel made us feel like welcome guests  we look forward to more stays at the pacific terrace",5.0
can get a much nicer deal for the money dont recommend,i was intrigued by all the positive reviews i read about this hotel but when my friend and i arrived we were very disappointed first of all for 170 a night for 2 people accommodations and even location should have been much better our room had an awful smell when we came in it smelled like burnt rubber we tried to change to another room on a different floor but there was the same smell there too it was so bad that people next door to us were sitting with their door open to air out the room because their room had the same smell then my friend went to take a shower and literally got stuck because the shower door was completely broken i had to rescue her the door was never fixed and we just kept it open out of frustration we checked out the very following day and went to a motel that wasnt too far away but was cheaper much nicer and also had the free parking last but not least in a hurry to get out of there i forgot my phone charger in the room and when i called an hour or so later they said they never found anything i dont really believe they even looked for it which is very sad basically i vote a no on this hotel,2.0
a unique hotel haunted so they stay very comfortable rooms with an exceptional staff,historical hotel which gives a unique experience the hotel is very well kept and the staff is great be alert to the fact this is a very busy hotel with lots of weddings and social gatherings so the common spaces can be loud but never heard anything in the rooms which are well insulated all of the amenities were very nice did i mention that the staff was great,5.0
perfect place to celebrate an anniversary,my husband and i celebrated our anniversary with 9 nights at ink48 in november we were really pleased with the hotel and its amenities as in touch members we received a room upgrade and all of the other perks of membership like free wifi and a mini bar credit the room was large clean and very comfortable with a fantastic view the hotel even provided aveda bath salts for the huge tub the staff was friendly and cheerful in honor of our anniversary the hotel had a bottle of bubbly and a gift box of delicious treats waiting in our room we loved the coffeetea set up in the morning and the ice water that was available all day although we did not participate every evening the wine reception each day was a great option before heading out to dinner and a show we love to walk so the location was not an issue for us but it is a good three blocks to the nearest metro station and farther for some lines dinner at their restaurant print was excellent we also really enjoyed stecchino wine bar on 9th pj clarkes across from lincoln center  try the lobster blt caffee ciello on 8th and picking up some take out from the amish market on 9th sunday morning we took a walk along the river and then came back through chelsea where we had a great breakfast at le grainne another favorite for us is crepes on columbus followed by walking the full length of central park we met many fine local people who were all eager for us to enjoy their city it was a memorable trip,5.0
not worth the money avoid if you can,"while i got a decent deal from priceline decent by ny standards for this hotel usd 300 a night while the hotels quote was 400500 usd it still wasnt worth the money it would not have been much different staying in a 3 star for less 
first of all the hotel is derelict and badly in need of refurbishment the room was like a shoebox with the door giving directly onto the room  which increases your exposure to the corridor noise and the bathroom small the window was small and there was no minibar  very surprising for a hotel like this one worst of all the room was dirty see attached photos 
in addition they charge you 2 per piece of luggage you want to leave with them after checking out why that i have never seen that before this should clearly be included in the price like in any normal and decent hotel 
the location is one of the few strengths of the hotel  but then there are many others in good locations too the service was ok  no major problems on that front and thats obviously important 
but do go elsewhere if you can unless you get a great deal for the hotel which may be possible depending on the season",2.0
great place to stay in dc,we really liked the hotel lombardy its an old building with lots of character and charm the elevators are small and slow but thats the only minus the hotel is located a few blocks away from the mall and crowds but only two blocks away from a metro stop from which you can go anywhere the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms are enormous and clean ours was on the 9th floor and was very quiet for the price you wont do better in dc,4.0
amazing rooms staff food location need i go on,i echo a lot of the reviews already here the staff were friendly and professional without being in your face nothing was too much trouble complimentary drinks and snacks in the room and the lobby including complimentary wine at 6pm every night amazing breakfast definitely worth the b and b option large modern and sleek room with everything i could have wanted no bath but what the hell the shower was ace anyway even the toiletries were gorgeous one minor thing to mention we had read that the bar was a really good place to go but it wasnt that happening when we went however we had some good cocktails there go stay,5.0
good value in great location,this hotel is 3 blocks west of the white house adjacent to the campus of george washington univ it is a converted apartment building so our room had a full kitchen and eating area which was very nice it is an older building and has been renovated with a minimalist feel but i thought for the area it was a good deal good free internet there was only 1 elevator that was slow like all dc hotels parking was expensive,4.0
nyc family trip,hotel was great for the price good location quite rooms breakfast was fine better than expected gym only real down side was slow elevator and inability to adjust heat would stay here again but would try their times square hotel if available,4.0
do not stay here,"awful place we would not stay the night  terrible odors room was dirty  bathroom was worse and even had a dirty towel still hanging on the bathroom door when we went to leave after being in the room for less than 5 minutes the front desk person shouted at us and the other families several who all wanted to check out he accused us of dirtying the towel and refused to refund our money we have filed complaints with the corporate office
we stay at many abv inns across the country and have never experienced anything as bad as this",1.0
nice stay but wheres the sunlight,"we decided to stay locally for my birthday so we decided on the us grant we are spg platinum members and got upgraded to a suite so it was definitely a nice plus 
the suite was somewhat cozy so i wonder how a regular room may look like also we were afraid to pull up our window shades because our outside view was straight into someone elses room or bathroom 
overall the room was lovely and we got a good rate for it but i think i would prefer to stay outside of downtown san diego for a more spacious room with sunlight if i had to stay in downtown for a convention i would probably shop around because theres plenty of other hotels with good ratings to try",4.0
not your usual hyatt,far away from all memphis attractions poor service ok rooms good price,2.0
great airport accomodations,"just got back from a three night stay at this hotel the room was spacious quiet and easily accessible the staff is great should be able to book for about 100 a nite this does not include parking which is an additional 17 per day
beware of the free airport shuttle its not a problem leaving the hotel to get back to the airport if you try and catch it when you first arrive they sometimes get crowded and will pass you i arrived at the united airlines arrival area and two shuttles to the hotel passed me because they were full ended up catching a cab evidently united is at the end of the run",5.0
one year on and still excellent,"i wrote a review of this hotel having stayed here last year and having now just returned from my second stay here i thought i would provide an updated review
having enjoyed my stay here last year when booking this years trip i dealt with the hotel directly to make the booking the 7 nights stay was booked very quickly and i was given the choice to pay at the time of booking or at check in this gave me the opportunity to keep an eye on the exchange rates secure the best rate i could when paying
we arrived at the hotel and through the front door it was good to be back we were immediately welcomed to the hotel there were a few guests in front of us so we had a little wait but nothing too long our suitcases were taken to the side for us whilst we waited whilst waiting it was evident that the professionalism and level of service had not changed as the guests before us were being dealt with quickly by the very helpful front desk staff
i am happy to report that the hotel is still as excellent as it was a year ago when our turn to check in arrived we were welcomed back this being our second stay at the hotel the staff member checking us in was very polite and processed us quickly asking if we needed anything like a map of the city etc and was quite surprised when i said i still had a map from a trip some 3 years ago 
with door key in had we were ready to head to the room heading to the lift we were asked if we needed assistance with our luggage but having only small cases we were happy to take these ourselves into the lift and heading to our room
this year we were staying on 24th floor in a city view room the room was the same size as our room last year which was on the 16th floor this time we had a view of the hudson from our window i really like the rooms at this hotel they are a decent size and very comfortable with excellent amenities the addition of the coffeetea machines in the room is a plus though i still prefer the fresh coffee in the lobby each morning
the staff here are still very professional and always seem happy and nothing is too much trouble whether that be asking for directions or making a reservation at a restaurant the staff always have a smile and a welcome back  enjoy your day as you pass through reception 
the staff seem to be very proud to be a part of what makes the distrikt hotel such a special place and welcome comments about what is good  bad about a guests experience this can be seen when a guest last year commented about not having coffee  tea facilities in the rooms and within a day or two every room had a machine
overall i have had yet another excellent stay at the distrikt and cannot recommend this hotel enough i do not usually make return visits to hotels but having had two excellent stays here this is a hotel that i will not hesitate to return to so much so that i am already planning next years trip
if youre looking for a decent hotel in manhattan that offers a bespoke service has excellent rooms excellent staff and a great location then this is it 
the hotel is still highly ranked here on trip advisor and that has to say something about the quality of this hotel 
this is a great hotel which gives a level of service and experience that in my opinion you just dont find in a lot of hotels especially ones part of big chains
if your thinking about staying here do it in my opinion you wont be disappointed",5.0
beautiful hotel near the space needle,"we loved the slightly quirky design of the maxwell and stayed in one of their level5 duet queen hill rooms service was friendly hotel and room were clean and well maintained free parking which can get full free wifi
walking distance to several restaurants we liked the bamboo garden chinese vegetarian restaurant just 1 block away on roy st we also tried the banh thai restaurant which was ok
decent sized fitness room which overlooked the indoor swimming pool
our wishlist  suggestions for improvements
1 selfservice laundry facilities would have been a bonus
2 our room was located as far as you could get from the elevators and it was quite a walk would be nice to have a second set of elevators
3 we would have wished for a little more manouver room in the basement garage but free parking is always appreciated we were driving a minivan
4 boost the wifi connection speeds",5.0
very nice would definitely stay again,my handicapped brother and i stayed here aug 1115 for elvis week it was a very nice property  very clean and new the room was amazing  very spacious and had everything we needed it had two queen beds that were extremely comfortable as well as a large pull out sofa and kitchenette we requested a handicap room and the bathroom was wonderful it was very large with a rollin shower the pool was clean as well as the area surrounding the pool everything was well maintained at this property the free breakfast was delicious with lots to choose from including a fantastic waffle maker you could eat indoors or outside they were in the process of setting up a nice little bar area in the lobby while i was there they have two computers in the lobby that you can use for free elevators were spacious and fast the staff were outstanding im sorry i didnt get the name of the lady who was extremely helpful in getting our handicap room keys so i could mention her here there was a gentleman named kevin who was also very nice and helpful the shorter of the 2 kevins the best part was the location you walk out the door and right onto the 100 trolley downtown to beale st or you could walk 10 mins  i timed it twice it was on a very lovely tree lined street with a park across the street as well as a walgreens and great restaurants sams on the corner had a wonderful chicken breast sandwich  fries for 650 another restaurant on the next corner called the flight i think was also very nice  a little more elegant and a little more pricey but very good food  1126 for chicken or steak dinner depending on the size you order beale st had a great bar called wet willies i highly recommend this property,5.0
average stay at central hotel,"we stayed at this central hotel was very average but close enough to centre service was fairly decent but just found some basics were missing for a hotel that should be 4 star easy to take the streetcar to the wharf and to take no30 to chinatown it was nice trip whether was hot in early november we couldnt wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel 
expensive to eat in hotel we went out to chinatown 
restaurants are average in sf airport  watch out for the shuttle bus do not be conned to take one even if they appear to be in a nice shirt and tie the drivers are dodgy be aware it cost 35 when it shoud have been 32 better to take a taxi it is actually cheaper 32 finally when you book online via travelocity you get a good deal and also get tonnes of spam just be sure you use an email you dont care about travelocity naughty naughty you spammed me and sold my email to make money did you not tut tut will not book through you next time for that so i hope you learn next time overall i would say this is an average hotel probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand i am extremely fussy perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is walk around abit",3.0
stay somewhere closer,the hotel itself is in a historic building with art deco design however the furniturebedmattresscarpet dont appear to have been updated or changed since the thing was built the room was mostly clean however it gives off a dirty appearance when the furniture is all cracked scuffed and broken walls were dirty with some handprints and the carpet was worn and had several dark stains in one area of the room the mattress was terrible  felt like it could bend underneath you and fold you up the heater was terribly noisy one of the nights we were there and the walls are extremely thin so that we could hear whoever was in the hallway the room next to us the room above and the room below the positive part about the hotel is that the staff were very friendly and nice if we had a question they were happy to answer and they offered to call a car service upon our departure this hotel does not offer free internet which was hugely disappointing but not surprising considering everything in the hotel was from about 87 years ago it is advertised as midtown east on pricelines website but this was at the very furthest end of that far from most attractions we would not stay here again based on the room and location we would gladly have paid a little more for a better room and location,2.0
nice room great location,found this location on line hotel was great people were great also,5.0
great friendly service,i stayed at le meridien for an outside meeting it was an easy walk to the ferry building i loved the rooms the extended hour concierges were extremely helpfuli had gone to st regis too much attitude to check it out for a drink and i greatly prefer the service at the bar at le meridien the service at the le meridien bar was great professional yet friendlyi realy enjoyed the view from my room of the bay bridge my only comment is that the cd player in my room was glued to the counter and too high for me to read the dials  i will stay there again with my i pod,5.0
go elsewhere,we stayed for two nights in september and after having stayed at le meridien in chicago this was a major disappointment no one was at the door when i arrived which meant shlepping my large suitcase up the stairs there is no handicapped sloped platform which would have made life easier the lobby while rather grand in spots has all the charm of a convention center the front desk folks were busy but did their job efficiently but what greets you upstairs really scares you  hallways that are narrow dingily lit and rather institutional we were upgraded to a larger room but the bathroom was no bigger than a closet and if there was no one at the front entrance when i arrived there were two doormen and one other guy didnt know what his role was standing around chatting while i dragged my bag to the car this place needs a major makeover and a change of staff go elsewhere,2.0
hawthorne was great,my visit to the hawthorne was pleasurable compared to recent reviewers comments it was not the nicest hotel room but i found it clean and responsive to any of my needs such as a refrigerator n my room i didnt have a suite internet was free and the breakfast was one of the better ones for a hotel eggs bacon refried beans potatoes cereal fruit yogurt etc and it was good there was a happy hour in the evening they also have shuttle service i did not see any bugs of any kind i would return to this hotel,3.0
excellent location and service,after arriving in ny at midnight exhausted and in the middle of a heatwave the staff at wellington hotel were fabulous we had someone help us straight up to our to room which already had the air con for us the hotel is perfectly situated inbetween central park  times square both only short walks  straight across from the famous carnegie deli all the staff were extremely polite  helpful in every way the rooms were on the smaller side but in a city like ny i doubt u go there to hang out in ur hotel room so it was just perfect,5.0
nice location and clean but old and shady,"at hotel carter you get a cheap room in a great location half a block away from times square so there are concessions to be made the entrance and lobby of the hotel looks like they are in the middle of a renovation except that nobody is working to actually renovate the elevators make weird noises and should probably be displayed in a museum everything needs a new coat of paint
our room was small but clean it had a large closet which lacked a light and had a single coat hanger the bathroom was large and clean and the shower was very good
the interactions with the hotel staff were good and they were quick to provide us with additional pillows",3.0
just as expected for hilton super cute for the price  distance from city,this airport hilton used to be a military control tower converted into a cute eclectic hilton round funky building with a huge rotunda restaurant everything you expect when you walk into a hilton of course knowing you are at the airport and plane traffic i didnt have a problem with any noise updated furnishings with mild texas twist not country or anything too crazy but ill call it southern touch city was close with a car and this hilton was half the price as the one downtown i enjoyed my stay and my meal,5.0
best view service and so much fun,we stayed here for our 14 year anniversary and my birthday and wow what a great time we had the staff was super friendly and a little tip check out their social media it will be worth your while one of the best parts our room was on the 9th floor facing the rivermichigan ave during the day you could see the wonderful city and at night there was the beautiful wrigley buidling everything about our trip was wonderful and you could not be in a better location than this the views from everywhere are wonderful and have a drink in the big bar that is a great one right in your hotel oh i almost forgot do not forget your workout clothes their fitness center is a dream come true and you need that in a city with such wonderful cuisine,5.0
the unexpected gem with unbelievable service,i found symphony inn due to good reports from other people on tripadvisor it was in a price range that was unbelievably low so i was a little skeptical though the reviews were solid i booked five nights on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the bed its better than the one i have at home and mine is a very high quality mattress the room was spotlessly clean and the bath area had been recently remodeled with very high quality tile and a pattern even it was a suitesized space with a love seat king bed fridge microwave cd player and dvd player now for the fun of the place when i turned the lights off at night stars glowed on the walls and the ceilings there was a blacklight and some really neat murals on the walls when i came the first time i had asked for bedside lights to read by since the room didnt have any i also could not get wireless plus had a broken bathplug when i came to my room later the same day as mentioning it to the manager the tub was fixed i had a hardwire cord in my room for internet and two bedside lamps i was so impressed any property can have issues but its how quick they are addressed that makes such a difference this was whiplash fast now for the really good part i came back two weeks later for an overnight trip when i arrived to check in the same nice manager had the same room reserved for me he greeted me warmly and said he had the room i liked the lamps and the internet ready for me i was so touched to see what a great memory he had and how helpful he was you know its really great to have people care about what they do and to do it the best they can i travel a lot for business and i must say that i really feel welcome here like my business matters you dont get that much these days especially for a such a great value,5.0
please dont tell anyone about this hotel,"we stayed here in a 1 br suite with two adults and three small children this was a phenomenal deal the room was very spacious and well decorated the beds were comfortable and the kitchenette was great for small meals eg bagels for breakfast the staff was also very helpful and my daughters loved the little tea room in the lobby
i also like that it is in a real nyc neighborhood  not midtown or god forbid times square if you want to be a hardcore tourist this may not be the hotel for you",5.0
horrible and smelly,"the minute i walked into the lobby i encountered a foul smell the second floor had a different but almost equally foul smell the room itself smelled of chemicals which was an improvement over the other areas of the hotel the rooms are old the mattress was old and had only a thin worn sheet on it no mattress pad the toilet made a very loud noise when flushing im sure the people next door hated it just as much the deadbolt lock would stick and made it difficult to get the door open if you used it basically i felt like i didnt want to touch anything i asked for an extra sheet so that i could have two sheets underneath me because no matress pad and one on top and not have to touch the blankets the only positive things about this place which dont balance out the negatives are the location central to s congress shops and restaurants barton springs downtown and the friendly staff the facility itself stinks literally the outside is very misleading it looks fairly new but the inside is gross 
this is the first time ive felt compelled to write a review on a hotel it was that bad",1.0
not as good as it should have been but ok,"we are hhonors gold members we favor homewood and embassys for the room when we travel with family this was our big trip of the summer the 2nd half was at this homewood the location is ok we needed to be in between san diego and carlsbad so it worked for that it wasnt real convenient to san diego there is nothing near by except a hilton garden inn the spa and restaurant they described on the homewood website is really next door 
the room and hotel were an average hs what we werent excited about several things 1st time ever a homewood charged us to upgrade to a room with two beds we had three people we were there on rewards and at this hotel that isnt good enough for two beds ive stayed at many many hss and never had this happen parking is extremely limited come home early no wifi in the rooms only one wired connection we run ecommerce businesses and we travel with two to three laptops phones that would benefit from wifi and other stuff ridiculous in this day and age that you have to go to the lobby for a wifi connection the breakfast closed early at 2 out of the 3 days we tried to make it the 3rd had very little selection available and wasnt quickly replenished 3 breakfast burritos and the family in front took all of those the evening reception we never saw open im sure it must have been but again not for the posted hours 
again we love hs but this one did not do it for us",3.0
friendly service huge room good location,the st giles was conveniently located within walking distance to grand central station and madison square garden our room on the second floor was large clean and comfortable the bed was great with nice linens and pillows the temperature in the room was hard to regulate but it kept us very warm the shower head didnt have a lot of pressure but these were minor complaints compared to all the positives,4.0
standard hampton good location,"the hotel itself is your standard hampton inn which is why i stay at hamptonsyou know what to expect the location was literally right next to the convention center and a short walk from old city the room was nice and our bathroom was large when i first saw the breakfast room around 715 am for a cup of tea i was pleasantly surprised at how large it was then i went back a little after 9 for breakfast and was so packed we couldnt walk eat early or dont bother
i had trouble sleeping because the ac unit was pretty loud and obviously kept kicking on but it will only bother you if you are a light sleeper my husband slept fine anbd wasnt bothered by it at all
the parking lot is just past the main entrance on the right side it is 25 to self park and they take credit cards i think it is called patriot parking they tell you where to park and you keep your key it is not covered
the only snag we hit was asking the front desk staff for help with directions two different people couldnt help us and one said they didnt have a metro we just used the map app on our phones and figured it out fortunately we happened to be asking during the free cookie hour so it made up for it",4.0
the mariott can handle a crowd,we stayed here for one night and we were quite pleased  the hotel was booked solid but its such a big hotel it never felt crowded we received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a better view on the 32nd floor and it was very quiet and spacious had a light lunch at the katen sushi bar and it was reasonable we had 530 reservations at the view restaurant but decided to eat in the view lounge instead 2795 pp for the buffet the deserts were good but the dinner items were just ok and of course the view of ny was fantastic my daughter was hungry at the end of the evening and ordered room service although i was hesitant to pay 10 for the double hotdog item listed it did come with a hefty order of steak fries and arrived within 30 minutes service throughout the hotel was great elevators were not a problem the longest wait was 1012 minutes when we left the view lounge to go to an 8 pm show and again when we came in from the show around 11pm only complaint is we wanted to make a quick bathroom stop as we left for the show and decided to use the bathrooms on the 3rd floor where the marquis is on our way out the line was so long and we were surprised that there were not more bathrooms check out was super quick all in all we would stay here again great location,4.0
beautiful hotel  i couldnt believe it was a holiday inn,"i just stayed here this weekend and the hotel wasnt like any holiday inn i have seen before the front desk associate told me it was a new design of holiday inn everything was new and clean it is very close to the airport and there is a sports bar attached it reminded me more of a marriott then a holiday inn 
there is also a holiday inn express in the rear of the hotel which is seperate from this holiday inn",5.0
wonderful customer service,we stayed over night before our cruise on september 10 the employees from the front desk to the shuttle drivers were all very friendly willing to answer any of our questions with a smile the hotel is not in a great area but i never felt unsafe the rooms were spacious and clean we appreciated the free shuttle service to the inner harbor and pick up after also the free shuttle service back and forth from the cruise port the free breakfast in the morning was plenty and good the great thing about this hotel is they have a cruise package if you are going on a cruise you can leave your car there for no extra charge i would absolutely recommend this hotel and i would stay here again thanks to a staff for a job well done,4.0

my new favorite place,"my hubby and i travel to chicago annually and stayed here at the recommendation of our friends for the first time this past weekend 
we took an early flight and were allowed to pre check in 8 am and our room was ready by noon they upgraded us to a corner suite which over looked the chicago river the bed and linens were wonderful 
i have no complaints about the hotel employees and felt like they really tried to make our stay as enjoyable as possible i have only two things that i didnt like
lighting in the room was horrible especially the bathroom they do have a make up mirror but the room was soo dark this could easily be fixed and im over it 
two drinks at the bar in the lobby bacardi coke and a grey goose gimlet were 2700 i understand we are in chicago but it just seemed excessive the bartender was very nice and the bar was welcoming other than that i have nothing at all to say that isnt 100 positive
it may be worth noting that ive stayed in the four seasons hotel palomar and hotel sax while visiting chicago i would say the westin is my new favorite along with palomar 
well be back ",5.0

outstanding hotel and staff,the management team was very receptive to my needs and questions management treated me like a family member in their home management ensured that my stay was the ultimate hotel experience they provided me with a complimentary dinner at the hotel restaurant very delicious meal for my small inconveinience hotel has modern decor rooms are plush and quiet with a great work out room i will most definately stay and eat here again on my next visit to san jose hotel is centrally located in the downtown area close to shops and restaurants they gained a repeat customer,5.0
harbor court very nice and relaxed,my girlfriend and i stayed at the harbor court on the weekend of december 2628 for two nights with both of us being kimpton in touch members we received an email from kimpton with a pretty good promotion so we booked the room and then after reading tripadvisor contacted the manager jason stone via email and hw was generous enough to offer us a complimentary room upgrade to a king unfortunately jason wasnt available to personally thank while we stayed at the hotel dulce and john at the front were very helpful and friendly the wine hour is a great kimpton staple and i really enjoyed the living room area of the harbor court it was pretty quiet and relaxing even though many guests were enjoying the wine hour definitely a difference with the other kimpton hotels union square hotels that seem to have too much traffic had dinner accross the street at sinbads and also a couple doors down at mexico df both highly recommended satuday was able to go to the farmers marker right accross the street which was fun also the f line streetcar runs very near the hotel so you can take that to get to fishermans wharf or union square in no time,4.0

great location but very small rooms,"we went to this hotel in a group of 22 we had to wait 20 mins to get the keys to go up because they werent ready for us then we all go in to go to the 11 12 or 14th floors but waited 20 mins because the hotel staff was using both elevators instead of them using only one we then walked into the smallest room ever 
on the 2nd day of the 4 days the ac stopped working i called and she said it was the battery in the wall unit and it would be fixed we came back about 2 that afternoon and i called down and told them it is displaying numbers but the unit will nit work we left and came back about 8 it wasnt working i called down and the woman at the desk said that there was no one to fix it so i just waited on the phone and she didnt suggest anything to do so i asked her well what are you going to do for me she said that she would call me back 30 mins later when i didnt hear from her i called back down and she tried to ignore me so i let it ring about 30 times the mgr gets on the phone i asked for at least a fan she does bring it in about 10 mins i was hot all night the next morning i went down and asked the lady at the desk i wanted to make sure my room was on a list to get the ac fixed it wasnt so i added it it was fixed by the time we got back hours later
we also had to get our own wash clothes because i guess u need towels and hand towels but no wash clothes they didnt pick up the garbage from the floor area but 1 day of the 4 there were hairs in the tub on the towels and in the sink 
the good thing about this hotel is the location it was located near michigan avenue a lot of shopping and dinning",2.0
not what i was expecting,"prosthe hotel had many little things that just made me smile because they were an effort to show they wanted to please their customers laundry basket scale free treats in a basket in room pilllow menu cd player on alarm clock dvd player with dvd selections in lobby books to borrow in lobby as well little store in lobby free dessert and coffee in the lobby evening the hotel was clean which is the only thing i care about when hotel shopping the desk staff was courteous and knew the area well to direct help me downtown with a map and directions bed was comfy and room had basic amenities quiet location breakfast although not gourmet had hot options and offered a nice little selection 
consthe location is not really near anything but is within 5 miles of the downtown area im really trying here as i am usually quite picky but on this stay we did not have any negative experiences 
overall this is not what you would expect or receive from your average 2 star hotel i think they have the amenities at this location probably put them in the 3 star range although super 8 arent traditionally 3 star hotels i read the reviews so we were not too surprised about what they offered so it lived up to the ratings for the price this location was a winner",5.0
the best,this is by far the best hampton inn that weve stayed at the quality of this hotel is superior from the lobby on up to the rooms themselves it was so nice that we extended our stay an extra night  the beds are fantastic nice breakfast assortment lots of parking and its only a few minutes to everything around san diego there are a few restaurants down the road from panda express to subway check in and out was easy quick and professional  hotel was extremely clean only minor flaw was that there is some sort of convention center behind the hotel and they were having a loud concert of some sort for a while  other than that its an absolutely fantastic place,5.0
customer service so terrible i never even got to book a room,"called the new w boston to book a wow suite for a specail anniversary
got the run around from reservation clerk who tranferred me to someone else that person told me to hang on as the phone is ringing off the hook i waited for about 5 minutes when he returned he told me he couldnt reserve a wow suite without going to corporate sales on hold again he came back and said could he call me back unbelievable he never called me back this am i called and spoke to the w boston hotel reservations manager and he barely appologized that is it for the w what horrid service i have booked at the four seasons instead",1.0
everything extra,front desk is nice the room decor is outdated wifi should be free they want to charge for everything,4.0
location location,this is probably the most convenient of the various phl airport hotels other than staying at the marriott at the airport next time though i think thats where ill stay ive stayed at this embassy suites four times in the past few years simply because its convenient but this place has proven consistently to be a dump a few highlights from this stay my room had a dirty overflowed toilet didnt the housekeeper even look at it water glasses which didnt appear clean the pillows had the pillowcases in tight knots never seen anything like thisit was like the housekeeper was being either malicious or bored the rock music on the intercom played loud until sometime after 11pm the lazy person at checkin gave me incorrect instructions on signing into the internet so i had to call down to get it right etc i am so done with this mediocre place,2.0
update  revisiting this hotel,"based on my previous experience i returned for a nine day stay over the christmas 2007 holiday
again found the hotel clean staff helpful room service good accomodations pleasant and location good for beverly hills  westwood  century city
the update is this first they are building some big apartment building across the street the pile drivers and saws started earlyat least up until the day before christmas be aware that this construction looks to be going on for some time to comethough the noise from it will likely deminish as time goes on however we found it difficult to stay asleep much beyond 730 am on the days they were working especially true if you open the windows to let in fresh air
second hotel rehabbing is ongoing the main lobby area has been closed off one of the elevators wasnt working clearly some rooms were in the process of being redone they said they were looking at a copule of months workthen they would be raising their rates to about 375 per room per night above the very reasonable for location and siize i paid still the accomodations were a better bargain than some other suite hotels in the areabut the potential price increase will move it out of the good deal catagory
third when we were there in october our room had a regular matress that was one of the more comfortable hotel beds my wife and i ever slpet in this time we had one of those temperpedic sp matressesie foam that seems to mold around your body far less happy with thatthough i am sure some like it it felt like we were sleeping on sand and also made the bed hot imo much perferred the oldstyle matress this would cause us to reconsider staying there again as we never felt we got a great night sleep
fourth the water pressure in our room was problematic there were problems when we mentioned it to the desk they seemed to hop to and get it fixed but it seems like more problems with water pressure were looming given the hotel rehabbing
overall we continue to like this hotel having a full kitchen available as well as living room and eatin dinning room for the price we paid in beverly hillswestwood was terrific we gave it a higher rating the first time we stayed it is still a good hotel but price and conditions may reduce its desirability affordability and many of its good points",2.0
comfortable and cozy,i was pleasantly surprised upon my arrival to find a wellappointed and spacious suite for such a modest cost the entire property was wellmaintained staff was very cordial and services were prompt i could not have asked for more i look forward to returning on my next visit to the san antonio area,5.0
nice rooms fair price,"stayed here for 3 nights on business hotel is in the process of becoming a hyatt plaza property breakfast was included and very good dinning was limited due to construction staff was friendly and helpful 
king size bed was comfortable 42 plasma tv and free internet worked fine",4.0
great hotel,great hotel and great location middle of the city not far from union square the hotel also offers transportation to the city and the pier nice rooms and bathroom very comfortable beds the staff is very friendly and accommodating go above and beyond to meet your needs the best part is there is complementary breakfast with a nice view on the roof top would definitely recommend the cova hotel,5.0
windy city mustsees just steps away,i love chicago its a helluva town whenever im in town for business that requires me to stay downtown i stay at the embassy suites hotel chicago downtown the property itself is beautiful the atrium is aweinspiring and the rooms are wonderfully appointed the managers reception is always a great networking opportunity though get there early if you want a free drink free breakfast great atmosphere lots of meeting space  perfect location too,4.0
clean and comfortable but bizarre location and facia,it may be philadelphia but this hotel was in a non descript street does not look much from the outside and blink as you drive past and you would miss it the rooms were well appointed and comfortable though ac was a bit ropey staff and atmosphere non existent all in all stay here if you want ok room and have were with all to find your own way about the city very impersonal,3.0
great stay,this hotel was a great find it is conveniently located next to a number of resturants and donut shops it is both clean and inviting and the staff is extremely good at what they do the front desk help was kind and considerate towards our children and made them feel like they were at a home away from home the breakfast offered is not just donuts and juice but a mix of hot and cold items including biscuits and gravy eggs cereal waffles etc the best part about breakfast is the host most hotels that offer food have a staff that keeps the food stocked but this hotel has an actual host that cares enough to ask how your stay is going sings songs and genuinely enjoys brightening your day the rooms are spacious and the beds are plush the best stay we have had in a very long time,5.0
the perfect stay,"traveling for business and must say that i thoroughly enjoyed the stay
lynn and antonio at the front desk were welcoming and knowledgeable the housekeeping staff very kind and helpful the shower worked by pulling down on the faucet in the tub and that was new to me
our business meeting was in the hotel and facilities were excellent
continental breakfast tasty and fruit very fresh and plentiful
walking distance to some great restaurants 
all in all a perfect business trip",5.0
potential if they address maintenance and cleanliness,this hotel has potential but is far from there i would not go back until a major overahaul is done i travel a lot on business so a clean hotel that is well maintained is a must i do not need a four star hotel just a reliable hotel the bathroom shower had peeling paint there were stains on the carpet and on a blanket,2.0
favorite place to stay in boston,"quiet even though it is at a busy intersection 
comfortable clean pleasant staff continental 
breakfast close to many resturants and historical
spots just great all around",5.0
very nice place to stay  great staff  great location,we had our wedding ceremony  reception here at the sofitel and a lot of our guests also stayed here for the weekend the overall consensus was that the staff were extremely accommodating genuinely friendly and super attentive the rooms are great but mainly its the great service that you get here would also recommend based on its convenient location  just a few blocks from the magnificent mile,4.0
great deals available for good quality hotel downtown,"we booked on the hotels website which offers great deals particularly if booked in advance
we had a room with 2 queen beds 2 breakfasts valet parking and a gift certificate for 50 in the galleria mall all for 159 feb 07 amazing value 
not too much to say really good checkin good quality coffee and coffee maker in room pool nice and breakfast very good as we were there for a saturday morning there was an omelette bar 
good facilities for printing out your boarding pass in the business suite next to the breakfast room",4.0
great place for the whole family,very nice place to stay the water park is great if you have kids worth the money lots of places to eat near by,4.0
what a great hotel,dont understand the complaints on this website about this hotel we stayed here for two nights in late august and loved everything about it first the location was great it was within walking distance of both the waterfront and pike place market and we could easily take the monorail to the space needle there are hills in seattle so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated and the staff was very helpful being on pioneer square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink andor something to eat of course we didnt walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there but thats just common sense we were never bothered by anyone and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city if youre worried about street noise call the hotel directly and ask for an interior room we had an interior king and it was very quiet we plan to return to seattle and when we do well stay at the best western pioneer square hotel again,5.0
disappointing compared with last years stay,"i stayed here last year and had a great stay and susequently left an excellent rating however my stay in the king george this year was a big disappointment the room was smaller which in itself would not be an issue but housekeeping was terrible our room was only half serviced each day towels were rarely changed over the 5 night stay coffee was never topped up in the room and the musty smell in the room was very annoying the radiators made a loud rattle or humming sounds which we were told was because the heating is on an old steam system we didnt experience this problem in the rooms we stayed in the year before in addition to this there must have been a leak from the radiator as the carpet alongside the radiator was saturated and i can only assume most likely responsible for the musty smell in the room
the were a few things about the hotel that helped keep up the rating 
1 its location
2 the staff frontdesk and especially drew in the bar
the hotel as i stated in my previous review of the hotel is excellent only a block from bart shopping and other activities
the staff in the hotel were at all time friendly and polite however our best experience was in the hotel bar at night we spent a lot of time this year in the hotel bar and were entertained each night by drew the barman we met drew during our previous stay at the hotel in 2007 and at that time were impressed at his ability to relate to each person in the bar 
again this year he remembered us and couldnt have been anymore helpful and friendly
another great thing about the frontdesk staff was the facility in place to advise and arrange our daytime tours and taxis to the airport 
it is these staff in the hotel that made our experience more comfortable considering the unexpected drop in standard of the rooms compared to our previous stay there
another improvement in the hotels offering was the change to the breakfast menu a self service buffet replaced the original overpriced menu the variety on offer had increased making it more suited to our needs",3.0
bed bugs good price good location,"i have stayed at this place twice before with no problems i am actually quite disapoined that i was bitten so badly this time i wont be back
while i can understand that bed bugs can happen anywhere the staff was compleatly unhelpful  even when i showed them a bug i had actually caught and trapped in a cup not to mention the numerous bites all over my body 
i liked this place because it is one of the cheepest in sf and it comes with a microwave and a minifridge in all the rooms 
it is definatly not the cleanest place inside or out but it is not disgusting or anything i dont like the tile floor in all the rooms either its cold to walk on
the location might be scary for some people who are not used to big cities 
this was my first time having been bitten by bed bugs it was terrible maybe i am allergic or something i ended up going to the emergency room because the swelling from the bites was so intense it took about two weeks for the bites to fully disappear
someting interesting to note as well
my boyfriend slept in the same bed with me and did not recieve any bites i think this is interesting because i just read something similar in another review for this place
it seems as though bed bugs do prefer some people over others or maybe women over men",2.0
front desk is hopeless,i cannot comment on the quality of the hotel itself but in attempting to call my spouse there was hopeless the phone kept ringing off the hook and this was between 912 midnight local time there is no excuse for this sort of terrible staffing if the hotels phone service is any reflection of the rest of the facility then this would rank slightly above boot camp,1.0
not bad but great location,"i stayed here 3 nights in september while attending a conference at the convention center supposedly the taxi fare is 32 from the airport as adverstised on the cab window but none of my colleagues or i got that rate something about extra taxes due to the airport our fares all ranged from 3845 the bellman at the hilton were all very welcoming and friendly and the front desk was nice enough i checked in at noon well ahead of the 3pm check in time 
the room was clean and fairly uptodate the downside was that the bathroom was very tiny it was quite awkward getting in and out of the bathroom to close the door also the hangers for the closet had the tiny hooks so they couldnt be used on a normal clothes rod in order to help combat theft as a result of this you couldnt hang your clothes just anywhere the only place besides the closet was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door this became quite annoying very quickly when getting ready 
on my last night there it was after 10 pm at night and i heard the sink make a funny gurgling noise when i looked in there it was full of brownish black water i called the front desk and someone came up and had it fixed within half an hour i dont know if this was an ongoing problem as my neighbor had the same problem that night but the response was quick and was taken care of quickly 
the location of this hotel cant be beat we were two blocks away from the convention center and about 56 blocks from pikes street market i walked down there 3 times during my stay the walk down is all downhill and the walk back can be quite a challenge depending on which way you come back if you walk down university street which the hilton sits on it will take you straight to pier 57 where youll find many restaurants we ate at the crab pot one night where they have a crab boil and dump all the goods on the table for you to break open with a mallet coming back up the stairs and hill after a full dinner was a real challenge but fun nonetheless 
overall this was a decent stay at a decent hotel not the bestbut not the worst the location of the hilton and walking around the city made this a memorable visit",4.0
a great place to stay,booked the room from the net we were very surprised at how nice the hotel was it was easy to get on and off the freeway the service was excellent  the breakfast buffet in the morning was worth the stay as it was included in our room cost we will stay there again there was some remodeling being done it will only improve the hotel it is right on the lite rail service line ,5.0
nothing fancy,this is a good place for a night or a couple of nightseast access to freewayswill not be staying there again was not as close to where i was going the place is kind of dated older bathroom fixtures,3.0
belvedere better than expected,my 13 yr old daughter and i stayed at the belvedere over school vacation in april i booked it because the rates were good and the reviews seemed good i did tell my daughter that it was a budget hotel and not to expect much but we were both pleasantly surprised it was a great choice the location was perfect and we were able to get early check in they held our bags on our last day while we were out and about before our train back home,4.0
disgustingly filthy,"the only good thing about ths hotel is the location the lobby is inviting displaying a grandeur which reflects its name we were allocated room 411 which had fungus on the walls the showerroom was broken tiles and dilapidated the toilet once flushed wouldnt stop running and we had to call maintenance five minutes into the stay
the clothes wardrobe was a barebricked hole in the wall with a louvre door
when we complained to the duty manager he was most unhelpful and suggested we book out  so we did
object lesson  examine the rooms before you register with this group as its not what you see on the brochure

charming hotel with a great location,booked 2 rooms here for a family meet up in the city we came from san jose and travel to san francisco a lot but the rest of the family was travelling down from the eureka area the hotel palomar has a great location with everything you would possibly need just minutes away the rooms were a great size and very clean when we checked in the kids were greeted with their own kids backpack filled with goodies they were very excited us adults took advantage of the wine in the lounge which made for a nice relaxing little treat would definitely stay here again in the future,4.0
nice stay staff very friendly,i recently spent six days at the marriott city center in denver if you are visiting for a convention or to enjoy the downtown 16th street area this property is a good bet staff are very friendly and helpful they went out of their way to help and came away from their desk to make sure that each person in the lobby was assisted as quickly as possible the accommodations were very comfortable and clean i would recommend this hotel in fact the only complaint i had was that they charged for internet service,4.0
excellent experience at the holiday inn riverwalk,"although it is an older hotel and therefore does not have the larger bathtubs or fancy bathrooms of modern hotels we have been delighted with each stay at the holiday inn riverwalk 
we have held two workshops for educators at this hotel one in december of 2003 and the other in june of 2004 we were extremely pleased with the service food and facilities each time and we will be going back for another workshop in december of 2004
we have held workshops at 4 and 5 star hotels throughout the united states and this hotel is above and beyond many others when it comes to attentive management large meeting spaces separate dining rooms for the attendees beautiful setup and the abundance of fabulous food 
the management was excellent and worked well with us in considering our budgetary constraints everyone was thorough attentive friendly and totally professional they made sure that we had everything we needed and that it was done the way we needed it done we have held workshops at some 4 and 5 star hotels when we never saw or heard from the management
the food was wellprepared and beautifully presented the banquet staff was outstanding  and special thanks to james and lourdes who took excellent care of us  there were beautiful fresh floral arrangements on the buffet and individual tables and the menu was bountiful varied and delicious
our sleeping room was wonderful as well we greatly enjoyed the patios overlooking the riverwalk it was very nice to be at a part of the riverwalk that was quiet and beautiful yet just a short walk to the busier section with shops and restaurants
the filet mignon served at the windows had to be prime beef  you couldnt taste a better steak each time we have dined there weve had a seat at the windows enjoying a beautiful view as well as excellent food and watistaff
if youre going to san antonio we would recommend the holiday inn riverwalk
we couldnt ask for more",5.0
very nice hotel right at dfw get your luggage and check in,stayed over night here on a layover coming back from vacation grand hyaltt is beautiful great location within the airport i think its terminal b but if you are not in b the skylink is quick check in was friendly and a breeze the room is very up to date with granite counters and floors in bathroon nice shower toiletries we arrived after nine so stayed in the hotel and had some snacks in lounge which was very nice albiet expensive but what hotel luinge isnt bed is very comfortable beautiful gym and spa its a lovely hotel,4.0
fine business hotel in the heart of the financial district,the financial district does not have too many hotelsmost are uptown around union square this boutique hotel is situated near the embarcadero and the california  montgomery intersection the staff was quite friendly and check in was quick one staff member mentioned that they have a regular clientele which allows them to become familiar the rooms are a bit spartan if youre looking for luxury or fine appointments but they serve well the room also was quite quiet for where it was situated theres a starbucks downstairs plus several nearby restaurants so its easy to get started parking is in the embarcadero center across the street the wifi was easy to sign into free and fairly quick,4.0
brilliant place to stay,"we stayed here for 5 days at the end of june and we were very impressed the rooms are lovely very large particularly for nyc and modern we were on the 7th floor and heard no noise from the street the staff were all excellent extremely helpful the guy working on the door was great and so friendly cant remember his name sorry hotels location was perfect and the lounge came in very useful too
i often judge a hotels quality by whether or not i would revisit it we will definitely be going back here and i wouldnt hesitate to recommend to friends",5.0
good value for money,good location 3 blocks away from metro rooms are pretty spacious with a separate closet room nothing too fancy but all the things you need for a good night rest a very comfy bed clean room and good housekeeping service we stayed facing the courtyard which was nicely quiet,4.0
some things are off,the overall feel of the hotel is very nice it is a modern hotel and well located but there were some things that i was not pleased with first of all the room was not clean i found dried food on the wall paper hairs on the bathroom floor and the desk in the room when we first entered was not cleaned furthermore we used the 2 glasses in the room to drink some water and they were not changed for the 4 days we stayed there even after we left a sign on top of them requesting that they be taken away the most annoying for me though was that we were flying out at 630 in the morning and the restaurant would obviously not be open for breakfast therefore we spoke to the front desk in the early evening if we could have breakfast sent to our room as room service at 400 am they told us they would ask and let us know later in the evening at 10 pm upon asking them they informed us that yes we could have breakfast and to order it from now through room service we then called room service they told us no problem and to put what we wanted and the time on the paper hanging outside our door we did so and needless to say at 4 am no breakfast upon checking out we asked the front desk why we were not sent breakfast and they told us that since we booked with expedia and even though we paid for a room with breakfast they do not honour the expedia bookings as we were leaving early then we were told that we could have had room service if we had paid for it seperately i then told her that we had ordered room service but no one had brought us anything anyways i would not stay here again they definately need to upgrade their customer service,3.0
great hotel,"this hotel is great i would definitely recommend this one to anybody as soon as you get there someone opens the door for you and asks how your day has been and chats with you for a few minutes while the valet driver gets information for your vehicle they were very efficient the front desk clerks were fantastic fast check in and early check in as well the lady made conversation with my boyfriend and i and was very pleasant all of the staff had smiles on their faces we went to the room and it was sparkling with cleanliness the housekeeper also helped us find our room the only not so great thing was the bathroom although still very clean just a little small and odd small double doors to get into it and somewhat of a small space manageable however 
we had ordered a few things from room service and it was delivered promptly i wish they had more of an option for certain areas and prices were a little high but it was expected
location was perfect literally 1 minute away from the aquarium",4.0
great location service and facilities could use some work,"the good location close to everything i needed and wanted to do and to subway room layout was good for a nyc hotel i got the king room very small but design and layout was practical and appealing exception was no full length mirror except inside closet door the door did not open so that you could actually see yourself lost opportunity on not making the overthedesk mirror taller so you could see yourself when standing stayed there because rate was better than most in location 
the not so goodmaintenence and service issues 2 light bulbs and sink drain control were not working at checkin fixed promptly but took 2 trips was not offered or given newspapers or turndown service despite being wyndham rewards member this seemed to be just a random occurance a colleague received both without asking charged 10day for very slow internet service room service errors resulted in cold coffee and toast waiting for a return trip for 2nd person setup they were told twice that we had 2 diners when order placed workout room is gloomy hot poorly designed and equipped and water cooler was empty apparently you can get a pass to a nearby golds gym and if you have time and want a real workout that would be a must regardless it was not ok",4.0
great for center city visit,"as an expatriot of the immediate philly region i find myself living about 3 hours away i have found the doubletree to a fantastic hotel for many reasons honestly the best nights sleep i get is there their beds are amazing 
parking is adjacent  in line w expected parking lot prices check in is hitmiss based on time of arrival rooms are well decorated clean and the views have always been great and welcomed i havent dined in so i cant offer much about the hotel restaurants you could ask for a more central location to all that center city has to offer 
have been there many times and will continue i highly recommend but with reluctance cause i want to be sure i have a room there when i want one",5.0
not the best choice,"this is not the best choice of hotels if you want to kick back and relax this hotel is the shell of a luxury hotel without the substance 
 we didnt get any sleep on thusday friday or saturday nights we could hear noise in the halls of the hotel and people getting into cars at 2 and 3 am they have banquet facilities on the same floors with guest rooms management needs to decide whether they want to host parties or cater to guests the beds were not comfortable the mattresses were lumpy and you could feel the dips you have to pay for wifi most hotels offer this for free the internet cost 995 per day they provided internet access in the lobby however there was also a fee attached they provide a book of instructions on hotel facilities an entire page was dedicated on how to make calls we tried using a calling card from your room but after numerous attempts we were unable to do so you cannot dial a toll free number from your roomwe contacted the front desk and were advised that the instructions were invalid and that there was a charge attached for making long distance calls during our stay we were locked out of our room and had to go to the front desk to have our keys recoded 
 what good things can we saythe hotel is in a great location it is located across from the faneuil hall marketplace and the quincy market it is close to the north end and many restaurants in the area the staff at check in and the doormen were all extremely polite throughout our stay",3.0
not the best hotel specially if you consider the price,"i have stayed in sheraton in may the rooms are smallish i am from europe where the rooms tend to be small so i have nothing to complain however it is very small for american standards the bathroom was probably the smallest i have ever seen it is impossible to get out of the tubeshower if the door is open wellnesfitness facility is probably the worst in the hotel  old dated would not be ok for a 23 star hotel either service was good in quality the breakfast is comparable to the spa
if you are willing to pay this price for a hotel go and search for other in boston there are better hotels in this range in all aspects",3.0
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here would recommend,we stayed here on the first leg of our fly drive holiday this was our 5th trip to usa and we like to stay in good hotels this fitted the bill exactly convenient with the metro just across the road good room excellent restaurant starbucks in the lobby and friendly and professional staff if we are back in the area i would definitely stay again,5.0
great location good value,this boutique hotel is conveniently located in the heart of manhattans upper westside neighborhood convenient to subway restaurants shopping and central park weve stayed here several times and always found the rooms although varied in size clean and comfy prices vary with the season and more popular times in nyc are obviously pricier weve overall found this hotel to be a good value and plan to come back again,5.0
wonderful 21st celebrations,came to new york to celebrate my son and his friends 21st birthdays once they had finished university i picked the w at times square as we had stayed at a w in atlanta and loved it the new york w did not disappoint on any level i had contacted patrick armano before we left england and he very kindly made sure we were well looked after we had great rooms all on the same floor and near each other  the hotel manager jon arranged for a bottle of champagne to be sent to the boys and all the staff were so good and extremely helpful the location in times square cannot be beaten if you want to be at the heart of the area it is a great hotel and has a fabulous vibrant bar to relax in at the end of a long day we had an amazing time and have wonderful memories of new york thanks to the w  patrick jon and all the staff would love to go back there in the future,5.0
will not go back  ,"my mother and i stayed at the park central hotel in nyc for 6 days in september we were quite impressed when we walked into the hotel lobby but were quickly unimpressed by the front desk guy who acted as though we were bothering him by checking in out of about 4 front desk workers i spoke to over the duration of our stay 1 was pleasant the room did not have a coffee maker or anything extra to make the stay more welcoming just shampoo and soap not even a shower cap but that isnt a big deal but when you pay 400night you think youd be getting the best of the bestbut i guess it is new york after all and it is waaay more expensive what was a big deal was our first day of housekeeping someone went into my suitcase and stole my favorite skirt i didnt notice until the next morning when i went in to get dressed for the day and realized it was gone we searched every inch of the room for it we contacted security who was really friendly and said that this does happen i had my suitcase closed but not zippedso be sure to zip and lock it ive traveled all over the world and stayed at all levels of hotels and never experienced this we kept the room locked and security ensured that no one would enter our room without a supervisor we asked that we not have our room serviced again well the next day not one but two people tried to enter our room while we were in there i told front desk who didnt seem to care in the end all we got was 100 off our 400night room for a guest complaint they wouldnt even comp the one movie we rented on the tv terrible barely covers the cost of the item that was stolen im just glad more wasnt taken from me or my mom
on a positive noteconceirge was awesome which we later found out were not employees of the hotel but a hired company placed in the hotel they were fantastic best service ever heck id go to the hotel just for info definitely not to stay
room service was crazy expensive so we never ate at the hotel so i cant judge the food but it must be good for that price
i would stay somewhere else next time for sure because of the theft the location was pretty good although i would recommend staying on the other side of times square where you are more central to everything
good luck in your hotel search",1.0
nice price for a downtown hotel,"stayed for 7 nights while attending a convention at the nearby colorado convention center it was by far the most economical hotel within walking distance of the center it is also only a block from 16th st with many shops and restaurants and its free shuttle that runs across downtown 
i chose it primarily for the location and the cost i booked the room rate that included breakfast which is much cheaper than paying for it separately if you eat at the hotel the restaurant cant handle the breakfast rush without some delays at peak times but the wait wasnt over 10 minutes we didnt eat any other meals there 
the room was clean but not spotless there was some dust on the table lamps three of the curtain hooks were disconnected from the rod which made the end hang down a bit but you had to pull them all the way closed to know 
we usually hadnt yet gone out for the day before housekeeping began their rounds in the morning and that apparently threw them off a bit as one day they forgot to make up our room other than that no housekeeping issues at all
the air conditioner coffee maker hair dryer all worked well im a big decaf drinker and had no problem getting multiple extra packets from the front desk in fact the front desk staff were very pleasant in every interaction 
plenty of hot water in the mornings my wife spent three days at the pool while i was at the convention and found it very well kept 
one tiny nitpick i could not get a pack of matches not at the front desk not at the bar 
parking at the attached garage is 16day wireless internet was free",3.0
central location  would recommend,hotel was recommended by travel agent has excellent central city location for siteseeing the trams buses shopping and eating be aware which we werent prepared for the downside of this is that you see all the homelessness in the city friendly helpful receptionists recommended local places to dine bedroom was comfortable coffee making facilities powerful shower cleaned daily ironing board and hairdryer we had a bedroom to the back of the hotel so hardly any city noise to disturb us complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings with wine in the evenings complimentary use of the computer and internet all in the reception safe deposit boxes available at reception also we would recommend the city pass if you havent been sightseeing here before you can swap one of the tours in the pass for alcatraz we would also recommend hiring a bike to visit the golden gate bridge if you want a bit of freedom we found long waits of 45min plus for the tram at the piers to return to the city centre even at offpeak season,5.0
great location for exploring san francisco,"this hotel was exactly what we were looking for and expecting for our three days in sf we got it though a flighthotel bundle on expedia and were really pleased the location is close to multiple forms of public transportation and pretty centrally located for any exploring you would do as a tourist we had an interior room so we didnt have many of the sound issues that others have mentioned but this did mean that it was rather dark 
the front desk staff was helpful though one did send us to a restaurant in the mission district that ended up being at a completely different location than what he wrote down we should have double checked online but it turned out fine we still found a great place to eat just not the one he recommended",4.0

fabulous hotel which gets better every time,"i have now stayed at this hotel on 5 occassions when in philadelphia on business and have just booked my next 12 night stay for next month this hotel is a home away from home and the only place i would consider staying in the city close to absolutely everything and with so much to do in the area i love philadelphia and tend to wander out in the evenings after work for a bite or just to chill try fado on locust and 15th or mccrossons on n20th past the franklin institute for some great places to chill also as my business trips usually include a weekend it is the perfect base from which to explore the city for the weekend but on the nights when i still have work to do or when i just want to relax the rooms are very well equiped with a large work desk and free wifi or the gym on the 4th floor which while a little small is never too crowded and is just about right for my needs i have had a varied selection of rooms on my travels some larger than others but all perfect for a longer stay the larger ones in particular rm 701 in december are well fitted out with plenty of space and would be my recommendation
parking is a little on the expensive side and not being a big breakfast eater it would be useful to have a bed and parking option for people not wanting bb food is great and the service is outstanding on my last visit i had a late flight but wanted to wander around the town for the afternoon securing a late checkout was not problem at all on previous occassions whenever i have had a question never a complaint the front desk staff have sorted it immediately on one occassion a small problem with my room had been rectified by the time i made it back up
for as long as i continue coming back to philadelphia i will return to this hotel every time keep up the great work guys and see you next month

great hotel with exceptional service,i have stayed at many hotels and i found this best western to be exceptional the room was affordable and exactly what i needed the customer service definitely exceeded my expectations thank you,5.0
will return,"the hotel was very clean throughout we were impressed
it had been a long time since staying at a hampton inn and they really wowed me first their rating was 10000 very impressive the lobby area was very inviting when encountering the staff they seem to make a conscientiousness effort to say hello very rare in this fast paced world and the continental breakfast was more than deluxe it was a full meal  superbe and the shuttle drivers on duty during our stay eddie n chris were ever so patient with us  thank you",5.0
great price great location great view,just returned from two nights on the 25th floor in the north tower could not beat the view housekeeping and the parking valet services were very good front desk soso got the room on hotwire for 96 nite the location is fabulous with newbury street a short walk away and close to the t would stay there again,4.0
needs a good dusting new staff but location is great,"so as an spg platinum ive come to expect certain things from a w hotel  it tries a little hard it feels like a nightclub but typically a nice hotel very well kept great service rooms are nice if you can get an upgrade especially 
this w does not live up the brand we went to ny for a show and although the location is perfect walking distance to lots of restaurants shopping central park the hotel is old underneath all that flashy decor you can see it in the paneling and the floors and the doors the rooms are tiny tiny tiny we were upgraded to third level of room  superior  superior what i get the hotel was full there was a wedding and of course the hurricane displaced people the bed itself was comfortable 
the bathroom was so small and the lights kept flickering the closet was actually as big as the bathroom but the light didnt work 
my favorite part of the stay sunday morning  for 60 minutes a loud horrible blaring noise coming from two doors down i called and asked about it  was told security was on it and maybe 20 minutes later i heard w staff working on it upon checking out we asked about it  no answer no response 
i also was curious about the security of the hotel every night they had people standing at the elevators asking to see our room keys the elevators had a place to put your key that was technically required to get onto the guest level floors but it didnt seem to work what was happening at that hotel that they had three guys standing at the elevators

absolutely fabuloushotel w,an incredibly wonderful experience the hotel is gorgeous we had an amazing time staying there worth every penny cant wait to go back the staff was so nice and accommodating allen and eden were both so wonderful and made the experience great they both suggested sunda as a great place to eat eden worked her magic to get us in she helped with other suggestions and helped us get our boarding passes at the end wonderful wonderful wonderful whatever whenever cant say enough,5.0
very nice and in a great location,"this hotel is just down from grand central station the location simply cant be beat
the price was also acceptable for the area
the hotel is quite small from the lobby to the rooms so dont be surprised about thatit is new york after all that being said it makes me wonder how affordable the rooms would be if you are staying alone we had a deluxe room for 2 people and it was quite tiny we were just using it as a place to sleep though so it didnt bother us 
lots of people to help you at the front desk and the lighting and decor is pretty cool",5.0
loved the ballantyne,"we stayed at the ballantyne for one day the friday after thanksgiving i was impressed that we checked in around 1030 in the morning and they put us right in a room no hassles
checkin was pleasant the staff were all friendly  the valet doorman baggage handlers front desk clerks
we booked by going directly to their website and getting a holiday special of 18900 per night their price on the ballantyne site was cheaper than any of the prices we found on other sites
room the room was beautiful its a nice touch that when you enter the room the stereo is on a classical music station
the beds are very comfortable i am 52 and my husband is 6 foot it was a bit difficult for me to climb into the bed because it was a bit high but the comfort was worth it
the room has a great coolingheating system
the bathroom is gorgeous and luxurious  marble floors garden tub separate glass enclosed shower 
the robes are comfortable and nice the towels could be a bit softer but they were the typical hotel fare
turn down service was a nice touch they turn the music back on and leave dark chocolates on the bed
we did not use the spa or restaurants so we cant comment on those we do plan to return again we used this one night stay as a meter to tell if we would like to return and we definitely will if we can get a similar price",5.0
should have listened to other reviews,"my husbands company booked us here for two nights i am writing from hotel right now after he told me where we were staying i read the terrible reviews and was very concerned i do have allergies and other reviews mentioned the stale moldy smell we decided to continue with the reservation as my husband did not want to stay at a different hotel than his coworkers 
we checked in this afternoon and were given a room on the 5th floor it was horrible my eyes started to burn and i got a headache within minutes they had an ionizerair cleaner running on the top of the tv stand so that should have been a clue we left the room immediately and tried to determine what we should do we had just parked our car with valet and had dragged all our luggage in with a hot and cranky 5 year old we went down to the front desk and spoke with the assistant manager she said she totally understood my situation as she suffers from allergies she said it was worse on the 5th floor and gave me a key to a room on the second floor i looked at it and there was a difference in the smell but still musty we decided to just stick it out for these two days figuring it was not worth all the hassle to change my husbands company was paying and they had secured the rate etc had this been coming out of our own pocket we would have moved rooms immediately
ok now the positives the staff here has been very friendly we love the location and always enjoy staying in historic hotels this place is interesting and memorable and has a lot of character it is right next to the alamo and a quick walk to the river we had a great time in their pool very large compared to the doubletree airport location we just came from
i just dont understand why they have let this hotel go downhill like this carpets are old dirty the halls smell musty and stale decor is cheap 70s in the rooms and the bathrooms need a serious updating this could be a really great place if someone took the time to update the rooms if you have a problem with mold dust mites or if you are allergy sensitive stay somewhere else they were not surprised at the front desk when i complained",1.0
just what i needed,arriving saturday for a sunday seminar i found the jane hotel to be a more than pleasant surpriseits location on a quanint cobblestone street lined with well maintained brownstones is charming front desk personnel were kind professional and courteous the gentleman on duty the evening i arrived was able to direct me to an excellent all night deli my cabin style room while small was clean well appointed bath shoes and robe provided the tv lights alarm clock and internet all worked finean underbed set of drawers were large enough to store my goods a safe is also provided to lock important items when out of room  one large window afforded me a view of the river and skyline the shared bath was clean and neat renovations were underway in the lobby area which by the way is wonderfully vintage  and i hope to see the final results on my next nyc trip  overall if you are looking for quiet clean and very affordable nyc accomadations then the jane should suit your needs,4.0
pretty great stay nice hotel,"just got back from a really pleasant weekend in chicago i am from new york city and have never been to chicago there is lots to do too much for one weekned and it is a beautiful place full of nice people i chose the hotel burnham based on trip advisor reviews and i liked that it was a historical building the place is really beautiful i loved our rooms they may be a little small but i have never had a very huge hotel in the middle of a city before the beds were really comfy and the ceilings were high the room felt really cosy and elegant also at night you didnt hear any kind of street noise really awesome considering we were on what is considered a busy street
 this hotel is in the loop like i said i have never been to chicago so i had no idea what all these neighborhoods meant what was the difference between magnificent mile and the loop or lincoln park well the loop is the business center theater center it is also right next to millenium park which is a nice place to walk around chicago isnt that large so you can walk around to just about any area and the subway is really easy to navigate so that is a big plus there was plenty of regular shopping such as hm oldnavy walgreens macys marshall fields gap ny and co and more if you want highend shopping you go to magnificent mile 
the staff was so friendly and welcoming reginald greeted us and after we checked in gave us the tour of the room the staff seems small which is a great bonus to being in a boutique hotel because they all knew who we were and we knew them they were all really helpful with recommending places to eat calling for reservations and giving directions on where to go when my moms wallet was lost they looked up phone numbers of the taxi companies so i could call and see if it was found 
the hotel has a small gym but it was up to date and never crowded the restuarant atwood cafe had very busy lunch and dinners filled with locals we only ate a breakfast there it was good and really pretty inside",5.0
terrible accommodation horrible neighbors,"renovated with new furniture but dirty and stains all over the bed you can hear foot steps upstairs not to mention the next door you may be trouble sleeping if you have wrong neighbors like i did

great new hotel,we stayed at the solamar over the independece day weekend this year so it had been opened for only three months then the location is great within the walking distict to the restaurants and bars of the gaslamp district which by the way is not that interesting on its own but in the evening its fun to hang out there the decor is great beautiful colors artwork very modern and swanky  it reminded me a bit of a pottery barn catalogue  awesome outside bar great atmosphere you definitely should start your evening out there the service was ok a bit too much on the hip side  i prefer the old school politeness but had no problems the rooms were really nice medium in size but the decor makes up for it loved the great idea to put sliding doors in the bathroom  saves a lot of space we didnt try the hotel restaurant  we dined at chive  loved it overall a great hotel i also liked the fact that its new which adds some sort of freshness to it  and hey nothing is worn out yet,4.0
great for business,"i have only stayed at the wyndham for business purposes having stayed at half a dozen hotels in boston this is definitely the best for business and not the best for leisure travel while it is near certain interesting places the immediate area is dead at night because its the financial district go elsewhere for vacations
for business travelers the place is ideal the customer service is very high and the rooms are alway comfortable sometimes they were much larger than i was expecting never tried the barrestauarnt but always looked like a good place for a drink",4.0
great staffproperty improving,"we stayed at this hotel for a week the staff is welcoming and helpful i do agree that there is construction noise and we asked for a room on the newly redone floors to accomodate that by the 3rd day the noise on floor 26 was very minimal and there was more noise from other hotel guests and at that not much 
parking rates are very typical for not only marriott hotels but for the san antonio area downtown they know people come to see the riverwalkalamo so the make money in parkingany city does the same if you come to sa just for that area i would not rent a careverything is accessible either walking or with the inexpensive downtown trolley system the airport is also close so taxi fare is not outrageous
our room was newly redone and very nice bed very comfortable nice tv and bathroom area with outside sink housekeeping was especially cordial and worked around our schedule all of the staff was quick to acknowledge us no matter what area of the hotel we were in the bellmen are wonderful helpfulfriendly and ready to answer any questions you have about the area as was the concierge who was very helpful and kind at all times customer service is excellent here
the gym is large by hotel standards everything youd need and very nice equipment treadmillselliptical machines free weights stationery machines and even a smith machine which is rare in hotel gyms if you jog the riverwalk before 8am is ideal for a runyou can go all the way to the opposite end which is new and where the locks and small damn area areno stores or shops just beautiful flowers and scenerylook for the overhead canopy of woven treesnicethe pool area is a bit outdated but is indooroutdoor and well maintained and relaxing the bar in the hotel lobby is a great place to relax maybe catch the game scoresbut its def not a sportsbar and they make great lemon drop martinis
the proximity to the rivercenter mall and the riverwalk make this an ideal place to stay the food court at rivercenter is great for a quick bitenever seen an ihop on the run before but it was goodpancakes omelets etc cooked to order
if you do have a car try to get away from the riverwalk area to eat biga on banks pricey but wonderfulask for beth to be your server when you make a reservation josephine street grill for a perfect example of a great chicken fried steak mashed potatoes and gravy and all burgers steaks and salads make this a great choice night or day we do like boudros on the riverwalk but again it is not inexpensive
best places to buy souveniers is the walgreens within walking distance about 4 blocks or cvs on the riverwalk
we go to san antonio often and i would definitely stay at the mrc again and just call ahead to ask for a newly renovated room",4.0
outstanding  surpassed all expectations,"i had known about the hotel for some time before actually staying there and had heard very positive things upon making a spurofthemoment decision to stay in manhattan late on a saturday evening we had enjoyed a wonderful day and didnt want to leave i remembered the hotel called and that was the start of an absolutely firstrate experience the rate was good the service impeccable the decor and room far exceeded my expectations 
dont let the typically small manhattan entryway fool you  once you enter the hotel and pass the front desk guests are treated to a very spacious and wonderfulldecorated environment you honestly have no awareness that you are right in the middle of the maelstrom that is times square  its almost strangely insulated 
the staff were unquestionably excellent check in was fast smooth and extremely courteous we were personally shown to our room which was wonderful and a huge surprise since we were expecting the normal shoebox room one normally finds in manhattan
the next huge surprise was breakfast included in the room rate and a wonderful spread served by welcoming and helpful staff 
all in all i could not have asked for a better stay in any hotel in manhattan or anywhere else this hotel should be 1 on the tripadvisor list i cannot speak highly enough about it",5.0
great hotel for the price supurb location,stayed for 5 nights last week as many people have stated before the rooms are small and dated but as i booked the cheapest room i was expecting that that was the only downside and the rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels dailynice comfy beds great shower massive tv but i suppose you dont go to nyc and stay in your room too much to see the breakfast is a bonus too lots of choice but the dining room gets full quickly as not many tables the staff are really helpful and friendly this hotel is superbly located 2 subways nearby however we decided to walk down to midtown not that far to times square lots of great places to eat nearby if like burgers pizzas try big nicks at the end of the street dont let the appearance put you off the food burgers are amazing and really cheap compared to other places for new york prices this hotel is great value for money and if you book early they have some great deals available,4.0
washington,"in regards to the location it is good for its proximity to dupont circle and quality dining however it is a fair distance from the nearest metro stations dupont circle  red line farragut west  orange and blue lines to access the national mall it is a 10 block walk or 5 block walk to metro 
the hotel is older styling but the room was very large and nicely appointed

above  beyond expectation,"we have had a wonderful experience each and every time we stay the staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable about the area they have great recommendations for attractions activities  restaurants that are slightly off the beaten path
 the area director of individual travel has gone above and beyond expectation time and time again assisting us with all of our needs down to the very last detail we feel confident that the monaco will always ensure that all of our needs are met and everything is perfect
i am very pleased with the monaco and would highly recommend it you know you are in good hands when you are not just another guest to the hotel you are a new found friend of the kimpton family",5.0
would definitely stay here again,"we have just returned from our stay at 6 columbus and our experience was very different to that of some of the other guests 
we booked a queen room for a reduced rate via the quikbook website the quikbook site clearly stated that the room was for a maximum of 2 people upon arrival it was clear that booking via quikbook meant that you were given the smallest rooms in the hotel there was no way that 2 people could stay comfortably in this queen room
there was only 1 single wardrobe no natural light hardly any floor space around the bed and nowhere to store our 2 large suitcases 
i spoke to lula on the front desk and she went out of her way to ensure that we were happy with our accommodation she showed me 2 other rooms which were much more suitable for couples and managed to offer us a larger queen room at an extremely reasonable upgrade price throughout our stay lula made a point of checking that everything was ok with our room 
with regards to the rest of the hotel we really couldnt fault it all of the staff were extremely friendly particularly the doormen we didnt try the restaurant but we did drink at the bar a few times and they even served sushi to us at the bar my only gripe would be that the bar area is quite small with limited seating 
the room we actually stayed in was a great size the double wardrobe was more than adequate and there were large drawers under the bed also the ipod docking station was a nice touch as were the khiels toiletries in the bathroom and the free daily newspapers the room temperature control took some getting used to but overall it served its purpose and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was very welcme after a hard days sightseeing the bed was also very comfortable
housekeeping did a great job at keeping the room immaculate and also turned down the bed every night leaving little treats on the duvet
in addition to the great service and comfortable room the hotel is in the most amazing location the time warner centre is literally across the road which houses a large whole foods market and lots of nice restaurants starbucks is next door and there were several places to get a great breakfast just up the street columbus circle was right on the doorstep including the best entrance to central park 
overall we really enjoyed our stay at 6 columbus and we would definitely stay here again on our next visit to new york",4.0
great staff couldnt make up for rundown noisy hotel,"we were looking for a beachside town and ocean beach fit the bill we stayed at the ocean beach hotel which looks like its been around for a long long time judging by some old pictures we saw including pictures of the hotel before a street separated it from the beach the front desk staff and cleaning staff were very professional accommodating and friendly 
we stayed on the second floor with a partial ocean view rates for each of our days varied between 140160 our view also included colorful local characters as one reviewer has noted who hang out near the powmia memorial across the street the local color also attracted the sd police three times who twice hauled away people the third time appeared to be some kind of contact visit by cops to talk to the homeless the skaters other rough characters and the welldressed people attracted to them drug sales 
that said we walked around day and night and never felt threatened  no aggressive panhandling and little panhandling in any case no need to watch wallets etc like we might have felt elsewhere the vibe was good
ocean beach has done a good job of deflecting chain stores although the foughtover starbucks up the street from ob hotel easily had the biggest crowds of the coffee shops we frequented in fact our find was that one should hit a local coffee shop besides the lines being shorter folks are remarkably friendly and open the coffee is excellent and the pastries are local and better hit the same place three days in a row and youll be shooting the breeze like youve lived there a year so while the anticorporate mentality may be a bit militant it makes for a pleasant main street to wander up and down 
now to the hotel the room smelled musty and the carpet had that mildlywet feeling from highhumidity climates our bathroom sink faucet swiveled leftandright though not by design the toilet was constantly on the verge of stopping up did the previous tenants through a baggie of dope down it there was a table on the patio but the patio had some kind of halfworn off macadam covering that made it uneven repairmen were working their way down patios sanding that stuff down which was very noisy during the day the room had two chairs on opposite sides we used the bed for sitting and as a table
there was a fridge and microwave
the wall had been torn and repaired badly there was a new door to the bathroom and while that was fine the frame around it was unpainted 
an attempt has been made to spruce up the courtyard  box planters on the 2nd and 3rd floor railings container plants below strings of lighting overhead and so on some of the lights were burnt out and the fountain in the middle was bone dry indicative of good intentions that are not wellfunded
a good cable tv selection and free wireless internet were bonuses
as others have noted the rooms are very noisy from newlyweds on one side theyll learn i guess to a guitarist practicing his heavy metal riffs presumably for a local show one evening to drunken screeching in the courtyard to the sound of harleys being revved to one fight on newport ave outside our room to revelers at all hours including nine am one morning to a pretty good ad hoc music jam session think three of the talented players were sailors at the powmia memorial to fire trucks to a thumping bass from a nearby bar to the occupants above us daring walk to the bathroom to people yelling at their buddies across the street  the joint is noisy weve lived in 247 congested areas of several large cities abroad and in the us and never had noise like this so if you want a quiet weekend by the beach this aint the place by a long shot
we enjoyed the town and its freewheeling environment but hated the hotel  save the staff
we figure for the annoying noise level and the rundown condition of the hotel its worth about half the price we paid per night and a major chunk of that is what ocean beach hotel is all about location location location",1.0
confirm your reservation,i had read the many reviews of this hotel and having booked through another booking service and not directly with the hotel i heeded the advice of others and tried to email them at least twice to ensure they had my reservation even though i had the email to prove it and had paid a 10 reservation fee no reply to email sent to the web site so just before leaving tried the other email on the hotel site and received a confirmation notice just as well because when we arrived from the airport with printed out reservation in hand we were told that we were not on their system and the hotel was full it wasnt until i provided proof with the confirmation email from the hotel that they took us seriously the receptionist was very nice and tried to sort it out by ringing the manager but he did not respond and then the lady for the evening shift appeared we ended up being given someone elses booking for the first night at a lesser standard than we had reserved and were told that we would have to move in the morning and the manager would sort it out so back we went the following morning at 0800 and met the manager who was very nice also who told us we could leave our rooms in another room which would be ours after it was cleaned on our return we returned late that night to find our bags had been moved to a smaller room but at least it had an ensuite the bed was so uncomfortable as you could feel the wires  springs through the covers in the end they never charged us so we only paid the deposit for the 2 night stay the location was close to the metro but still some way from the central shopping area but pretty close to central park make sure you have written proof of reservations when you arrive otherwise you might be left looking for alternative accommodation,3.0
great place to stay  very friendly,everybody was so very nice loved the breakfast buffet and the evening reception rooms were clean bed very comfortable the garden tub was nice i was so busy i didnt miss that they dont have a pool my only regret is that i didnt have time to get to the milk and cookies buffet,4.0
perfect for a anniverary getaway weekend,we arrived early on a saturday in july during a very busy weekend in sf we found out that the marathon was happening the next morning so were concerned about traffic getting out the next morning the staff checked our bags in so we could start our sightseeing day and were very helpful and friendly about directing us to parking and easing our fears about leaving downtown with all the street closures the next day room was cleanquiet and decent sized for the two of us there are plenty of places to eat nearby and for location to tours bus rides transportation and the wharf attractions it is a perfect stop parking at the garage next door is pricey but we expected that based on reading other reviews so we were prepared i would not have felt comfortable leaving our car on the street because it was so busy and crowded in that area on a summer saturday,4.0
great location  big room,we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel it is in a phenomenal location  just a few blocks from independence hall and the liberty bell shopping restaurants and historic buildings parking is 21 per day which is automatically added to your bill so keep that in mind when budgeting although you can come and go as you please the parking garage is quite a cluster so dont expect to just get up and go everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful the maids front desk breakfast personel and maintance were all ready to bend over backwards for us our room was very spacious  much more than a standard hotel room the bathroom was very small though thankfully the sink was not in the bathroom there is very little space to change in the bathroom one tip pandoras lunch box just down the road was phenomenal we had a variety of foods and went back more than once  everything was sooo good,4.0
across from the convention center,"this hilton is in a prime location right in chinatown you are smack in the heart of philly you can walk take a taxi or utilize public transportation parking her will run you 3000 a day let me tell you about our room it was an enormous king corner room with several windows that let in the sunshine of the city the sleep number bed can be adjusted on both sides for a comfortable shared night of sleep
the restaurant and lounge was beautiful and located on high floor of the hotel the staff was very attentive and quickly responded to all request i spent a week here and was treated like a live in guest at night this can be a very quiet area but it is close to offices restaurants and shopping by day",4.0
great location average marriott,"i stayed at the hotel for two nights while attending a convention at the attached philadelphia convention center for convenience if youre attending a convention there its super the location is right next to the city hall  and there are dozens and dozens of restaurants within an easy walk 
my room on the 9th floor was very comfortable and clean a typical marriott my room was ultra quiet despite being in the middle of the central business district i was able to rest well during the night on the super comfortable bed and do work during the day without disruption the internet was highspeed and excellent
the staff were very friendly and helpful the starbucks in the lobby a nice touch overall a very good choice for business travel",4.0
great location average room but still had an issue,"how can i be fair   lets see  
my husband and i stayed their with my daughter over spring break the location is excellent literally within walking distance from the riverwalk and alamo my daughter is 7 and the walk was not an issue for her the rooms are average if anything they are outdated but overall pretty good  possibly could be a little cleaner but it is nitpicky stuff i noticed so not bad overall rooms were cleaned everyday with plently of clean towels as far as the pool  dont get excited it is outside next to the highway so if you dont mind being on display to every car on the highway then its not a big deal the continental breakfast is held in the lobby where you check in so there is very limited room the food was good  your typical donuts bagels cereal juice coffee and such they advertised free wireless internet connection in the rooms but we could not get a connection 
the bad is we originally booked this trip and reserved the rooms with a credit card because my husband travels during the week and typically stays at days inn when traveling he is enrolled in their trip reward program after the inital reservation was made we decided to use his trip reward points to pay for the room and save a little cash for all of the other activities in san antonio when he called to book the room he let them know i had already reserved the room we just needed to verify we were going to use the points to pay i had also called to cancel the second room i reserved as my inlaws had made a seperate reservation on their own we arrived checked in and everything was fine with the points however when i returned home and checked my account my card had been charged for the rooms yep tow of them i called to explain the situation and i was told that they probably just ran the card for preauthorization and it wouldnt be posted to my account and that i should give it a few days of course it posted and i was charged to i called back again to get my money refunded i was told they are busy and would look into it no return call so i called back and was notified i was charged because i was a no show and that they know my husband checked in but had a seperate room for me and charged me since i did not cancel i explained the situation and how my husband frequently stays there i did cancel one room i did not have my cancellation number to prove it but of course not the other because that is the one we stayed in apparently when we called to use the trip reward points they made an additional reservation  not so sure about that but that is the only conclusion i can come to after no cooperation what so ever my husband notified them we would be calling their corporate office they kindly informed us they are not a affiliated with corporate and that they are independently owned and basically that we could take a hike so sorry 
hopefully this isnt a reoccuring incident at the motel and i am the only unfortunate person to have this happen  but though i would share just in case",3.0

great hotel and great location,"this hotel was a great union square location the lobby was packed and loud so i did not have high expectations upon checkin however when i arrived at my room in tower 3 i was pleasantly surprised it had all the charm of a boutique hotel the single room was small but utilized the space well and was quite cozy my boyfriend and i were only spending one night in the city and then heading up north to wine country but we almost extended our stay at the hilton san fransisco union square because we liked it so much
the hotel staff was so nice and we had a very pleasant experience i will return to this hotel the next time im staying in the city",5.0
gem was great and cesar was awesome,"i almost hate to say how great the gem hotel in chelsea is because my selfish side would prefer to keep it a secret its a very afforadable alternative to the big chain hotels in mid town which can cost literally hundreds more

loved the quad bunk room,we were looking for a clean safe and reasonably priced basecamp for our family of four on our last trip to nyc the quad bunk room was a great find sure the incredibly efficient layout means there is no privacy and everyone gets a single bed  but thats a small price to pay for the small price and our 8 year old girls were thrilled to sleep up high,4.0
great hotel,"positives
 large rooms
 nice decor
 refrigeratorsink in the room
 decent restaurant i had breakfast only 
 location was next to stadium and a 5minute shuttle ride to downtown 1520 minute walk 
 service was great i ordered a taxi and it was there immediately staff was nice
negatives
 couldnt order breakfast room service for the next day when i called the evening before the person said hed stick the order on the computer but he hoped it wouldnt get lost so i was worried it wouldnt go through so i had to call the following morning to doublecheck
 once when i called for a shuttle from downtown they didnt pick up at the right spot and i saw the shuttle pass by so i had to call again one of the shuttle drivers wasnt esp friendly
overall i liked this place unfortunately had a view of the inner courtyard pool on top was small but nice views",4.0
great stay  will be back,"my husband and i spent 2 nights at the nolitan the hotel is modern and well designed hipster but not too hipster the front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful as were both doormen our room wasnt ready when we got there but we were quickly found a room that was ready and on a high floor with a balcony 
the beds are so luxurious that next time were booking an extra night so we can stay in bed all day they have turn down service with slippers and chocolates on your pillow and the mini bar prices are actually reasonable and theyve got a good selection vosges chocolates pop chips et al there are a selection of magazines for you to peruse vogue gq time out and free wi fi and bath products by red flower
the hotel is minutes away from soho shopping tory burch uniqlo jcrew madwell top shop and the new museum as well as great restaurants la esquina torrisi parm lombardis pulinos balthazar etc 
the bar at ellabess downstairs was great we hung out for 12 priced drinks and apps at happy hour the roof is also accessible  i can imagine that it would be amazing in the summertime
we will definitely be back so certainly i almost want to book now before people find out how great this hotel is stay sweet nolitan

one of the best hotels in sf,"we stayed here for three nights in a suite  two adults in the king bedroom and our adult son in the living room wonderful space pullout couch was excellent hes 62 and he was very comfortable bathroom huge shower terrific big two person soaking tub with jets city noise outside but thats to be expected  hotel is very quiet internally
we had a car and valet service was good
service in general is the problem here and its just spotty  not mean examples asked for a coffee maker in room was told it would be there never saw it coffee in the lobby was very good though so we gave up alos manager emailed me in advance asking for input so i told him we were would like to have enough towels and bedding for our third person he agreed i mentioned it again when we checked in but we ended up having to ask yet again before we saw pillows and a couple of ratty old but clean blankets for the pull out oh and the down comforter on our king bed was an old worn blanket too encased in sheets
generally the space was well planned clean spacious and comfortable with good lighting this a great location for walking to the moma yerba buena gardens union square and shopping chinatown the embarcadero and lots of wonderful restaurants",4.0
great small hotel in nyc,we chose park79 for its quiet location and good price for a long weekend in nyc yes the room was small but its new york small is fine it was clean comfortable and served our needs very well as we were out and about all day while our bathroom was very small it did the job staff were terrific and always very nice wed definitely choose this hotel again,4.0
a sophisticated escape,my husband and i chose this new hotel for a muchneeded onenight getaway the first room they brought us to smelled like smoke which i noticed and mentioned immediately the staff were gracious and admitted the problem saying they cant police their guests and moved us to a nicer room even though they were fully committed the room was spacious with a king size bed desk armchair a settee and other table the bathroom was done in a unique spanish tile and was very large with a dualhead shower the bed was outrageously comfortable we enjoyed the included wont call them free for this price snacks and bevs we had massages at the spa which were excellent and given by the top guy there the pool is warm and lovely our only complaints were an intermittent highpitched whining sound perhaps the elevator and the fact that our breakfast did not arrive at the requested time and required two phone calls to resolve ohand the wifi requires a password which they do not include in their printed guidewhy not all in all a good stay and i wish we could afford to stay longer,4.0
very nice one night stay,we arrived late at 9pm and checkin was a breeze the lady at the front was very friendly rooms were nice and the beds extra comfy also the room was very clean like someone else said this room was as nice as some 4 star rooms we have stayed in breakfast was very good only small complaint was the hot tub was cold will stay here again as everyone was very friendly and the rooms were nice the price of the room for 94 seemed like a good value,5.0
showing a little age and could use a cleaning,"got this on priceline for a steal so i have no reason to complain too much only stayed 1 night
positives great front desk staff very comfortable beds pretty nice bedrooms and lobby super nice shuttle driver
negatives not very clean bedroom hair on bed and floor make up on one of the pillow cases very small bathroom that smelled like mold on the end of main street are still close to the trolly but after dark kind of seems a little scary did not complain about the cleaniness so do not know how they would have reacted",3.0
excellent location friendly staff,"had a fantastic room on the 28th floor and despite how huge and busy this hotel is the staff were always extremely friendly and helpful in a hotel this size its surprising that staff in the lobby remembered my name for the duration of my short visit there maybe i stand out  i dont know 
the rooms were great but i was extremely disappointed with the cost of the in room internet service extremely expensive given the price of the rooms and the fact that this is san francisco and the poor mobile phone coverage up that high
if its in your price range its definitely worth staying here as its very easy to grab the bart from the airport and its in a good location for shopping and getting around san francisco",5.0

great value for a good hotel,"this is my 5th stay this year not a new property but priced accordingly and the staff have gone out of their way to be accommodating 
in response to some of the critics
1 the breakfast is priced the same as comparable marriotts and the quality is good
2 the hotel is clean

if you can pay the tariff its a great place to stay,we enjoyed the hotel not a very large room but it was on a high floor and the view of the harbour was super the technology in the room is way exceptional and the service is excellent although they made a big deal of asking about my husbands birthday and then ignored it after we arrived,4.0
fabulous hotel  prime location great staff large clean  comfortable rooms,travelled to dc with my family this summer and had the good fortune of choosing the carlyle suites on a few recommendations the place is simply wonderful the rooms are large clean and luxurious complete with flat screen tv wifi kitchenette and even tempurpedic mattresses they have a great restaurant a fantastic breakfast buffet and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful just a short walk to many shops restaurants and the dc metro i will stay here every time i travel to dc this is certainly among the best lodging choices our nations capital has to offer,5.0
walking in downtown seattle has a price," and its not a cheap one
the roosevelt hotel is located in downtown seattle which means you can walk from here to practically every major landmark in this beautiful pacific northwest city whether you want to walk to pike place or to the space needle the roosevelt hotel is a great option 
elegant foyer cozy rooms just across the street from barns and noble which if you come from abroad is always a treat
the only think lacking here is a restaurant of its own that holds up to the reputation of the hotel the pub around the corner which is accessible through the lobby is ok but just ok filled with americana and levers from beer barrels the place offers a small variety of items for breakfast having lunch there is just not worthy go to the market and have sea food lots of it
expensive but i didnt spend a single dime on public transportation or gas just parked in and walked around location location location",4.0
this property runs the gamut,"overall this is a respectable property with all the amenities that one might expect from the embassy suites brand i would have no reservations about returning over and over again  however there are a few items to consider for the occasional traveler
rates excellent on corporate policies finding the appropriate room allowing early checkin if possible shuttle service tofrom airport and t station 
rates very good on housekeeping effieiciency of service and a professional presentation
rates fair on staff demeanor the hospitality hour and breakfast although they are provided they are not as extensive as at other embassy suites properties during the managers reception we had our sodas in styrofoam cups and no one offered us any other beverages 3 days in a row the breakfast is plentiful but not prepared with any great care  the food is allowed to get cold in the trays and the bacon was so soggy as to be inedible on two mornings the front desk staff as i mentioned earlier is efficient and capable but certainly not overly warm and friendly this in stark contrast to the desk staff at the embassy suites manhattan 
needs improvement the only real issue we had with this property was the lack of selfservice laundry facilities or if they existed they were not mentioned in the service guide and the little store in the lobby horrendously overpriced and poorly stocked sodas are only sold in a vending machine down there and the desk had no change 
many reviewers have mentioned the neighborhood  and while we can see their point of view we certainly did not feel unsafe we found a spectacular pizza parlor three blocks from the hotel as directed by one of the shuttle drivers that we would never have encountered if we had stayed within the confines of the building we walked from the t in the daylight hours and called for a shuttle when dark that only because one must traverse a construction site with very little light 
good value",4.0
super staff great service,"very friendly and helpful staff 
no silly fees for all the little stuff like wifi soft drinks in your room etc 
classy  the free coffee was not from a machine but made by a brista in the lobby

great place to stay,"we stayed at the topaz july 35 2009 we found the staff to be extremely courteous and friendly rooms were nice size and very comfortable and clean room rates was great for dc parking is expensive but we were advised by a staff member that parking is free on the weekends and holidays this saved us 70 or more by parking on the street the staff member actually walked down the block a little found us a spot and held it til we pulled our car into the spot hotel is 3 blocks to the metro line in quiet safe neighborhood great restaurants nearby couldnt think of a nicer place to stay would definately stay there again
la luna is a great restaurant with breakfast lunch and dinner good food and good prices right around the corner highly recommmend",5.0
perfect location great service,"3 night weekend stay a week ago for combination of business and pleasure room was a king park view and was as advertised in photos on this site i was very happy with the style of the room and spent a good amount of time in the eames chair and at the desk getting work done on day 1 all service was impeccable prompt and highly responsive including 2 room service meals great sushi platter from nomi serveral other special requests and car service to dinner one night
the location is right in the middle of mag mile easy walk to river loop shopping lots of great restaurants and red line l stop 23 blocks away if you dont feel like hiking down to loop or further north
stopped into the nomi lounge on way out to dinner on sat night it was definitely hopping and crowded i can see why a table for 20 would have been tough per review below but we didnt encounter any attitude by anyone working at this hotel  all were very gracious and helpful also didnt see any indication of security issues at all and felt completely safe walking in and around the hotel at all times
general vibe of this place was quiet understated with small boutique hotel feel seemed to be mainly business guests while i was there i would definitely go back but might try different place next time for some variety",5.0
great customer service,the people were great my fiance asked me to marry him on this trip and the hotel was very helpful giving him phone numbers and anything esle he needed to prepare the other thing that will bring us back is location and the shuttle thomas was the bomb he took us where we wanted to go and picked us up which was very helpful we saved time gas and confusion the pool was a little small but everything else was great we would definatley stay again,4.0
great location  did i say great location excellent location,the hotel is a short walk from the muni at van ness and the west bound f and buses stop practically right out front east bound is really close as well great resturants next door cav and zuni great coffee place cafe trieste  which also has free wifi across the street and great bars close as well pizza zone is a few blocks away on south valencia that is open late the rooms are small but when will you be there except to sleep but there is no air and no fan i brought the portable the pillows are flat and the towels are scratchy the shower has no water pressure but the place was clean david was very friendly and helpful i would stay there again but i would research parking since the lot the hotel recomends is spendy also not handicap friendly the elevator would be difficult for a wheel chair or walker,3.0
a welcome suprise,booked my one night stay through hotwire for 70 we drove all day from reno on 0601 to catch our flight to honolulu the following morning arriving somewhat tiredcheck in did not take very long and we were assigned a room on the 6th floor somewhat near the elevators i was concerned at first but after lying on the bed after a minutesi knew i would get a good nights sleep didnt hear any planes taking off that some other reviewers mentioned we tried the buffet dinner at the cafe in the lobby20 per person it seemed just okbut maybe i was too tired to enjoy it if youre looking for a place near lax for a few daysbook through hotwire and cross your fingers a few blocks away is the marriott which seems to be a nice place too parking at the hilton is 17day but it seemed to be a secure underground garage i would definitely stay here again but only if i booked it through hotwire,4.0
clean quiet bland and cheap,this hotel is close to the river walk about a 510 trek but the rooms are about onehalf the cost recently given a cosmetic facelift the rooms are clean and quietexcept for the trains for which the helpful clerks will give you earplugs if you ask we paid 99 a night during the final four which we thought was a bargain,4.0
call anthony melchiorri this is a hotel impossible candidate,"i found the sheraton dallas to be so cheap that i would have been better off staying at a more mid range hotel they lacked in service lacked in quality and failed to deliver a good guest experience shameful as i now read reviews i see other guests experienced the same problems over and over
at checkin i dealt with a front desk agent that seemed overworked and didnt really care to be on duty the front desk failed to deliver on room location requests and failed to inform on delivery options for a guest folio or receipt apparently you have a choice between emailed folio or delivery to your room i now wonder if there was a similar choice for newspapers that i was never offered
once in my room i enter to find all the lights off guests shouldnt have to fumble for their phones and flashlights simply to turn on a bedroom lamp the room otherwise was ok it appeared clean but was slightly on the small side there were no offensive odors but it seemed within fifteen minutes any time i entered the room i began to feel stuffed up and suffered from sneezes i found it odd the closet lacked a luggage rack and housekeeping never replaced the laundry bag taken from the closet
the bathroom was sized appropriately with plenty of space to operate but seriously lacked towels im all for helping the environment but leaving a room only stocked with two towels is laughable they didnt even have a bath mat just two bath towels two hand towels and one wash cloth i was not pleased i requested more towels and it took 23 minutes to deliver what would be considered a full towel set the shower had rust marks on the tub floor and was in need of a full tub replacement there was a mystery hole in the ceiling above the bathtub
bedding wise they offered decent pillows blankets and sheets but no fitted mattress cover so every morning you wake up with a sheet curled under your feet or feet touching a bare dirty disgusting mattress how can a brand name socalled full service hotel not offer a fitted sheet for a mattress thats something youd expect from a bad motel
the sheratons hallways and common areas were very dirty during my stay there were many empty beer bottles just left on the floor in the morning i came back one night to find a housekeepers vacuum just laying the floor in the hallway i think this location needs serious help when it comes to the housekeeping department additionally they need to stop with the cheap green initiatives its one thing to save a couple bucks on the lights or skimp on towels but now theyve permanently lost my business because of those aggravations if i wanted to be green id go camping i wouldnt stay at a hotel at a hotel i have a minimum level of expectations that help me with my business travel this hotel did not meet even minimum requirements",1.0
excellent environmentally friendly facility,i was very pleased with a recent hotel stay at the att executive education and conference center we paid a very reasonable price for a clean and comfortable room while staying at the hotel it was wonderful to see the environmentally conscious steps taken in the building and management of the entire facility  especially the indoor air quality control and the use of local materials in construction recommended for anyone traveling to austin,4.0
dont choose this hotel,choose this hotel as it was a landmark of nyc and had read a lot about it my reservation was made 3 months in advance and paid about 350 usdollars per night based on the condition that my room would not be in the back side where according to internet work in a close building did not allow you to sleep of course by room did face these works and could not sleep as from 6 am which gives a bad opinion of the reservation system in this hotel the room was clean but small and unsatisfactory fitted  wardrobe too smal even for one person breakfat was fine and lobby bar great but you do not need to pay this uncomfortable hotel to attend to their music eveings as a guest i would never repeat as guest of this hotel can get better things in manhattan for less money,1.0
location location,located right on union square you are in the middle of it all shopping access to sightseeing is easy good food walking distance our room was very clean and housekeeping didnt mind us sleeping in my kids loved the glass elevators the original part of this hotel was very nice with chandeliers and updated ammenities in rooms like a dock for your ipod concierge was helpful and all around hotel staff were pleasant,4.0

the best part of the trip,my husband and i went for the family day long weekend the trip started out a bit of a disaster almost missed the flight the airline lost our luggage but when we got to our hotel everything felt better we had no complaints with the exception of one of the concierge i think his name was diego i was asking him about reasonable options of getting to the airport in newark from the most connected city i told him that we took the transit here and it was just fine  he was shocked that we would do such a thing he suggested hiring a limo or the other option was taking a cab which would cost me about 120 although i think he was trying to be helpful i found him to be quite snotty everyone else was lovely,5.0
worst part of our trip,"this hotel made me wish i had missed my flight they failed to send me a car when i ordered one online through the econcerige because they sent it to my travel agent not the email i had provided no one helped me out of my cab with our luggage 2 bags and a stroller with a 8 month old 
 the room was small and very dirty duvet was stained by droll and had been turned inside out to cover it the bathroom shower had tile that was poorly done so the water stood at your feel instead of draining our sinks drain was backed up not good when you need to clean your babys bottle all the ice machines were broken and tried to charge me 14 to get ice from room service the wall paper was peeling in the bathroom and the paint job was fast and streaky if i were them id get the money back from the painters
 hotel room didnt have a room service menu called twice for it and they said a manager would bring it right up after a hour and a half i gave up and ordered blindly from room service three hours after i ate someone brought a menu up waking up my sleeping kid we went to the concierge to rent a private car because getting a cab at that hotel was impossible he wanted 111 an hour they were under contract to rip us off i guess with the ritz hotel i never paid more then 80 an hour i went to the bell men who helped me get another car
 the hotel elevator is a death trap and lawsuit waiting to happen we tried to get in one and it started to close my husband put his hand in it failed to stop so put his leg in it clamped down hurting him it took all my strength and his banging on the doors for it to let go we had to file an injury report which they called us at midnight to give us the info so rude next day we were getting on the elevator and the elevator car suddenly just wen up with the doors open 
 the positive of this hotel good location the burger i had from room service was excellent the bellmen at the end of our trip was great they should run the hotel",1.0
if the company hadnt paid id be annoyed,"i stayed here for 8 nights on a business trip so had no choice in the matter upon arrival i was greeted by a male receptionist in jeans and a football shirt who moseyed over from the bar area to check me in at the weekend he was replaced by more professional looking staff but it was a strange opening sight the room was okay sized for american standards with a decent sized bathroom the elevator was slower than molasses
on the plus side the room came with some decent sports channels every booth table in the alwaysempty bar had its own personal tv and its very handily placed for some nice sports bar and restaurants in the area if you are going out locally leave the car at the hotel parking after dark can involve a walk depending on where your room is",3.0
how the mighty have fallen,stayed at the homewood suites 1022  24 2012 i was given my room keys on the evening of the 22nd got to my room and found that neither key worked unfortunately i had all my luggage with me so i went to the service phone and told them about it the woman that had given me my keys said she would be right there after waiting 20 minutes i called backshe said that she got busy and would be there shortlyin 15 minutes i called again and she said oh im sorry i will be right there this time she actually came running so i said what about my keys they dont work she said i will take them and activate them and slip them under your door well i fell asleep waiting for her to return as i had a rough day it was about to get rougher at about 1130 pm a guy came in the front door of my room and said he was pretty certain that this was his room i was groggy and must have appeared miffed and i was he said im going to leave and go to the front desk i said uh yeah shortly i was called and told that i had the wrong room and that this guys stuff was in the room closet i checked and sure enough it was unbelieveable i kept the sheet that showed she had given me room 229 and i saw the sheet that he had that also said 229 i understand errors but this type of error could cause bodily harm my previous stay there i came into the room and noted that it smelled bad in the room i looked around and found that the kitchen sink had backed up and overflowed in the kitchen they said they didnt have another room and they could send maint in tomorrow wow in neither case did anyone say anything to try and make these problems right no future discounts no free bottle of water no kewpie doll nothing did get an i am sorry from the lady who gave two of us the same room but that was it i had been going to this particular homewood for so long that i went ahead and tried to make reservations again for my monthly trip to indianapolis and they didnt have my credit card on filethey did have someone elses card on my file that was the end for me,1.0
pleasant hotel but terrible internet service,this is a fairly old looking at least property on one side of the seattle center near the space needle pluses very pleasant front desk staff clean and goodsized rooms good location issues i could not get the wifi supposedly free and available throughout the hotel to work at all in the 2 days i was there i reported this to the front desk staff who promised to contact the it people but the situation never improved even in the business center the computers were slow and i finally gave up note to travelers with families the breakfast served is only about as good as the free breakfasts i have in most hotels but there is a charge for it 795 plus tax and presumably a modest tip not worth it in my opinion  the second day i had a muffin in my room purchased while out the first day there is a microwave and refrigerator in the rooms location is excellent for seeing the seattle center its not an area i as a single woman would feel comfortable walking back to alone at night though unlike hotels on the other side of the seattle center so some pluses and some minuses  just be aware,3.0
star ratings may mean nothing,this is place is masquerading as a luxury hotel it has a large lobby with large murals shiny surfaces marble bathrooms etc yet nothing is really well made or well designed in our room granted very large the remotes needed batteries the upholstery on the sofa was some kind of plasticized fabric that made noise whenever you shifted your weight the floor tiles and counters in the bathroom were cracked and had multiple repairs the breakfast was an absolute joke there were four boxes of cereal and some cellophane wrapped muffins,2.0
pretty good,"this hotel is well located near time square but as a result it is pricey even on priceline it came in at over 240 a night
rooms are functional and have all the necessities i have to say they are small but aparently most rooms in new york hotels are either way it was a comfortable room the service was good and the staff helpful 
as the location is very central it is very busy and noisy around the hotel time square is busy at all hours so consider this as most outdoor noise can be heard from the hotel",3.0
great location,i love the location of the hotel in the middle of all the stores and great if you are going to use public transportation right next to the bart station that can be taken right from the san francisco airport the rooms are on the very small size but if used only to sleep and shower it is great,3.0
hard rock chicago really rocks,what a place this is my wife and i stayed there for valentines day last year and had a wonferful time the rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are very comfortable the hotel provides a bathrobe to slip into  unwind after a long day of fun in the windy city the flat panel tv is a plus right along w the dvd player and the surround system in the room loved the lighting in the room because you can keep it dark  romantic or just turn on the lights for some reading the lobby itself was a fun place for the ambiance  music very modern hotel within a landmark building great michigan avenue location close to shopping dining theaters river tours and about 5 minutes away from navy pier really consider this place next time you stay in chicago,5.0
not too great but not horrible,didnt spend any time in this room except for sleeping the towels are very rough a little itty bitty coffee pot decent iron good blow dryer,3.0
bring your own toiletries,i read the reviews before booking being a hilton diamond member i had certain expectations which this hotel did not deliver besides that they are in a middle of renovations the whole hotel was upside downcalling front deskhalf hour on hold going to breakfast half hour waiting for a tableparking fees are outrageous at least five times greater than other hilton hotels very dissapointed,2.0
ok if it were half  the cost,"stayed here for 4 nights as other guest mentioned its still covered in scaffolding but even if it were not i cant help but feel the picture is an artist impresion of the hotel in a differant location the hotel iswas nice but it is very tired and the rooms and bar area quite simply need re decorating  service and staff were good the cost was totaly unjustified  small bottle of beer or coffee 10bucks  tax  tip about 3x what iy should be for a coffee 2x what it should be for beer
food was about 3x what it should be so if you stay here make sure you have a good credit limit on your card ",3.0
lovely room great location,"stayed at the metropolitan from 2226 jan 2005 during the blizzard cold and fed up after long difficult journey arrived at the doubletree metropolitan to be presented with a warm cookie each  delicious and very welcome i loved the room  the bed was so comfortable and the decor was nice good tv and shower and the room was well heated to just about the right temperature
i was worried about staying there after reading reviews on this site but i was completely satisfied with my stay and the location is excellent and like some other reviewers i can wholeheartedly recommend the oxford diner for breakfast  good food and very friendly service sets you up for the days sightseeing",4.0
hip and happening ace ticks all the boxes,i visited the ace hotel whilst in new york and was pleasantly surprised to find this was a trendy hang out for the upwardly mobile and the cool visually this boutique hotel has thought of everything huge comfy settees to sit and sip coffee a long table for the lap top fanatics to take root and lively buzz underpins the dimly lit foyer i didnt stay the night but wanted to it has the old world feel of the dorchester hotel london and the cutting edge decor that lets you know youve arrived will definitely book a room the next time i am in new york cant wait 2012 here i come,5.0
the right location at the right price,"what more could one ask for well maybe a few improvements that would make me want to stay here again
at checkin some minor issues there were 2 errors in my reservation name and length of stayseems like this data is critical and should be correct  a photocopy of my printed reservation was made so you wont be charged twice  and i had asked for a high floor and extra pillows neither of which i received the desk assured me pillows would be sent up they werent be warned that if you are on the 2nd floor as i was you will not have time to swipe your roomelev card before the elevator has passed your floor and you will accompany other guests to their floors 
the room was lovely the bedding crisp and clean the blinds shut out the morning light the hallway doors did not slam and i was able to sleep comfortably a complimentary new york times was enjoyed over coffee and croissant at a delicafe around the corner and my bags were gladly held for several hours after check out  i enjoyed a significant discount at the nearest garage with my validated parking stub and i found all the staff to be friendly especially if i said good morning first
fashion magazines in the room would link some fashion to the fashion26 hotel 
as a native manhattanite i chose this hotel for location and price only i was pleasantly surprised that there was room to walk around the bed there were plenty of towels and a coffee maker with capsules and nondairy creamers were supplied my room 208 had no bathtub and a narrow shower
i have stayed in many nyc hotels deluxe and funky  to suit the occasion  so the fashion26 worked well for me on this trip there is nothing outstanding about this hotel in a neighborhood of many choices i would stay here again if it were the right location at the right price",3.0

great place to stay for a dbacks game,stayed here one night for a dbacks game a very safe five minute walk to the light rail system very clean by the way that drops you off right at the stadium room price was reasonable with free parking location and room were clean and breakfast was fine for a continental offering intend on staying here when i return front desk staff were friendly and genuinely interested in helping you see the city,4.0
great hotel very chic  fun,"very nice stay overall stayed there on an almost sold out weekend of 62808 for one night as a plat member was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin which is more spacious got an extra window balcony to sit on however was travelling with friends so i requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead no problems
lobby the staffs were friendly and efficient the lobby is very hipchic just like what you would expect at the typical w hotel i like the hotel ambience espcially at night so pretty youll see many people hanging out at the lobby xyz bars at night time theres a dj there too theres an acura mdx experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an oneway ride to most of the places in sf area except airport of course and we did take advantage of it during our stay the drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus but due to the popular demand i recommend reserve your time spot early
the gym very nice with complete sets of eplical machines weights and the swim pool jacuzzi is right outside of the gym which is very hip looking too the gym opens 247 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm bliss spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their manipedicure and other services but i did not get to try it out so i am not going to commend on that
the room some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation so for those who hates siren at night you should request a room away from the firestation good ac very quiet and the lights in the room are very nice too the bed is the typical w bed not as heavenly as the westin heavenly bed but certainly better than sheraton sweet sleeper and other competitors bed i actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after i stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep that tells you how much i like their bedding the room is towards the small size 300 sq ft but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff the shower pressure is good not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean toiletries is the standard bliss sinkside 6 lemon sage scent which is one of my favorite hotel product one thing the bathroom door has no lock and its very clearsee thru so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it this is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey its w so you need to be more open minded about it turndown service available on request every evening
parking 42night 12 off if you drive a hybrid since its sf i did not drive its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isnt it also internet wifi are free at the lobby so youll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day
overall this is a good well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more freshier look instead of the dark depressing color some people liked it some dont of course the price can be high for most people at least 200night but if you want to have fun meet people or just want to enjoy the w scene you should give this property a try dont stay there if you want a quiet weekend getaway w is all about fun d",5.0
convenient to university city,a one night business trip found the hotel convenient right off i85 and my meeting at uncc was nearby new style kingbed room was kind of wierd has new furniture with an integrated pull out desk dresser and closet along the one wall made the room seem smaller then a standard courtyard room used to be the old closet area was converted to a coffee area not sure why closet seemed to be better there no more wallmounted hair dryer had to search for it in a dresser drawer buffet breakfast in the morning was standard and not memorable at all including the service no bike in the fitness center was missed also,3.0
many more pluses than minuses,"hotel staff was quite friendly helpful and attentive the correct room was available on our arrival and the room seemed clean bright and well appointed it was also a fairly spacious room even though it was close to the elevator the room was quiet my father my brother and i shared a room with two doubles felt like queensize and a pullout couch
the room has a small wet bar which includes a sink a refrigerator a microwave stored underneath oddly and a twocup coffee maker which was inoperative on our arrival but quickly replaced the thermostat is near the window in the pulloutcouch room and had to be turned up to nearly 80f to achieve a comfortable temperature  a designinstallation flaw the maintenance person assured me also between the two rooms are double doors with ball catches at the top one door did not have this catch  maintenance informed me they did not have the part to fix it not a huge deal but a little odd
the only somewhat major drawback was my brother reported as have others that the pullout was very uncomfortable i cannot personally report on it as i did not sleep there hey i was paying for the room i was sleeping in a real bed the doubles were really quite comfortable on the other hand wired internet didnt seem to work the modem had been unplugged from power but even plugged in it wouldnt connect wifiinternet access wasnt free anyway at a downtown hilton in a major city having to pay for internet access is unreasonable on the plus side i discovered the 4glte signal was powerful and the onetime lowcost tethering program works well
another very overthetop expense was parking we had taken a cab to the hotel but when family came to visit they found there is no nearby parking and the valet costs 3500 for between 26 hours i think it was 2700 for 02 hours and something like 50 for beyond 6 hours the family lives in town and said the cost was beyond the pale
returning to the positives there is an unsurprisingly expensive coffee shop which has a few snacks and serves starbucks coffees there is also a restaurant which i will review here as well which is really quite good",4.0

make sure have a printout of your confirmation,the hotel didnt look like much but the rooms were clean we had 3 rooms and one of the bathrooms was missing a shower curtain the pool was great and the shuttle service was too the only problem i had was at checkin i had prepaid and the man at the desk told me that i had only paid for 1 person per room i insisted that i had paid for 4 people per room and he argued with me i was able to show him my confirmation with proof that i had paid for 12 peopleeven though i only had 10 then he told me that the teenagers that were with me werent under the age of 17 he finally let it go but without proof he would of charged me more money,3.0
nice hotel but beware,we moved my daughter into her housing at umd college park and decided to take an extra day and spend the night in fells point as wed been there before and enjoyed it quite a bit we honestly werent totally sure about this hotel based on some of the reviews posted here but we went with it based on the location upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by the staff and the look of the lobby our room was clean and the bed was comfortable we had a great night out and enjoyed berthas mussels and gelato for dessert the cost of the room was reasonable and we had a great parking spot on the street the rub that i have is this when we received our bill at checkout there was adestination charge of 995 when we questioned the charge at the front desk we were told that that charge was imposed by the hotel and was not a city or state tax it was to cover the telephone in the room and the use of the lobby i dont know how many people use the phones in hotels anymore  we dont as to the use of the lobby we just walked through it im not totally sure how a lobby wold be used i told the clerk they should just raid the rate by 10 rather than be deceptive he had nothing to say i would have rated this hotel higher but really feel like we were decieved by the posted rate,3.0
we so had a great time great staff,your front desk staff are so on it i have been with starwood for 20 years we use to stay at the denver westin but no longer  because the staff at your hotel blows away there staffwestin they could use some training from your staff  excellent staff my family stays at your hotel several times a year and thay all say nothing but great things westin not so much short note  i was there foe the u2 concert and your room servicelate nite was slammed but the gentleman that delivered us room sevice was excellent  thank you for a great stay laurie alire,5.0
had a great time in indy,"the canterbury is a very nice hotel in the heart of indy i am not used to staying at boutique hotels so things like a doorman having ice brought to your room instead of getting it out of a machine and valet parking were all new to me that being said i enjoyed my stay immensely
the hotel is located in the heart of indy and is walking distance to just about anything you would want to see in downtown our room was well appointed and quite comfortable with plenty of room to relax the staff is all top notch and very willing to take care of your needs
there are a couple of items that indicate that this property is not as outstanding as a true 5 star should be the first is when the lobby was being used for a wedding notices were taped to the elevator wall with a piece of scotch tape imo a true 5star would have a frame of some kind to display the notice second the property is festooned with art and several of the pieces were identified with an avery folder label stuck either to the art itself or just below it lastly keep in mind that this is an older property and the walls are quite thin these are nit picks and did not detract from our enjoyment they are merely presented so you can make an informed decision
i would recommend the canterbury if you are visiting indy and want to stay in a very nice place with a great staff in the heart of a vibrant city",4.0
not completely upgraded yet  and beware the standard rooms,"this hotel is very conveniently located and has had some excellent upgrading done in the past few years but the air conditioning system is still old and very noisy this is now in sharp contrast to the modern furniture and beautiful bathrooms 
a second issue is the standard rooms which should be renamed standing rooms we were put in a standard room first and barely managed to squeeze past the bed to the bathroom for single occupancy when on a business trip this is perhaps ok but for a couple it is cramped and claustrophobic the hotel had changed ownership  we booked at the lola hotel and their room bookings had different names  and we distinctly remembered booking a larger room than the standard and the hotel staff kindly put us in a larger room the second night however when reading through other reviews it seems the policy is to put unsuspecting guests in the standard room for the first night and then upgrade them on the second night 
another issue that others have remarked upon some rooms seem to be rented out permanently and people may smoke in these rooms  our standard room was nonsmoking but smoke filtered through somehow from somewhere the second larger room we had was smoke free  and the noise of the air conditioning was less bothersome as the room was larger but in both rooms it was difficult to sleep through the noise of the ac 
if they do something about the smoke and if they upgrade the ac system and if they dont rent out the standard rooms to couples they would have a winning proposition",3.0
do yourself a favorstay somewhere else,service is nonexistent and the rooms are very small the staff was unable to do simple tasks like bring pillows or provide the items offered on the menu the coffee they have outside the guest rooms was very good but not worth the lack of hospitality,1.0
grrreat hotel,stayed in this hotel in january 2007 and can say no bad things about it the hotel staff were extremly friendly and catered to all our needs and sorted any problems and queries we had quickly and efficiently the rooms were a reasonable size and as you dont go to new york to stay in your hotel was more than adequate the rooms were always spotless with fresh linen and towels everyday the bathrooms were lovely with a great shower with round the clock hot water all in all the washington jefferson was a great experience in an excellent location only 5 minutes from time square highly recommended,5.0
thankful for an uncleaned room,if you can afford it get the king executive we were booked in a queen deluxe on the 7th floor which was dark cramped dingy and felt its age fortunately it wasnt cleaned nor was it clean 5 hours later when we returned so we were graciously moved to a lovely king executive on the 3rd floor 2 windows lovely view to the garden spacious i get that old hotels have character and history instead of level floors and big rooms but its the lack of value here i object to i shopped a lot of hotels and paid extra but was sorely disappointed with our original room with the upgrade perfect otherwise nice staff good coffee great locationmaybe with the book theme they could have a shelf of borrowable books  old paperbacks down in the lobbyjust a thought,3.0
fantastic locationvery happy we are staying again,"my husband and i stayed at the novotel times square in 2010 i couldnt select the earlier date when submitting this review and we loved it the location was absolutely perfect and so close to times square we really enjoyed having a drink at the end of the day out on the balcony and enjoying the view
yes the rooms are a little small but isnt most in ny what more do you need when you are there to explore the magnificent city and not to sit in your room all day worrying about silly things starbucks just over the road for coffee and wifiperfect
we enjoyed it so much we have now booked in again for our second trip to ny next year in march and hear renovations are about to start i hope we will enjoy it just as much as last time thank you",5.0

nice looking place  horrible service,"the hotel was beautiful and the location was great our room was very nice however the service was terrible
we were travelling with a baby and informed the hotel before we arrived that we would be needing a crib 2 hours and 4 calls to the front desk later they finally brought it up
the concierge gave us the wrong directions on two different occasions 
the valets always kept us waiting on our car even after calling from our room at least 15 minutes before we needed to leave
checkout was awful we called the front desk and asked for someone to help us with our bags before we went down to check out their express checkout took 15 minutes and it was another 30 minutes before our bags made it down
we have stayed at other intercontinentals before and have never had any problems this was by far one of our worst experiences with service at a hotel ive had better service at a holiday inn",2.0
what a little gem of a boutique hotel,just wanted to let fellow travelers know what a wonderful time my wife  i had at this quaint centrally located boutique hotel this past weekend really a charming little hotel had no idea it was the original hilton in 1925 until we got there we loved the bright and airy décor in the rooms and lobby and all of the staff was friendly professional and simply added to the entire ambiance of the place my wife and i have decided that although we live only in bedford about 25 miles away we are going to make every effort to come back and have a staycation about every 3 months for a little getaway,5.0
short stay perfect fit,i spent one night at the monaco and it was too short a stay the location was perfect for me close to the theatres i had a tall room which was fun think tall ceilings extratall robe plus regular sized robe only problem i had was to adjust the shower headi needed to climb on the side of the tub to reach it however the staff was very accommodating and im sure someone would have helped me had i asked loved the lavender chocolate for my pillow too,5.0
disappointed and frustrated,i booked this hotel for my stay in fort worth for 3 nights thru hotelscom my room was nice enough i had the jacuzzi suite room after a long drive i was looking forward to the jacuzzi i filled up the tub got in and hit the button for the jets and nothing happened i complained the next morning and was told that that room isnt reserved very often and the master switch hadnt been turned on later that day i filled up the tub again got in and hit the button for the jets and once againnothing i didnt bother to complain the other complaint i had was the wifi connection popped off more than it stayed on when i had complained about that i was told that if there are lots of people trying to be on it it does have a tendency to kick off sure didnt look like hotel was very busy so that didnt make sense the other reason i was given for the internet connection not staying connected was that someone might have a virus on their computer and the resources were being used up causing the connection to pop off needless to say i would not recommend this hotel and will not return to this hotel should i ever be in fort worth in the future,3.0
worst hotel ever do not stay here youll regret it,as soon as we checked in we knew something was wrong there were cameras every where felt like a prison and we were all being closely monitored there were stains all over sheets yuck then the staff decides to change the locks on the door in the middle of our stay 3 different men literally came in with a saw and hammer and changed the lock for what seemed like an eternity as we sat there awkwardly on the beds creepiest thing ever then during check out we were charged extra for having people over the hotel manager was a total nazi and i say that in the kindest way possible he charged us 200 for one night ive never heard of a hotel charging gor visitors we complained about the lock situation and how rude that was but he didnt care no refunds he told us we need to check our souls but we think he needs to check his reviews on this and other trip review sites hes terrible and so is his filthy hotel,1.0
not the worst but not the best,just wanted to throw a flag for the extremely small rooms even for ny this was exceptionally small the decor is nice the cleanliness was average the location is good if you want to be on times squarebut the shock of the closetsized room was enough to ruin it for me also they have the tiniest elevators ever so small and so slowmakes it annoying to go in and out,3.0
ringing in the new year,"my boyfriend and i stayed at the hyatt on new years eve 2011 we had stayed once before and we absolutely loved it so we decided to ring in the new year there we found out that the hotel has a new years bash on their top floor for around 100 a person we hadnt reserved our tickets so we missed out on the party but we found out the hotels downstairs lounge has one as well and it was free they played great music they also serve dinner or appetizers if you arrive early enough to score a table we ended up there and we had a wonderful time we ended up getting engaged that night it was a great night we love it so much that well be ringing in 2012 at the hyatt again this year  
the hotel staff is wonderful and the hotel lobby is very nice check in and check out was hassle free the view from our room was amazing they have a very nice pool which we havent been able to use because we always stay in january they have a fire pit which you can enjoy a nice bottle of wine at the hotel is walking distance to the downtown bars and shops we love the manchester hyatt its one of our favorite places to stay in the gaslamp district",5.0

a great base of operations,located just a few blocks from the heart of time square this hotel is reasonably priced for the area at 159 a night we were pleased to find that we were right in the middle of the action just a few blocks from broadway and there is a ny sight seeing bus stop right outside the door the concierge desk was okay not great the rooms are plain approaching bare bones but if you are looking for somewhere that is clean affordable and spacious enough that you can stretch out a bit then look no further the hotel was undergoing some serious renovations while we were there so it may be getting a major face lift we were happy with our stay and would return if we could get the room for the same price,4.0

the greatest hotel in nyc ,"the lobby is incredible simple clean lines and very light
the room i got was a single with a shared bath i stayed overnight but just wanted a place to crash the room was brand new it had a flat screen tv sinkmirror easy to use free wifi phone the bed was comfy and the room was bright and cheery were the rooms big heck no but who cares i only need a clean place to sleep
the shared bathrooms were very nice there were 5 individual bathrooms had toilet sink and shower on my floor each one is completely seperate from the others with its own entrance so you are not sharing your experience with others
the staff was very welcoming and attentive the one desk clerk said that they were originally going to just repaint everything but he said they ended up redoing everything down to the wiring

not bad  not great,had to stay here since my regular hotel was sold out i am not a picky traveler overall the room was nice and clean i did get the sense that the hotel was a bit on the tired side but overall it served it purpose of providing a place to sleep for the night i utilized the shutttle service to and from the office and to the and from a local restaurant this was a nice touch would i stay here again i would if i was not able to get into my regular hotel that i prefer,4.0
great location comfortable rooms,"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency for a few nights in may you couldnt ask for a better location its adjacent to the convention center and within walking distance of shopping and museums 
the room was on the large side and i felt the bed was comfortable there wasnt a minibar in the room which always disapoints me when that happens but thats life 
i was put on the 27th floor which is on the same floor as a bar this caused me some issues as drunken guests would yell in the hallways and keep me up i dont recommend staying on the 27th floor if you stay here that is unless you wish to join the drunkards which could make it fun
i would stay here again if i were to come back to denver but i would avoid the 27th floor",4.0

so pleasantly surprised,"we had traveled up to ucla medical center for a family medical emergency to support our family about midnight all of the children were fading fast and i quickly searched for a local holiday inn to book rooms the desk clerk was wonderful and we were able to get the internet rate by phone a definite plus
the hotel was only one exit from the hospital and was right off the freeway from the north side just go past the intersection and turn into the parking 
we checked in at 1 am and were offered late checkout should we need it we didnt but it was nice the rooms were on the small side but completely functional with fridge coffee maker and individual climate controls everything was clean and in order the beds were so comfortable we fell asleep quickly only one of our entire group found the street traffic made it difficult to sleep 
the extended continental breakfast was a bonus not gourmet but good and hot and started our day out great the cinnamon rolls were fabulous though they had free coffee and tea in the lobby as well
the neighborhood wasnt great and the hotel seemed out of place but we sure were glad it was there
we did note that several local restaurants offered delivery for dinner 
our oldest wants to attend ucla so we will probably be returning to this hotel in the next year or so

the four seasons boston is the best hotel experience ive ever had in any city in any country really,ive never written a tripadvisor review but then i wasnt expecting the four seasons boston to be the best hotel ive ever stayed in the location the service the food the pool area on the roofi loved it all i only wish i couldve stayed longer i would have eaten more french fries they were sublime and i dont particularly like french fries,5.0
great hotel poor location,"my friends and i booked two rooms off priceline for 65 per night i thought this was a great deal for the warwick rooms were spacious and pleasantly cleaned the bathrooms looked updated as well 
the rooftop pool had amazing views but the pool itself and lounge chairs were extremely basic considering we spent the day rock climbing the pool did its service in helping us relax 
for the cons  location location location the downtown vibe seems to be around market st and 16th st mall the hotel is a very lengthy walk to these areas and i found myself walking next to sleeping homeless people at night so if you dont mind the distance i would recommend staying at the hotel but have some sort of transportation readily available",4.0
spacious central location for visit,there are many good posts for this location a forum post recommended hotelrescom for san francisco hotel deals and i want to emphasize that here we got a very good deal from the site when the hotel site said it was fully booked we had a king room with a sofa bed that was perfect for a family of 4,4.0
a fine hotel in a super location,the staybridge suites in times square is a lovely hotel that is equidistant from lower manhattan and the upper east and west sides for those who are looking to stay on or near times square this is a great choice our room was of a goodsize with nice amenities including refrigeratorfreezer stove microwave kitchen utensils and a wellappointed bathroom rates included a free happy hour every early evening with beer wine and munchies as well as a fabulous buffet breakfast each morning though no rates are cheap for new york hotels the abovementioned amenities must be factored into the price as their being included would add a hefty sum in a different hotel the only small gripe i might mention is that when serving breakfast in the large chafing dishes each morning the eggs bacon etc have gotten lukewarm or cool after a short while this might be remedied by having a source of heat under each large chafing dish similar to the stern that is put under fondue pots other than this small item i can find nothing to complain about with the nice room and friendly staff oh yes the nice large flatscreen tv plus various free newspapers each morning are a welcome treat,5.0

a perfect bargain,this hotel is well worth the price located perfectly on lexington avenue we were just blocks from everything the chrysler building is four blocks away and times square is about six the rooms were spacious considering space constraints and very clean the people working in the office were more than helpful whether they were bringing your bags to your room for you or recommending a good place to eat this hotel offered more than some fivestar chains ever would and i would absolutely stay again,4.0
good value for the money,close enough to san diego to be downtown in under 20 minutes but its suburban setting meant better prices at local restaurants and no tourist traps plus the pool wasnt crowded the room was comfortable and had a microwave and wet bar i was disappointed that the rate did not include a fridge but one can be rented from the front desk one caution the hotels brochure says the breakfast buffet is complimentary but they tried charging 995 per person theres better food for less money at area eateries,4.0

the lobby and other common areas are works of art but this is one of the older hotels that does not disappoint when you get upstairs you feel like you have stepped back in time but never lack for modern conveniences and comforts the beds and linens are comparable to any top property we have consistently gotten truly fabulous suites for the price of a standard room elsewhere the service is amazing and we have never been disappointed by anything at this property including the restaurants bar and room service while we have stayed at other properties in new york for a variety of reasons we will return to the waldorf time and time again and next time if we need to be in another area of town we will just take a cab",5.0
my kinda hotel before heading down route 66,"we arrived very late at night after a 9 hour delay flying over from uk and we received a warm reception on arrival our request was for a twintwinsofabed room high up with a front facing view we were on the 21st floor but none of these rooms face the front  we could just see the tops of the sears tower ariels sticking above the other nearby towers
we ate out for all our meals including breakfast  tip of the day is turn left towards the michican avenue and not right towards the lake otherwise youll be hungry there is an amazing mcdonalds a few blocks west  huge fancy thing unlike any other you will see in the world  it a special to mark their 50th anniversary and worth a visit
everywhere you will want to see downtown is within walking distance so we didnt hire our car until time to drive route 66 the hotel has an integrated public mutlistorey car park and you get a much reduced rate for staying at the hotel
the kids  i appreciated the free high speed internet service  two pcs you can use so dont worry if you forget your laptop like i did
nice lounge bar and a few tables on the pavement outside or side walk as you call it in the us nice califonian red by the glass though i cant remember the label not many sidewalk cafes in chicago shame
friendly staff including some brits fresh fruit at reception and one day we even had free miniature hersey bars though i still dont like them it aint chocolate
our family party of 5 managed to share the single bathroom we enjoyed our 3 night stay here and would recommend this hotel",5.0
excellent hotel for first time philly experience,"wow this place exceed my expectations i read the great reviews on trip advisor and knew this place must be special it was this was our wife first time in philadelphia and we couldnt have picked a better place we were in walking distances from major historical areas south street and amazing whole in the wall cafes and restaurants we stayed for two days and had an amazing time the rooms were small but cozy all those reviewers not giving this place a rates because their rooms are small or they dont have a parking lot on premises fail to understand this building is historic and was built during the time where a large rooms were not the norm and cars where not around however they provide a discounted parking rate a couple small blocks away also the rooms are super clean and the small size did not bother us moreover the staff was super friendly the manager was so helpful and suggested an amazing breakfast joint a few blocks away that is now on my top list of amazing breakfast places thanks 
overall this place was amazing",5.0
beautiful renovation but then theres,"ive used priceline before to book hotels for seattle but in this instance and like all others i wanted something right downtown close to everything while the renaissance is considered downtown its kinda a reach to say so its right on the end and literally right on the highway so if youre hoping to do a little shopping downtown expect to either cab it back to the hotel or walk quite a few blocks with bags in your hands
the hotel has been renovated beautifully the lobby is gorgeous even the rooms have been renovated nicelybut theres one thing i wouldnt have thought of prior to staying here and that ive never ever experienced in a hotel in seattle before
the building is built on springsi believe for the sake of earthquakes etc which isnt a problem other than you will hear the ear piercing and constant sound of the building swaying and screeching throughout the night with the same rhythm as the wind 
after trying to figure out this noise for about 3 hourswe finally called the front desk and they explained all of the above of course there isnt much they can do about the construction of the building which is understandible but she kindly offered us earplugs which we used and finally slept through the remainder of the evening this also helped drown out the noise of the highway traffic
on a positive note there are some great restaurants within a nice walk from the hotel we enjoyed a beautiful dinner at elliots on the pier and were able to walk there
the staff were quite nice the security out front was more than accomodating and offered us directions and an umbrella
its a nice hotel that they are definately doing their best with it but it is older and the location didnt fit our needs this time around but for quick accomodations right off the highway on a not so windy day may be worth it",3.0
great locationat the right price,"needed a place to stay for one evening while dropping my son at
school in dc booked on priceline the evening before for 75 bargain room on tenth floor  king bedvery comfortable
bath was updated and clean tv was a little olderbut worked
i had dinner late on sunday at the restaurant off the lobby and
yes it was not cheaphowever the food was good and service
excellent park in the public lot which is directly across the street
no worries about 25 per day you do not need a car to travel around the city as the public transportation system is very good
lobby is clean plenty of police around the area if you can
get this hotel for 200 or belowtake the deal",4.0
great place  great location,"i just returned from another visit to nyc and once again stayed at the
time having worked in the city i like their central location the time is a boutique hotel and to me therein is the difference 
i find the staff there courteous and pleasant and committed to providing service unlike the larger chain hotels here you are treated as a special guest whether its your first time there or a returning guest along with a great staff the rooms are clean quiet and secure  what else is there 
they are in the process of opening a new restaurant serafina that offers gourmet pizza if there is one thing i love about nyc it is their pizza
ps i am not associated with nor do i know anyone at this hotel outside of being a guest there",5.0
clean comfortable convenient friendly great location,"not enough great things to say about this hotel i was quite impressed with the perfectly clean white linens and the overall cleanliness of the suite and the hotel itself attractive decor inside and out comfortable kingsize bed with lots of space in the room comfortable sitting area in the suite inroom fridge microwave coffee maker cable tv nice big windows good breakfast selection
the friendly staff greeted us by name whenever they saw us they were very informative and knowledgable 
hotel is a short drive from the airport shopping malls downtown and business areas",5.0
great location and value,i live in the boston area but stayed here for a night out with girlfriends the back bay location could not be beat the hotel is right next door to the back bay t station and within easy walking distance to both newbury st and the south end the rooms were average size with basic accommodations but were very clean we had a small problem with our first room and the front desk immediately switched and upgraded our room great room and hotel at a really great price,4.0
good hotel and service avoid third floor,this is a good hotel and great service we arrived late the first night where planning to sleep in until 10am but at 7am we started to hear a lot of person traffic talking and standing by our door for our surprise the third floor you have a guest room and two rooms who have been converted to a conference room we requested a room change which the front desk found us one with the same harbor view provided us with some refreshment and snacks for the night,4.0
classy,"the huntington is a quiet comfortable classy hotel the room was very very spacious for a hotel of this age and also for the city other than following the curious hotel trend of no qtips or cotton balls in the bathroomunless requested
an enjoyable perfect stay well i got my qtips on day one and a mountain of them were graciously delivered by housekeeping and carefully laid on a clean tissue within minutes of asking  
heres the short list of good things loccitane bath products deep soaking tub viewalicious pool killer manhattan martini nice old school restaurant quiet location sweet doormen and lobby staff a very nice spa shop with great product selection fast and delicious room service super comfortable friendly non intrusive vibe you wont see or hear the staff other than in the lobbyspa etc which is nice",5.0
great hotel for midprice range,"my five star rating is based on the price range im basically comparing it to 3 star hotels 
this laquinta was very clean i was shocked to find out that it was over five years old the rooms were comfortable and quiet
the manager was checking the kitchen each morning and even doing some room service i suspect that the commitment of the manager is one reason this hotel is in such great shape
overall theres not much to do in the surrounding area but if you are working nearby this hotel is a great place to stay",5.0
good for low budget,"if you want a low budget hotel in ny this will serve your purpose well spent 2nights here and didnt have any problems booked a room with shared bathroom but never bumped into any one at all during my stay nice situation 5mins from central park 1min from subway station and easy access to bus stops
clean and friendly staff
not 5star hotel but excellent for the price as you only spend the night in your room anyway",4.0
beautiful resort hotel with loads of history,the omni shoreham is a welcome respite in a fast moving city and i would definitely recommend it in the summer months if you want a combination of a resort and a city hotel it was really nice to come back to this beautiful hotel and relax at the pool  which was incredible  complete with drink and food service and a 24 hour fitness center we booked two rooms one a suite and the hotel accommodated us nicely placing the rooms next to each other we did enjoy our stay  even though we had the misfortune of being there two nights when fire alarms went off the week prior to 4th of july being an omni select member i expressed my dissatisfaction and insisted that i would only be happy if fully compensated for the nights that were interrupted by the alarms i know others reviewed this hotel and were very unhappy with the fire alarm situation but to tell you the truth the hotel did deal with it well  in my situation  maybe becausei was more assertive in expressing what i expected of them thus i am still rating the omni 5 stars and i hope the they have corrected the faulty alarm system so that no one has to experience being evacuated without just cause in summary i would give this advice to my fellow travelers if you are at all dissatisfied with a stay be professional and polite and express yourself if you dont get the answer you are looking for make sure you are dealing with the manager if you still dont get the answer you are looking for write to a manager in the corporate office that usually works especially if you are a frequent guest of that particular hotel chain,5.0
nice room poor breakfast and apathetic staff,"i love to go to philadelphia  and i go at least once or twice a year i always stay at this comfort inn love the location rooms are very clean and pretty spacious with a good breakfast
this time i stayed in room 921 which was right next to the elevator i was initially concerned about the noise but was very pleasantly surprised that i didnt hear the elevator even once the room was very nice  air conditioning worked well great shower pressure in the shower one negative about the bathroom is the insane placement of the toilet paper spindle  very awkward
my only quibble this time was the breakfast quantity and the staff in the breakfast room first day when i asked politely about whether she was going to bring out bananas she very rudely told me that she had already done that once the second day the breakfsast room was filthy trash was full overflowing crumbs all over the counter empty cups that had held waffle batter on the counter tables sticky andor covered with crumbs plus there was very little food when we got there and had to wait for the same staff member to bring it out it was down to bran muffins and cold cereal no milk before she got off her cell phone to bring food out that part was very disappointing",4.0
old and dirty  nasty,"well where do i start first of all  it looks nothing like the pics i can not believe super 8 would let their name be used on this property
it was old dirty and nasty the bathroom looked like the 1940s there was something all over the lower part of the wall in the bathroomnot sure what it was the bathtub was stained we put bath towels down to stand on no trashbags in any of the trashcans cobwebs and dust everywhere towel racks in bathroom were rustymicrowave was blocked up on one side to make it level we chose not to have maid service because we did not want anyone in our roomwould i recommend this motelno way",1.0
clean small bathrooms need a revamp,we stayed here for 3 nights staff were friendly and hotel was clean room was on the small side but i expect that with city hotels however the bathroom was a bit of a let down old fashioned poorly decorated old and quirky are fine but this was just old breakfast was ok nothing fantastic juice cereal croissant coffee and some fresh fruit its position in sf good not far from powell st bart close to chinatown and shopping if you like that sort of thing had dinner the first night in finos effectively the hotel restaurant was very busy and food was good would recommend reserving a table if you plan to eat there on your first night,4.0
a little piece of heaven,"i spent the weekend here with my family and i couldnt have asked for more great location service and accommodations and a great value on the weekend
we had a club suite plus a king room for our family of four and the club lounge was amazing great patio with a view hit breakfast and evening snacks and cocktails
cant wait to return",5.0
well run friendly stylish good food whats not to like,well located in the floursihing meatpacking district the soho house is supremely comfy and easy place to stay the service is good and very friendly the public areas are stylish and relaxed and the food is great and like all soho house establishments the rooms are very well thought out and equipped its expensive but worth it,4.0
a fantastic hotel in the heart of downtown that maintains the standards we would all like to see,a great venue in this refurbished hotel in the heart of downtown i have stayed here twice and both times were excellent i have been accompanied on business trip and found everything i needed there is an adjacent parking garage which guests can use and valet service is available the communal areas are light and freindly breakfast was a great selection,5.0
perhaps because i lived in nyc i think park 79 is nice and reasonably priced,i have stayed at park79 twice both times while in town for business the rooms are small but clean with comfortable beds the walls are a bit thin but it is nyc i found the staff to be friendly and helpful you cannot beat the upper west side location if you are expecting luxury you are not going to find it in nyc for 109  189 per night if you are looking for a comfortable room in a great location this is a good deal,4.0
beyond excellent,we just spent our third stay at the willard i love this hotel the staff is extemely attentive and polite giving the impression that you are their only patron michael at the reception desk was one of the nicest hotel employees i have ever met he made sure we got a good room and that we were satisfied with all of the services what a delight our room was clean large and quiet fulfilling all of our needs this hotel is well worth the money and it is my only choice when visiting dc,5.0
the best hotel staff weve ever experienced,"what a magical place this hotel is its not fancy or luxurious but its clean bright the rooms are large and the staff is absolutely wonderful the hotel has a family feel to it although there were singles there as well the pool was great right in the middle of the courtyard and late in the afternoon a staff member comes and offers lemonade and popsicles to the people in and around the pool  free of charge upon arrival to magic castle the reception staff offer champagne flutes with lemonade in them breakfast is complimentary and quite adequate  cereals fruit pastries bread spreads coffee juice etc soft drinks and snacks are available at the front desk any time of day and are also complimentary
we could walk to hollywood blvd in 5 minutes where we visited graumanns theater the walk of fame the kodak theater and lots of interesting shops there is also a metro stop right there so you can take the subway wherever you need to go
what made the magic castle hotel so special to us was the staff on our second last day we found out that our pet cat weve had her 12 years was very ill and would probably pass away at any moment i informed the front desk staff that we would have to check out a day early and they were very understanding a few minutes after i had gone back to my room one of the staff knocked on the door and gave us a little card they had made for us saying they hoped our cat would be alright they also gave us a little stuffed mouse for her to play with
so to gretchen adam shawn and i think daphne thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality we will definitely return
and to anyone considering staying at the magic castle go for it
weve never experienced such helpful and friendly people as we did there
ps our cat is still hanging in but she doesnt have much time left but she was so happy to see us",5.0

do not stay at this hotel,"hotwire has this hotel in the category with hyatts and other 4star hotels this place is far from a 4star hotel this place cannot be compared to a hyatt westin crowne plazanot even a hamptom inn and suites 
the description of a boutique hotel couldnt be further from the truth the carpeting through the halls needs to be replaced there is mold and mildew in the bathrooms  along with furniture that is chipping and needs to be replaced the furniture with the sink is chipping and warped the shower temperature control was loose and the handle falling off on a positive note theyve got great beds
1 know that you cannot use a luggage cart there on your own you must use a bellhop even if you want to do it yourselfand the bellhops are annoying and pushy
2 do not pay for a guaranteed room through hotwire the hotel knows nothing about this offer and wont refund your money when they dont have a king bedroom available like they didnt for us they will continue to give you the run around like they seem to do with everything see 4
3 the first room they gave us reeked of sewage so after carrying all our luggage wedding gifts stroller pack n play and my 13 week old to the 9th floor i had to go back downstairs and request another room
4 they dont just swipe your card for incidentals they actually put a hold on your account for 50 when i called to see why 50 was charged to my bank account they brushed me off and said it was a hold used for incidentals well someone should have explained that when i presented my credit card ive stayed at hyatts westins marriotts holiday inns hampton inn and suites crowne plazas sofitel intercontinental and tons of other hotels in the us and internationally and this is the first hotel that actually placed funds on holdthe explanation i was given by erwin  sp was that it was explained on the registration form i signed at checkin problem is i never signed a registration form at checkin jonathan the individual who checked us in never gave me a form to sign erwin transferred me to ashleywho passed the buck and transferred me to her accounting manager  laverne green  why not just apologize for any financial inconvenience ttheir customer service leaves something to be desired
5 parking   ridiculous 46nt for parking ive never paid this much for parking at any hotelnot in dc not in ny not in la not in honolulu not in london tokyo or madrid
the customer service overall was abysmal the staff acted like snoody people who really didnt care if their customers were happy or not the staff and management should be ashamed of their behavior
i always read these reviews and think this person is probably some yuppy who is only used to posh places well i am far from that heck ive stayed at comfort and red roof inns and been extremely happ im not someone who has to have the top of the line i really just like clean places with a friendly staff and if there is a problem i like for it to be handled 
this hotel was definitely a major disappointment i will never recommend this hotel to anyone this hotel literally ruined a weekend that was supposed to be a great trip back to hyatts and westins",1.0
this hotel is quite a find,this boutique hotel hasnt gotten the credit it deserves i just returned from a 3 night stay and it was great yes the rooms are small but plenty of space for 2 people maybe 3 the bathrooms are large nicely appointed and the toiletries are top notch the staff was very nice and helpful with one exception but there always is an exception i wouldnt let her bad attitude change my opinion of this quaint very clean and lovely hotel plus the beds are fabulous,4.0
classic and nice,"i absolutely love this hotel the rooms are classy and marble bathrooms are a nice touch one of my favorite things is eating in the windows lounge for some of the best people watching in los angeles 
a little overpriced but hey its the four seasons would definitely recommend",5.0
comfortable accommodations friendly staff in a great location,we enjoyed a weekend visit to new york city and the distrikt hotel was a perfect choice for us we arrived by train into penn station and were able to walk easily to the hotel on saturday we walked all over that part of town empire state bldg 5th ave bryant park and to dinner and theater that night the hotel staff was courteous  helpful and our room was very comfortable great bed  free wifi it is located next to a couple of other nice hotels which are a lot more expensive so it felt like a very good value thank you tripadvisor for your recommendation of this hotel,5.0
really great location quiet nights sleep great for a stay in nyc,i too was very apprehensive about the reviews about this hotel especialy comments about the staff  but cleaning staff porters doormen all great  a couple of the desk staff could have been much more smiley and responsive to visitors when checking in and out  but wasnt really a problem and if you walk right round the side of the block and walk 2 blocks over there is a fantastic cafe wine bar  italian with brilliant breakfasts and lovely lovely lovely staff who made us feel part of the cafe regulars i woudl recommend this hotel for brilliant central location and very quiet atmosphere,4.0
great location,we loved the location of this hotel just a short walk to all of the sights room was great with lovely shower and good quality toiletries bed was comfy and linens good quality liked the wooden floors as they felt cleaner than carpet cupcakes were good too,4.0
great location with boutique rooms,we stayed here to watch a detroit red wings game the hotel room was boutique aka small but very modern looking and comfortable it was nice just to walk to the people mover for the game the casino is very smoky so it was nice that the whole hotel is smoke free we had the breakfast buffet which was very good in the hotel staff were very friendly  i checked out but left my coat in the room one of the managers asked for the room number and where i left it and got my coat for me rather than wait in the long check out line the only think missing is a poolspa area but for the price of the room i would stay here instead of mgm or motorcity,5.0
magnolia hotel houston,we arrived late but in time for the milk and cookies buffet held every evening in the lounge an assortment of freshly baked cookies cold milk and coffee were available to all guests the guest rooms were surprisingly large and included every amenity a business traveler or social guest could need bathroom lighting could use an update the breakfast buffet was plentiful and included a selection of hot and cold foods a very positive experience all around,4.0
i like this hotel  would stay here again,hi  im a new yorker who currently does not live in the city but when im in the city i have strong preferences to stay downtown  particularly near the lower east side or the east village this hotel is about a year old pretty new with a strangely good location on ludlow street  very prime there is a nail salon across the street and a crepe place as well as all the other cool shopping mint julep right there the best gelato is just down the street il labratorio  and is not to be missed though the elevators were a lil slow what i liked best about the hotel was its smallness even if there rooms were a lil small but it just seemed easy to get in and out as though i lived there without being a huge hotel with a bunch of elevators bathroom was big room was small but view was okay do stay here,4.0
theres good news and theres bad news,"bottom line this is a very pleasant place to stay and was convenient for us since we were visiting the u of sd and sea world
the bad news
in general there was a bunch of little things that were kind of annoying for us we are two men in our 40s that rented 2 rooms a small one and a larger one the larger one had a kitchen and sofabed as well as a queen both nonsmoking
1 the first larger room they gave me had a strong cigarette smoke smell the carpet actually had cigarette burns in it in spite of the fact that this was supposed to be a nonsmoking room
2 i was transferred to another room no smoke smell but it and my friends room both had a perfumydisinfectant kind of smell that we both found unpleasant perhaps its that fabreze stuff and you might not mind it but both of us left the windows open to get rid of it the second room also had cigarette burns in it these were on the blanket in addition the back of the door to the room had some heavy scratches and dents on it as if something heavy had been thrown against it
3 when i returned later to my room and turned on the tap to brush my teeth there was an overpoweringly strong sulphur smell rotten eggs smell coming out of the tap
4 i went to buy bottled water and the vending machine i tried was out of water the second one stole my money and failed to dispense my water
5 when we arrived the pool had a sign on it saying that the water heater was broken although i saw people swimming in it later in the day who said it was warm
6 the make your own waffles for breakfast were pretty tastelss and the cereal had a stale taste the cereal was dispensed from large glass jars via scoops i thought it strange that the scoops were stored by hanging them by the scooppart not by the handle on the wooden knobs that were screwed into the center of the jar lids in this way every dirty hand that came in contact with a jar lid  and left its germs on the lids knob resulted in those germs being transferred to the scoop which in turn was repeatedly inserted into the jar yeech i believe that the reason the cereal tasted stale was that the jars were never emptied and washed  just refilled from time to time
7 the remarks of the prior posters notwithstanding there was some traffic noise from the street my room was about 12 way back from the driveway entrance and you could still hear some noise in the distance with the windows closed it didnt disturb me  i feel asleep easily but it might affect light sleepers especially if your room was closer to the street fyi the smaller rooms what they call the bungalows are farther away from the street than the larger rooms in general
ok the good news
1 the lobby was very nice  there was the fireplace and attractive furnishings 
2 checkin was a snap mary at reception who later changed my room was a delight as was everyone who worked there
3 the rooms were very nicely decorated even the smaller room was nice  the only slight drawback was the smaller rooms bath which had the original tile which while clean looked a little old
4 everyone who worked there was very helpful and kind when i lost my money in the soda machine the deskclerk led me to the third machine in the laundry room and gave me the money i had lost
5 the orange juice and tea at breakfast was tasty i did not try the bagels but they were large and lots of people appeared to be enjoying them
ive sinced talked to a plumber who told me that the sulpur smell that i experienced which was not in the shower btw could have resulted from a recent plumbing repair and probably would go away in a week or less
all in all id rate it 312 stars if that were possible the hotel was completely sold out both days we were there so im sure they had their hands full",3.0
great location,"front desk were very helpful they were able to give us lots of information about the area internet is available free to use on two shared computers next to the lobby breakfast was okay a bit plastic tasteless but complimentary good location 2 blocks back from fishermans wharf very easy walk and back far enough that you didnt have any noise or crowds tour desks close and end of cable car turnaround is only 2 blocks away everything was an easy walk and transport was easy to catch if you wanted to venture to down town or take a tour over the golden gate bridge
rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable you dont get a view from most rooms however you dont spend much time in your room anyway as there is so much to see in san fran if you want to do laundry you do need to use the coin operated machines in the next holiday inn which is in the same block the front desk can swap notes for quarters to use the machines",4.0
perfect location,stayed at the handlery for 5 nights and have nothing negative to say the staff was friendly the room was clean the location is absolutely perfect you got the cable car practically on your doorstep you can see union square from the front door all shops levis westfield gap uo ae and more best diners 3 loris diners within 5 minutes walk from the hotel all transport cable streetcar and bus on market st are within very short walking distance because of the ideal location i was able to walk around in the evening feeling safe if i was lucky enough to go back to sf for a 3rd time i would definitely book in the handlery again,5.0

a first class experience,the park hyatt is located just off north michigan avenue adjacent to the famous water tower abundant shopping and restaurants are close by and its only a short cab ride to the art institutethe hotel itself has been extensively refurbished with ample and tastefully decorated guest rooms it is a very efficient operation from the time one pulls up to the entrance with a reservation you should be in your room within 5 minutes there is an excellent hotel bar and a superb restaurant for those that may want to stay in one night check out was equally efficient and overall the experience was fantastic,5.0
bad experience for us all,"me and 3 girls stayed at this hotel briefly the outside of the hotel seems nice an updated but the inside is a different story when we arrived the floor in our room was very damp  the room was rather bare and echoed really bad  we had to go to the front to get a remote for the tv the nights sleep was not great and one of the beds was horrible
the next night we arrived back late to our hotel and found that the mattress was in terrible conidition  the picture posted on this site was what it looked like 1130pm and a girl in our room made a call to the front desk where he was less that customer friendly she had to go to the front desk for help and he was not helpful and ended calling the cops for us to leave when he was the real problem we got our money back and left to find a nicer hotel thank goodness we left there  the cops had even mentioned it was not a nice place
dont stay here",1.0
one of san franciscos finest,i have stayed a many hotels for business and leisure and found the hilton union square to be more than adequate i actually visited the hilton two weeks for two different business meetings and found the service provided by the staff to be exceptional the hotel is located within walking distance of many restaurants night life and a varity of shopping venues i stayed in one of the suites which our group used as a hospitality gathering place the staff provided excellent service and the rooms were exceptional,5.0
spacious and comfy  but a bit tired around the edges,stayed for one night at the beinning of october the hotel is in an excellent location and is easy to get to and from everything of interest rooms are spacious and the bed is really comfortable impressed with the clean bathroom as well furnishings are a bit tired around the edges and showing some age not much of a view from our room not as romantic as i had hoped and somewhat pricey 220 try to find a cheaper rate if you can not a bad place to stay though,4.0
always comfortable,stay here often usually very comfortable and consistant rooms are average but have always found them clean breakfast fare is pretty standardmuffins toast cereal waffles etc easy access to the airport dennys and several burger places next door easy to get a quick meal before heading out good shuttle service recommend you book room directly on their website i have found these are the best rates i always book as a senioralmost there age wise and they give you a discount have never been checked at checking to verify my age maybe i look older than i am ,3.0
great location in manhattan,"decided to stay at nyma for 9 nights in june after reading the reviews and we were very pleased with our decision we requested and got a room with a view of the empire state building which was great even though you had to crane your neck a bit at the window
we also requested a fridge and microwave  but used the fridge only the bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size for new york standards we changed rooms after the first night as we were right next to the lifts and it was too noisy rooms ending in 01 this request was no problem at all for the friendly and helpful reception staff there are only 2 lifts and they are quite slow breakfast was included in the rate we booked directly on their website and it was more than sufficient to start the day a real bonus to get breakfast included in manhattan the location was excellent for sightseeing and a busstop for the hopon hopoff bus tour was just around the corner subway and penn station were 58 minute walk away as well as macys and jc penny 
it was an excellent choice to stay there considering the price paid and the excellent location plus you get breakfast also wouldnt hesitate to recommend",4.0
comfortable but something is missing,"i was lucky enough to be given an upgrade to an oval suite which was a very impressive set of rooms and provided a very pleasant base for my 2 night stay the bed was huge and very comfortable the lounge was spacious and light filled with plenty of windows the bathroom had everything that was needed my room service dinner was delivered quickly and was hot and of a high quality
the reason i dont give it a higher rating is because
 staff were polite but impersonal and a little cold
 lobby was very crowded and noisey
 charge for wifi and for use of pcs in the business centre
 windows arent double glazed you could clearly hear the commentary from the hop on hop off buses passing the hotel",4.0
perfect stay great location,a bit hard to spot at first when trying to drive to it but it was very clean employees were great  a special thanks to jasper who was a tremendous help when there was a mixup with our scheduled tour quaint a true part of the atmosphere there i would stay again but rooms are very small beds could use improving,4.0
beware of false rates,although the hotel is great and the staff friendly if you decide to extend your stay beware they will charge you more than what is online i tried to negotiate with the front desk because posted rates were 100 lower and they would not honor that since i had already stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the higher rate it would have been courteous to extend the price for my family so much for trying to keep customers happy i think i will give the competition my business next time buyer beware,3.0
similar to hotel 17 but a little better,its the same basic concept as hotel 17 except this one is in midtown we were lucky the staff person at the front desk was very kind gave us very simple of course but still comfortable room looking out at the empire state building it felt like it was one of the better rooms and he knew this quiet definitely no frills but for what it was it worked its a bare bones hotel but it still makes the effort within those bare bones,3.0
i agree with most of the posts for this hotel,"i agree with most of the prior posts on this hotel except that we didnt find the walls paper thin  we had no problem with hearing others
a few points
yes there is no pool but the hotel has an arrangement with the university of mass  14 mile away to use their fitness center our kids loved the high dive the center has all the ususal stuff plus racquetball courts but they wont let kids under 18 in except for the pool
the hotel is in the middle of no where  you will need to rely on the van or the shittle to get to meals the traffic on 93 the main drag into downtown was bad at all times of the day
au bon pain had a nice variety of stuff for breakfast and had nice omletts on the weekend  and it wasnt too pricey given that its boston
this place isnt a marriott or anything close  the doubletree website has very good pictures of the pretty basic room",4.0
what a dump,"stayed here for two nights last week and could not wait to leave i was completely surprised by how run down this place is our two room suite had a hole in the wall and cracks in the walls and ceiling it was obvious that this place is old and has not been updated since the day it was opened 
the breakfast which was pitiful even for a continental consisted of bread buscuits and gravy which i wasnt gutsy enough to try but my mom did and after one bite threw it out cereal only 2 milk available and donuts
the staff all seemed nice enough but they do not make up for the complete disregard for the upkeep of this hotel stay somewhere else",1.0
so bad we forfeited prepayment even though im a cheapskate,"we intended to stay here in 9311 based on a travelocity topsecrethotel deal 45 i think it was described as a three star hotel by travelocity but it may have been 2 star our first surprise was that they had only smoking rooms our second surprise was that travelocity topsecrethotel deals allow the hotel to stick up with a smoking room we looked at the room and based on the smell could not sleep there even before we got to the room the hallways were quite dingy and smelled of smoke the clientele was also a little concerning the three adult guests in front of me took about 15 minutes to rent a room pooling their cash since none had a credit card the speed was the fault of the desk clerk
i would say that on a scale of 1poor5 i would rate travelocity as 2 for helping me get out of the room allegedly they called the hotel to try to move but did not succeed they did not get my money back however they did help me book another room and did give me 25 towards that room",1.0
clean and convenient,march is busy in austin and we were happy to get any hotel at all with only one weeks notice however we were quite pleased with the location cleanliness and price after searching many hotel chains nearby and finding them all full we wanted near i35 and near ut we were pleased with the restaurants nearby as well pappadeaux we will be traveling to austin to see our granddaughter again and will check out the la quinta again,3.0
not as bad as all that wouldnt expect more for what we paid,"having just returned from san francisco i can honestly say the renoir hotel was a breath of fresh air compared to the dirty city of san francisco and the couldnt care less people of the city the hotel itself is old but well maintained is centrally located and staffed with a team who cant do enough to be of assistance the area around the hotel itself is quite murky un plaza and civic centre residence facing the hotel makes it a very popular place for the cities many many homeless to congregate although none of them imposed on our visit their presence alone in such large numbers may be discomforting for older persons or a woman traveling alone but this is just my opinion
overall i thouroughly enjoyed our trip to san francisco the people of the city as a whole arent the friendliest bunch in the world but the renoir staff and a few other individuals more than made up for the rest
thanks a mill renoir especially philip and ricardo on the front desk",4.0
deserves a great rating,"this small hotel is in a great location if you want to experience staying in a great neighborhood rather than a crowed business or tourist district it is about a 10minute walk from the convention center and the market street subway so you dont have to pay for a taxi from the airport or train station if your luggage has good wheels
great neighborhood restaurants at least two are byob and they dont even charge a corkage fee the state liquorwine store is a bit less than a 10 minute walk away on locust between 12 and 13 streets they are open in the evening but close at 5 on sunday
very clean small bathrooms but not a problem some rooms may be small splurge for a larger room  its still cheap aaa 10 discount
they have 2 free internet terminals which should have good availability for this 48 room hotel with free wifi in the rooms free printing of boarding passes but 1page otherwise
very good breakfast as long as you are not low carb limited
reserve as soon as you can because there is great demand for this hotel with great value appears to have been renovated just a few years ago am looking forward to my next visit",5.0
great value  too many noisy children,"my partner and i stayed here for 6 days as a base for exploring washington dc the positives were fantastic staff  large well appointed room a free breakfast was included the food supplied was ok but the general crowd noise mess  children running free were hard to cope with the same can be said for the managers drinks
this hotel is great value for money but i would only recommend if for families it is not relaxing for couples or business people",4.0
not upto the expected four seasons brand customer experience,when you stay at a four seasons you expect certain key deliverablesthe four seasons san francisco meets most of these but where it does not is the conceirge servicesthey have a very serious attitude problem and are actually quite useless and dont bother to fulfil requestsi suggest the four seasons san francisco management sends off their conceirge to the new york four seasons to see how it should be done and invest in correcting their attitude,3.0
exceptional on the riverwalk,i stayed here for 2 weeks on business the facilities are way above average for the price and i could not have asked for anything more it is centrally located on the riverwalk meeting facilities were adequate what trully made the 2 week long experience was the hotel staff a true delight everyone from the front desk security valet meeting rooms staff kitchen housekeeping bistro etcwere knowledgable very friendly engaging warm and professional it is rare when you come across a property where there is a consistant level of high service across all departments congratulations,5.0
best and coolest hotel in ny,i spend again 2 days in ny andaz 5th got the nicest and biggest rooms on the 11th floors the rooms even got a terasse the stuff makes you feel like home in the basement there is the bar great stuff  great cocktails  just the bar manager is a little bit stiffthe cocktails are wonderfull,5.0
great location,the location was unbeatable 3 blocks away from the white house and plenty to do around the area one complaint the staff was ok rain poured down on us and we were waiting for our bags to be brought up so in the mean time i asked for robes so we could at least get out of our wet clothes i waited and waited they never came i called front desk 2 more times requesting the robes and by the last time the lady even said that i already had 3 requests well if they had brought me the robes in the first try i wouldnt have to make 3 requests that lady made me feel stupid for asking for a simple thing like i shouldnt be bothering her with my silly request but all in all great location breakfast at twiggs was delicious and the waitstaff was definitely super friendly and helpful,4.0
decent place to stay close to attractions,very decent hotel clean and provides free parking and breakfast liked selfmade wafles fruits eggs and sausage not expensive and close to all attractions family hotel with free internet and wifi,4.0
help hurricane irene messing up plans trying hard to contact hotel,we were booked to go to this hotel but had to reschedule our trip thanks to hurricane irene disrupting flights now trying desperately to get in touch with hotel to check our booking has been rescheduled for 2nd  9th sept spoke to someone midstorm and she confirmed itd be ok but said shed need to wait for the manager to change the booking and we should phone back but phone lines now look like theyre down with storm damage if the manager is reading this please get in touch really looking forward to going and hoping itll all be ok will add a proper review once weve been,4.0
surpassed my expectations,"i recently attended a conference that was being held at the grand hyatt so for convenience booked a 2 night stay at the hotel i usually like to stay at boutique hotels for a more personal touch i was a bit wary that the grand hyatt would be like a convention center type hotel but had a really wonderful time 
 the location is perfect i was fortunate to get a room overlooking union square with the christmas tree and icerink in view macys saks and barneys are just down the street and so cute to see the spca dogs and cats up for adoption in the windows of macys it is a few blocks north of the montgomery bart stop
 the room was spacious modern and bright instead of drapery there was a button operated window screen i felt so relaxed the only thing that i disliked was that one could hear the wind but i was so tired that once i fell asleep it wasnt an issue
 the restaurant on the 37th floor has panoramic views of the bay and city unfortunately the area reserved for happy hour is limited so it was packed at 5pm with so many great restaurants in san francisco including those with michelin stars i ended up eating outside the restaurant
 i am definitely looking forward to returning to san francisco and a stay at the grand hyatt",4.0
bathroom lights and elevator frights,"yes the hotel is very beautiful with a luxurious feel but you can read that in all of the other reviews here are some of the items that i thought were most pertinent
valet parking is 33 a night we found that a bit steep considering additional tips we decided to park at an overnight parking garage merchants garage i think it was 16 for 24 hours and less than a five minute walk from the hotel which we figured would be faster than doing valet do some research on google maps to look around for what is best for you
yes the elevators are fast but they also say that you are on the desired floor seconds before you actually stop this gave me a few brief heart attacks when going to the lobby thinking that we were crashing into the ground
the rooms are very nice but somewhat small for what i expected we had a king room
the tv is very large for a hotel but with a limited channel selection i dont think anyone really wants to watch the exercise channel when on vacation or on a business trip
the bathrooms are fantastic and very clean i did not find any hair in the shower like i normally do in other hotels they include a soaking tub glass shower with a duel shower head phone tv dimming lights hairdryer and a makeup mirror towels are over sized 
lots of fun bathroom goodies including shampoo conditioner shower gel soap body lotion qtips dental picks mouthwash nail file and a dental kit which includes the smallest and therefore cutest toothpaste i have ever seen the products were all very nice and of good quality
the hotel offers free bottled water at the desk if you ask however it is not chilled
turn down service includes getting the bed ready dimmed lights light sconces by bed turned on music and free bottled water and ice
we ate breakfast at the capital grille using the coupons we were given i think because we are hilton honors members they were good for a free continental breakfast assorted pastries and fruit with coffee juice etc or 10 off a meal my husband opted for a meal that included eggs potatoes bacon toast fruit and coffee normally 14 i got the healthy start meal with came with fresh fruit strawberries blueberries and blackberries and tons of yogurt and yummy granola normally 11 both meals very excellent however it was a very fancy restaurant and we felt under dressed in jeans among the business travelers we dinned near however when we left we saw many others dressed like us it was hard to tell what the dress was before entering because you cannot see into the restaurant before you enter
the hotel is connected to a sky walk called the arts garden which will take you to the circle centre mall lots of good shops without having to go outside
yes the hotel charges for internet but we saw a sign in the arts garden for free wifi it is connected to the second floor of the hotel with lots of places to sit if you really dont want to pay
there are plenty of restaurants surrounding the hotel rock bottom brewery weber grill panera champps hard rock cafe just to name a few
overall we were both very happy with our stay and would return again",5.0
absolutely horrid,worst excuse for a luxury hotel ive ever seen anywhere including the third or fourth world astayed in upgraded king room with hilton diamond highest status rooms are extremely dated and in poor condition bed and bed linens smelled as if they had not been changed from the last guest the beds had to be changed twice on check in and the pillows had to be swapped out for new ones room was not ready despite diamond status and notification to the hotel upon booking of time of arrival carpet was so worn as to be slippery and indeed we did both slip several times very very loud even for location i have lived in and visited manhattan my whole life and i assure you there are much better hotels at the price  try the sherry netherland or lowes regency when i was a child in manhattan this was known as an hotel for business parvenu tourists and an event venue for second rate debutante balls  but i cannot think anyone in even any of these classes would put up with this hotel if you really think there is something special about this hotel visit the lobby and the bar  if you need to get your hair done go the kenneths by all means  but for heavens sake stay elsewhere,1.0
favorite hotel in nyc,i recently stayed at the blakely on a business trip to new york and had a great experience my room was much biggerr than i expected with wood floors and a warm decor with lots of character great view from my 7th floor window rain shower in the bathroom great complimentary breakfast perfect location and attentive service the only downside was the tiny elevator,4.0
great hotel good area,"i booked a room in the french quarters february 13 2012 for the next day valentines day the person who took my reservation was very friendly while taking my information he checked to see how i was getting into the city and told me about a parking garage they have a deal with that was only a block away 30 for 24hrs 
when we checked in they were able to upgrade us to a room with a king originally they only had doubledouble rooms it ended up being the same low price of 200 which is low in comparison to the other hotels in the area
the room was great 103 extremely comfortable bed kitchen area was nice keurig coffee machine sink minifridge with water electric stovetop large flatscreen tv with dvd player desk with a hookup to the internet including instructions closet had iron ironingboard and a little stool for luggage dresser with 3 drawers decor was very nice with a brick wall behind the bed bathroom has a large stall shower with a glass doorwall room was spotless
my girlfriend had issues sleeping in the early morning because the traffic outside garbage trucks delivery trucks etc but that is any nyc hotel especially on a lower floor newspaper delivery right outside your door new york post continental breakfast
the bar attached to the hotel was very cool burbon street we had a few drinks there before heading out there are a number of barsrestaurants within 5 minutes of the hotel
overall great stay",5.0
good location dismissive staff,"this is a great airport hotel if your planning a layover in la as its really close to lax dont expect much in the way of customer service though 
i asked the concierge on two separate occasions staff members for assistance and was met with a dismissive attitude the first time he actually answered the phone in mid conversation with me  offered no apology the reception staff arent much better to be honest one particular girl who looked like she really didnt want to be there and would be better placed working on the phones 
this coupled with the hairs and cigarette ends round the pool will ensure that ill be taking my business to the westin which is just down the street",3.0
location location clean,our family booked four rooms for 4 nights including a large suite service was good the breakfast was brought to the room promptly and was excellent the valet busted his buns hailing a taxi every time we needed one though the waits were sometimes quite long the ny times was waiting outside our door each morning the rooms were clean but somewhat cramped and small there were sufficient easily accessible electrical outlets for laptops the refrigerator was packed with items we did not want such that there was no room for leftovers so we moved some of the items out of the frig to make room for leftovers and were charged for those items because they had been moved this issue was rectified by a simple complaint and our account credited i cannot comment on the hotel restaurants because we did not eat there overall the stay was acceptable especially considering the prime location on central park,4.0

great stay with no problems,ive just returned from 7 nights in sf and had a great stay in this hotel arrived about 1 12 hour before check in time and we were upgraded to a king room on 23rd floor and able to check in immediately the front desk staff were all very friendly and i have no complaints about them the room was large and bright the bed was comfortable although soft so if you like a hard mattress it may not be ideal bathroom was small but nice im a light sleeper and did find that the room doors were loud when openingclosing but other than that there were no real problems with noise requested a few extra coffeesmilk during the week and these were bought up to the room quickly by very pleasant members of staff internet was 1495 for 24 hours breakfast 28 per person unless included in room rate but there were plenty of nice places to grab something for breakfast around the area so we didnt bother with the hotel one at first i wasnt sure about the location but by the end of the week i was convinced that the location was great all the public transport we tookleft from market street which is only a couple of blocks away and we would have had to walk just as far if we had stayed in union square like others after reading some of the reviews on here i was a bit worried but had absolutely no problems once we were there and would definitely return,5.0
on top of san fran central to everything,"request a corner room if u can we had sweeping views over half of san fran
lovely hotel we enjoyed being on top of the hill a good calorie burner",5.0
absolutely terrible,"i recently completed a stay at the residence inn  houston medical center i travel quite a bit as part of my job  probably around 2000 nights over the last dozen years the hotel itself certainly was much nicer than the average hotel that ive stayed at over the years however id have to say that there were a few issues
 my flight into houston was cancelled and i was rerouted through several other air carriers these airlines were unable to successfully deliver my luggage in a timely manner alas i checked into the hotel on march 10 2008 without my luggage
 i went to a grocery store along the way and i picked up a bunch of food and essentials for the week on the morning of march 11 2008 i left all of these items in my hotel room along with my toiletries medications platinum arrival gift and several other belongings i also left a note asking for the ac to be looked at as it was not working luckily the room was not uncomfortably warm yet
 my luggage managed to be delivered to the hotel later that afternoon i picked it up when i stopped by the hotel during a quick break in my work schedule i was very happy that it arrived and i brought it up to my room curiously the room was in a state of disarray every cabinet and drawer in the entire suite had been left open and the sofa cushions were propped up in a very odd manner this was odd but i just figured that some special cleaning had been done or something lots of odd things tend to happen in hotels
 my elation at the luggage arrival must have kept me from immediate recognizing that almost all the things that i had left in the room that morning were now missing i did notice that my note about the ac had disappeared and the air blowing out of the vent felt slightly cool i figured that they must have fixed it i turned down the thermostat a few more degrees and went back to work
several hours later when i arrived back in the room it was still quite warm in the room i went to grab a water out of the refrigerator and i saw that it had been completely emptied out i quickly realized everything else was missing as well except for my cell phone charger and a magazine i had left in the restroom i called the front desk and asked for an explanation and i was told that it must have been a mistake i was absolutely furious i ended up leaving a message for the hotel general manager barry shank explaining my situation the room was very warm  clearly the air conditioning was still not working properly
 the next morning march 11 2008 i left a series of notes in the room asking for my belongings to be returned and for the ac to be fixed to be safe i packed up all of my belongings before i left the room i stopped by the hotel again that afternoon to find that all my notes had been removed except for the one on the thermostat and nothing noticeable had been done to fix the ac the room was uncomfortably hot i searched the internet for alternate accommodations but due to the nearby rodeo in houston the area was sold out
 none of my belongings were returned but there was a message from mr shank on my phone letting me know that i was welcome to go back to the grocery store and repurchase everything that the hotel had removed and i would be reimbursed apparently i was guilty of not leaving enough luggage in the room which at this particular hotel is understood to be a signal to the hotel staff to steal everything in the room clearly im paraphrasing a bit but the implication was definitely made that i was at least partially to blame for not leaving any luggage in the room and i was lucky to have received such a generous offer nonetheless i decided it would be a waste of my time to purchase more items which the hotel staff may or may not steal again
there was also an easter basket on the counter filled with some candy particularly peeps marshmallow bunnies that would be a fine gesture but i am vegan and i dont eat candy made of ground up horse hooves
 on my way out of the hotel i stopped by the front desk and explained the situation with the ac i talked very slowly and i made sure that the gentleman understood that it was not working i must have been successful as when i returned to my room late that evening i had a voicemail from someone explaining that the maintenance staff had determined that there was a problem with the air conditioning in my room mind you it wasnt actually fixed yet but they were going to fix it someday in the meantime the hotel was going to need me to change rooms the next day
 i rolled around in bed for a while sweating and uncomfortable eventually i decided to leave my 189 per night room and go out to my car and sleep since it was much cooler outside it was the best sleep i had during my stay
 on the morning of march 12 2008 i was able to find a new hotel i gleefully brought a premature end to my stay at the residence inn  houston medical center",1.0
thirty minutes for a fork twenty minutes for my carbut nice helpful staff decent rooms,"unfortunately i have to highlight that room service kept me on hold for 30 minutes and all i wanted was a fork also valet parked my car in the wrong place so had to wait 20 minutes for my lost car other than that room service food was one of worst if not the worst ive ever had but enough of the good things
seriously i got a phenomenal rate with valet parking included i thought the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and when i did complain no questions asked my lousy room service was taken off the bill etc
although my room smelled old and musty the whole time it was very clean housekeeping very prompt and thorough front desk staff very accommodating and in spite of the 30 and 20 min wait i had a very positive experience",3.0

after our pleasant check in and dropping our stuff in the room we headed for our traditional burger at champions as usual the burgers were great and so was the service
after a good night sleep in the comfy bed we woke up in the morning to our bill and a hand written note from michelle thanking us for our business and wishing us a safe journey that started the day out right a small gesture that meant so much to us good training marriott and thank you michelle",5.0

nice for the price,i have used this hotel about 20 times yes if you get a regular room it is very small basically only fits the bed with minimal walking space i have also stayed in a family suite which was huge  almost like an apartment and is not that much more in price the hotel is extremely quite the staff is nice  and it is very cheap at times i have found a room for 80 alot of the time you just have to keep checking,5.0
adequate hotel but seen better days,"i had stayed in this hotel before so decided that due to the good location i would stay again
however it seemed that nothing had changed apart from the new tvs since i had last stayed there 5 years ago the outside of the hotel does not have the wow factor but the foyer is nice and the staff helpful
the rooms however have seen better days the bathroom suite needs a complete overhaul  deep clean and the bedding was yellowingold however it was clean
the location of the hotel is good 49th and 10th a 510 minute walk from times square and broadway
overall if you only want somewhere to rest your head at the end of a long day of sightseeing then this hotel is adequate for your needs which it was for us however if you want to sleep and bathe in luxury then i suggest you stay in the hilton up the road",3.0
cute but beware the rockhard beds,i pricelined a room at the last minute and ended up here this is a cute little boutique hotel with quaint rooms the only criticism i have is the rock hard beds yowch i woke up with a sore back the next morning i think the floor would have been more forgiving oh and the road noise from outside was a bit much,3.0
an amazing place to stay downtown,we booked this hotel using points on our credit card when we arrived we were immediately greeted by a friendly face we arrived several hours before checkin however they let us checkin early they also gave us a free room upgrade the hotel is absolutely stunning in addition it is off of state street there are many things to do  shopping dinning theater it is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the united center or the airport the hotel also allowed us to have a late checkout at no additional charge the room was so dark and quiet we slept in,5.0

great marina service ok hotel,i spent one week with my family at the hyatt we stayed on our boat in one of the rented slips that was great we were right near einsteins bagels mark tha harbor manager was awsome we stayed two night in a double room ocean view suite the room was ok the service was not so good we had a stained dirty blanket we called for an extra blanket four times and had to go to the front desk and complain the following day before we received the blanket we requested extra towels but never received them we did pull some from the maid cart when we saw it in the hall way the pools were nice but the wind was not the location makes the pool area very windy and cold even on a hot sunny day 80 deg f the wind made us cold we are local socal people so we made the best of it all we rented jet skies paddle boards and the electric floating lounge chairs mission beachbelmont park is only two miles away the hotel restaurant red marlin was very good but a little pricey over all it is a good place to stay and we had a great time we plan to go back next year and stay on our boat for the entire week if you have a boat that you can sleep on it is a much better deal than getting a room you get all of the services as the normal hotel guest we even had room servide delivered to our boat that was cool the birds and seal lions can get a little annoying but that is part of the fun the pool servers were great our kids loved the water slides we recommend parking on the street and saving the 140 for the week the extra 20 steps is well worth it,4.0
great value overall and secure,"i stayed two weeks in october i had a 1bedroom suite with a kitchenette which was nice to be able to stock groceries in the fridge
the rooms are spacious but the bathroom is small but clean and in good working order
the bed was too firm for me however but in good condition
i stayed in the quieter end of the hotel room 710 and enjoyed it
the rooms overall are clean and comfortable but pretty basic furnishings however in pleasing colorful taste
the rooms are very secure with good locks
this is an older hotel with signs of wear used to be a resident hotel and i believe it still is in one section but it is a wellrun hotel and in good working order
the shower has excellent strong water pressure which i miss 
the hotel staff is nice courteous and very attentive adam is especially helpful with a great personality

the best location but noisy,"you couldnt ask for a better location if you need access to all of san francisco walk out the door and you run into two cable car lines powell hyde and powell mason close to bart and a 10 minute ride to caltrans public transportation is the best i recommend going to the visitor center first to buy a muni passport muni is a general term covering all of public transportation buses railways and cable cars not bart or caltrans
we had room 1116 one king bed not the biggest room and the bathroom was about as small as they come temperature control was excellent although the weather was perfect the free continental breakfast wasnt much fruit and toastcroissant or a muffin try loris dinner across the street towards market street
even though we were on the 11th floor the street sounds came up loud and clear the cable cars are especially noisy and they run until 100am i think take earplugs noise minimal from the halls or other rooms
restaurants are plentiful china town is two blocks away take the cable car to lombard street lets you off at the top to fishermans wharf we took the f railway to alcatraz tour 
id go back but i might try to find a hotel off the cable car street",4.0

a perfect hotel for a memorable trip with our grandchildren,we traveled to chicago on the train with our two grandsons ages 4 and 7 for a three day stay in the city we were somewhat skeptical of our hyatt regency reservation after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor we were pleased as we entered the hotel and met friendly employees at the door the front desk and throughout the hotel we were fortunate to book a room through travelzoo offering an upgrade to the regency club located on floors 3235 of the west tower our room was on the 35th floor and had a lake view so our grandsons could see the fireworks at navy pier the club room is also located on that floor and offers complimentary beverages snacks breakfast food dessertssomething all day long this was a big hit for our grandsons and definitely was a plus for our food budget the people in the club were very accomodating and friendly with the children they also offer free internet service in the club area as we checked out the boys asked if we could return somedaywe would be happy to do so and would always want to be on the regency club level of this conveniently located hotel,5.0
beds were hard other tenants were loud restless nights  bruised hips,the rooms were odd and not comfortable the beds were so hard i had bruised hips the next day its way over priced for what you get and the front desk wouldnt confront the man running a marathon all night in the room above us or the group partying til 3am next door they were nice enough to move us the second night after getting no sleep the first but paying 100 a night is not even close to worth it i would never stay here again,1.0
lovely place to stay,we enjoyed our stay at this hotel it was built in the late 1700 and has lovely character sometimes its a bit of a worry to stay in an older building things are usually cracking or there are drafts or the amenities are not quite up to scratch not so for morris house the only draw back that sound does travel a little bit but that didnt bother us much,4.0
great bay views,we stayed at the comfort inn by the bay on august 25th  26th we booked through expedia and got our rooms for around 150night which includes tax we paid for a panoramic view of the bay  we were not disappointed we were in room 811  had a great view of the golden gate bridge as well as the neighborhoods surrounding the hotel by the wharf as another poster said if youre looking for luxury accomodations this is not the place however if youre looking for a clean comfortableaffordable hotel with a great view then give this place a try we had 2 double beds in our room the bathroom has 2 areas 1 room which is very small for the tub and toilet  then an open area with your sink mirror  hair dryer we didnt mind the small bathroom since we were not in our room a great deal the location was great we loved being able to walk to the wharf union street shops  other places in a fair amount of time we ate at the cafe lombard right across the street for dinner one night  the food was fabulous  affordable i wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone they also let us store our luggage since we had an 1130 flight that night which was nice,4.0
extremely convenient location good rooms very nice bar and restaurant,"stayed here for a seminar during sandy probably the best thing was the staff and their interest in our being prepared for well whatever right down to giving us flashlights maybe ive never been in a hotel during dire weather conditions but i thought this was pretty cool
never missed a beat solid back up generators i guess
the only minor complaint was that while the shower head was one of those massive disks the water pressure was weak everything else was what id expect from a solid citycenter hotel",4.0
positive experience good service,stayed here for two nights last weekend will return from checkin to checkout the staff everyone from the bell boy to the concierge to the bar staff were lovely and ready to help whenever necessary our room was a high corner king 18th floor by nyc standards the room was big and the bathroom was huge it is true that the room furnishings were showing a little wear but the true beauty of the room lies in the glass walls which put a panoramic view of nyc on display at night the view was memorable the tempurpedic spelled that wrong bed was beyond comfortable to me although spouse thought it was not firm enough the room has a small bar with a fridge that you can use for your own items cookies or fudge left by the turndown staff  nice touch the club at night is popular but we never had a problem getting back into the hotel i liked having nightlife right in the hotel so convenient to head upstairs to sleep when youve had enough but some may be turned off by that the only downside to our stay was that saturday night was noisy outside even on the 18th floor we could hear the street noise until 5 am friday night was fine i would suggest a stop at the attached hair salon i had the best blowout of my life and serge was a great stylist neighborhood was full of interesting shops especially vintage cafes and bars,4.0
the sheraton was disappointing,"my daughter and i spent 4 nights at the sheraton which was the host hotel for the philadelphia marathon that my daughter was running in they had a special rate for the weekend event we had to make 3 separate reservations to stay one day before and one day after the special it became quite confusing with the key cards becoming invalid and the maid service thinking we were vacating 
i tried to clarify our choppedup reservation upon checkin but found myself at the front desk too many times the hotel had many other things going on and it was very full
the concierge was inundated with requests but was very helpful in finding a restaurant reservation for us on a very busy saturday night
the room was clean with comfortable beds but there were very few amenities especially in the bathroom the very first day we checked in the toilet paper roll was nearly empty and we couldnt find a refill in the room there were no washcloths either one day we got no maid service even though we left the  do not disturb  sign off the door 
the hotel staff in the restaurant told us their prices were too high and that it was very cold in the eating area both were true and encouraged us to go elsewhere for breakfast 
at the end the billing got complicated the airport shuttle wasnt direct to the airport and the parking was way too expensive for hotel guests if i return to philadelphia i will look into other hotels first",2.0
clean comfortable lax airport hotel,"i have stayed at this hotel more than 10 times over the past few years its a modern clean comfortable hotel just a few minutes from lax airport by way of a free shuttle check in staff are fast courtous and friendly and the rooms are typical sheraton decor the bathrooms are a little dated but clean with plush towels
if you are staying at this hotel and have some time to kill there is an ocean trolly that picks up just outside the hotel on century blvd and goes to manhattan beach then manhattan beach mall and el segundo outlet mall it cost 3 each round trip and you can hop offon
manhattan beach is lovely and has lots of wonderful boutique shops restaurant etc it also has a jamba juice yummy
manhattan beach mall has lots of shops inc a apple store cvs drug store victorias secret pottery barn islands restaurant and lots of other shops and eateries
if anyone has any questions please dont hesitate to ask have a great trip",5.0
older property a little tired,this is not the oldest hampton out there but maybe built just after they switched to interior corridors i have stayed here multiple times i always swear never again but it is just so convenient to where i work ive grown to dislike the chilis next door but the traffic on 183 can get so bad you dont want to get back in the car i have seen several maintenance issues with this property incluing one day when they turned off the water to the hotel to repair the boiler to their credit they warned guests the night before stay here if you must but if you have a choice there are better locations,3.0
best value for the money,my husband and i spent last week here after a day in buzzling nyc full of impressions and really tired it was wonderful to come home to this hotel superclean a very comfortable bed a great view over columbus park and skyscrapers in the background and on the 10th floor the noise from the street didnt bother us much location great and the staff very helpful next stop in nyc mulberry hotel again absolutely,5.0
nice nyc hotel close to times square and subways,stayed here for one night when visiting nyc for a concert we werent expecting a 4star hotel but were pleasantly surprised we had a slight issue when trying to check in at 245 just 15 minutes before 3 and were declined then we had been given a room at 3 and when we got to the room the bed had not been made and there were wet towels hanging up we immediately went back to the front desk and they gave us another room on a higher leveldefinitely worth the inconveniencethe hotel offers a continental breakfast the room was spotlessly clean and had a pretty decent view of the nyc buildings nearby the windows were nice and big and even opened for a little fresh fall air breeze the beds were extremely comfortable and cozy i did not even want to get out of it the hotel even provided bath  body works products and offered things you might have left at home the location is close to 34th street msg and a short walk to times square we had a great night here at the wyndham garden and would definitely recommend it to other people also this hotel is now named hotel 36 it has recently been sold from wyndam even though there are still wyndham signs in the hotel room,4.0
decent hotel in an unfriendly city,i want to start by saying although i am a born  bred okiei have been a red sox fan my whole life so i always wanted to go to fenway for a red soxyankees game at 47 my husband finally made that dream come true glad i went but will never go back this hotel was ok but not as great as the price shows they are we have traveled a lot in our marriage  boston has to be the most rude people we have ever met we got royally screwed right off the bat by a cabbie he made us pay more than what the meter showedhas anyone ever heard of that the only folks more rude than boston people were the yankee fans that were there i am so glad i got to live out my dreamglad i got to see the green monsterglad i got to chant yankees suck while wearing my ellsbury jersey in fenway park but sometimes things are better as a fantasy than a reality wish i would have realized that about boston,3.0
room and staff exceptional,"i have stayed in many hotels in the dallas area i wish i had found this one sooner the suite was clean the bed was comfortable and the staff very helpful we arrived late and 
hungry keith told us of restaurants in the area and of a chinese restaurant that delivered until 2 am we ordered if you like chinese ask keith for the number the food was delicious my next trip to dallas i know where ill be staying",5.0
excellent location service but beds and pillows are not good,i love kimptoms simply because they are so pet friendly but also because their service is normally great the palomar in san diego was in the gas lamp district with great food night life and ambience all the major attractions are a 15 min drive so its convenient the one complaint i have is that the beds and pillows were very uncomfortable my wife and i found it extremely difficult to get a good nights rest over the 4 nights we were there otherwise it was an amazing hotel,4.0
wonderful location,a great choice to stay at if you are on a budget and looking for the point loma location close to the airport also this hotel is small and dated though offers walking distance to the fishing docks and also local neighborhood restaurants and shops very close to the san diego yacht club rooms have all of the basics and cont breakfast is included,3.0
too much noise,"i am currently sitting in the hotel room and can hear so much too much that my quiet family keep waking up
the rooms are fine clean and thing s somewhat work staff are friendly willing to help and assist s the location is great walking distance from the historic sights but we are going to be too wiped out because of all the noise i hear conversations all around us from a kid to people down the hall to outside noise
quite frustrating so if u dont mind hearing everyone  the city then come stay",2.0
room with a view,"this was our first hotel and our next door neighbours who had stayed there on a stop over assured us it was a good place to stay
our taxi driver from the airport was concerned about the immediate area to the south but we didnt venture south of pine street trip advisor advice and we felt quite comfortable at all times as it happened we felt really safe as our floor was swarming with policeit was a 2 day interview session for new recruits 
from our window we could see a view over the bay well from a certain angle which was unusually fog free heatwave rooms were a reasonable size and clean and comfortable the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was very welcome the only disappoinment was the rooftop pool it was small ugly looked dirty and was located in a very utilitarian area
as for location there were bus stops and a cable car very close to the hotel and for two of our three days it was spirit of the earth day so all public transport was free what timing we also did a fair bit of walking 
the eating places near the hotel were unexciting but with free transport we coild eat elsewhere the cable car stopped in the middle of china town for example
oh and we had booked our alcatraz tickets in advance",4.0
nothing less than pure satisfaction,"i have stayed at this hotel more than three times  the stay is always pleasant 
pros
the hotel security is always circling the parking lot
the hotel is very quiet very quiet
if you are a starwoods member you more than likely will be upgraded for free
you will receive a complimentary bottle water upon arrival
the hotel offers movies for a fee that are currently still in the theaters
the hotel provide free breakfast and it it pretty good with a wide variety of options
the hotel provide happy hour 
the location could not be better you are across the parking lot from the movie grill walmart is 24 hours and less than 5 mins away pappadeaux is in walking distance and memorial city mall is less than a mile away

the best service and breathtaking scenery,"one if the best hotels we have ever stayed in stayed here over labor day weekend and cannot get over how charming cozy and beautiful it was all the good reviews could not be more accurate the service staff was the most consistently great staff weve ever encountered this cant be a fluke or good luck must be part of their business plan 
weeks before we arrived concierge mona helped not just with suggestions but made arrangements for every detail from hot air ballooning to horseback riding to spa appointment she kept in touch through email and phone calls to clarify details of our trip and to remind us of all sorts of things like dont plan any outdoor activities between 9a and sunset during the arizona summer  thank goodness she warned us upon arrival we met the quickest and most courteous valets in the business while we were still pulling in looking lost at 11p trying to make sure we were in the right spot two valets appeared one on each side of the car and gently whisked away the car keys and our luggage and took care of everything everytime we needed the car they had it waiting for us outside in what seemed to be under 60seconds and every time we returned we were always greeted with two valets to help escort us and our baggages out of the car 
at the pool was a staff of one gentleman jose who was unbelievably efficient friendly and ran the operation like a well oiled machine it was scary how he always seemed to anticipate our every need well before we even realized it before we realized we were parched he was right there with large cups of lemon ice water  and refilled it well before it ever reached halfway empty if we looked a little uncomfortable from a towel that was too wet before we could decide what to do jose was there with a dry toweland he provided this degree of excellent service to every guest at the pool
we loved how well this resort seamlessly blended indoor and outdoor space very classy and comforting decor all around we stayed in one of the designer casitas very cozy and clean but was disappointed that patio doors opened up to communal walking path and there was no view of the mountains will try for a balcony suite next time room may not be as spacious as other resorts but decor very unique  they even had some classic books laying on ledges around the room which was a nice touch 
spa massages were okay and once again decor and use of indooroutdoor space made it worth experiencing

worst hotel on the planet,"we stayed here last week arrived at around 12 midnight the room was sparse no comforter on the bed the sheets seemed dirty and the blanket was filthy mattress was covered in body fluids probably blood and god knows what curtains were filthy and we got a room with a pull out couch for my two daughters it wasnt even a pull out couch it sagged in the middle and was filthy bathroom was gross we had to spend the night because it was so late and we had been traveling for hours they also told us on the phone that they would valet our car not true we had to find a garage about 4 blocks away and walk back at midnight in the freezing cold in an area that we knew nothing about this hotel is definitely not as advertised seemed to be hooker palace we payed 350 for this scummy place
we were not able to get a refund but the manager was pleasant enough when we complained about the filth if you want to stay at a great hotel for the same price around the same area we moved over to the cooper square hotel in cooper square everything was immaculate they were super accomodating and the food at the restaurant was incredible",1.0
great stay at the sofitel new york,"we also booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews on tripadvisor and we werent disappointed the hotel is exactly as others have described very welcoming staff extremely comfortable beds so much so that i pulled the bedding off the mattress to try and figure out what was making it so comfortable in the hope to replicate for my bed at home
very clean and well maintained room and public areas the location is perfect we were in walking distance of most central attractions you wont go wrong with the sofitel",5.0
good value when you need to stay near the airport,we needed to stay near the airport for an am departure on the last night of a trip the location of this hotel is very convenient to the terminal and they offer shuttle service if you need it our reasonable room rate included internet breakfast and evening happy hour snacks that were substantial enough we didnt need dinner the bed and pillow comfort was not raveworthy but ok and the staff were very friendly the breakfast buffet was reasonably good the room was spacious and comfortable,4.0
double check taxi prices to the airport,"what was goodpositive
 room was spacious and nice although no refrigerator front office mr ibanez was very helpful in changing the room from one in the back noisy to one in the front of the hotel nice room
 bed was comfortable
 pool was average
what was negative
 during the morning of our check out the cleaning knocked at our door 3 times at 0800 1000 and 1130
 we asked in the morning of our check out to the front office for a taxi to dulles airport for the afternoon and were told it was 60  even if in the room brochure it says 40 we arrived back at the hotel to get the taxi we had booked and the price had gone up to 75  without an explanation
altogether i would rate as average with good rooms in the front upper floors of the hotel",3.0
excellent hotel and ideal location,"no real faults with this hotel other than the heating in the room in grim when we walked in it was set to 72 degrees and felt like a furnace so had to open a window and leave it switched off for the stay
the hotel did not seem that busy and we when we booked in asked for and got a high floor room with a great view of times square
the hotel is ideally located for access to times square and other local areas and attractions such as central park and hells kitchen plus a number of subway stations
the only negative is always being approached by the sightseeing bus ticket touts when anywhere on broadway or 7th ave",5.0
not worthy or renaissance title,i am a elite traveler on hilton and marriot this hotel continues to disappoint some of the loudest rooms in nyc with street noise windows are paper thin rooms are smaller than any hotel other than w hotel on lex better bet for marriot traveler is marriot east side good restaurantbar scene but rest of hotel subpar,2.0

my favourite haunt in dc,"my work takes me to dc at least 5 to 6 times a year and i have stayed at many hotels in the downtown capitol hill and dupont sq area even though not as fancy as some of the other places i look forward to staying at this property every time
the staff is friendly the hotel is extremely well located and extremely convenient for a business traveler the beds and the rooms are well equipped checking in and out is generally a breeze and the breakfast service is excellent
a bonus is the free internet and free printing facility available
the only ve is the high rates that this hotel charges for a garden inn category but given that it is dc and that the government business is recession proof all hotels in the area charge a 2x premium to those across the potomac",5.0
i will definitely be back,i have been to seattle many times but this was my first time i stayed at hotel max the hotel max is in a perfect location macys pacific mall pike market the tready restaurants are within walking distance from the hotel the staff of the hotel are very professional friendly and attentative the space in the room is somewhat smaller than most other hotels that i have stayed at but given the location cool stylish decor and most helpful staff the smaller space didnt really matter i always always enjoy going to seattle staying at hotel max just made it even better,5.0
good value  good location,location is nice within a few blocks of the pike market and really close by to the space needle also convenient that the buses to vancouver depart from across the street helpful staff and clean room were a plus since it was a hotel from a national chain the room was basic but nice,4.0
fine quality and location,during this tough economy we were happy with the quality of care from everyone in this hotel from greetings at the curb to service of the housekeeping staff all of the sheraton personel were top notch the location was very convenient to nice restaurants for evening dining,5.0
walking distance from lucas oil stadium,"stayed in this hotel for a game in lucas oil the valet parking was steep 35 for a city like this but since it was walking distance from the stadium it eliminated the cost for parking at the facility the service at the front desk for check inout was superb the staff up front couldnt be friendlier or more accommodating the housekeeping staff nearly walked in on me in the morning not sure why they were there to clean my room before i even checked out
once again the beds in the jw marriott are the worst great plush bedding on top of a cardboard box made for a very restless night its starting to be what to expect from a jw same as my stay in houston ripped towels in the bathroom really",4.0
5 stars all the way from lobby to service,had a tremendous experience there while traveling for business its in downtown and right next to all shopping and plenty of dining the lobby was great and the atmosphere was even better it did not feel like a marriott for sure the service i had was tremendous and the room was huge with a view of the city the rooftop bar was awesome as well with the drinks being fair priced i did have 1 small complaint as i was sleeping one morning the adjacent door that connects multiple rooms came open and people in the next room were staring at me so that was not too cool partly my fault for not checking to make sure the door was locked its a good thing it happened when i was there otherwise who knows what would have happened still partly my fault hotel was great all in all definitely recommend,5.0
better than my last visit  a good place to stay,"last time i stayed here i had a few complaints one of them being that the staff were unfriendly and another involving the menu choices both have got better which was great to see
checkin was swift friendly and effortless just what i need after a red eye flight
once again i enjoyed a few drinks at the rooftop bar rare view its really worth going to see the empire state building lit up against the new york skyline spectacular i wish the bar served food or even snacks  i would have stayed there longer if it did
i had a good meal at the ground floor rare bar the service was excellent and the menu much better than last time with a good variety of healthy foods as well as the usual burger  fries type dishes
the rooms are very small which can be a surprise if youre not expecting that the hotel also feels very corporate largely due to the clientele and business meetings that go on there so it wouldnt beat my go to new york hotels like the andaz or peninsula but for the price and excellent location i would stay here again and recommend it for business and vacation travelers",4.0
dont let the low price scare you great hotel,this is our 4th time staying here and well be back again the staff at this hotel takes pride in its hotel from the nice gal in the front desk to the sweet housekeeping lady offering extra towels to the cheerful waiter in the morning always consistent always clean best location on my last visit i had a small situation and had to deal with the hotel manager he was very kind and went out of his way to please me would definitely go back and highly recommend,5.0

extremely noisy barebones motel,"this was the first motel i actually had to leave early and find somewhere else to stay at you can hear the people in the room next to you as if they are standing in front of you part of the problem was that there was a sealed door in the wall but the effect is the same as if they are in the hall right outside your room 
next there were smudges on the sheets the socalled continental breakfast was some orange juice and coffee and apparently there was also some prepackaged breakfast stuff which was long gone by the time i arrived with an hour left of the breakfast the heating was a primitive radiator whose temperature was hard to control there were no cups of any kind in the room 
after a sleepless night i eventually just left early and went to a motel a few blocks down the street which was a million times better for only an extra 10 dollars a night",1.0
expected more from a conrad,"the experience started off badly we had decided not to pay 25day for valet when we could park around the corner for 10 we pulled up and declined the valet service then we quickly took 3 bags out of the back ourselves and put them on the curb where i stayed while my husband parked i was ignored for a good 5 minutes it wasnt until i finally started taking 3 suitcases in myself that someone finally asked if i wanted assistance 
we were allowed to check in at 11am
hint the nonexistent ice machines are behind a door marked private one private room is for housekeeping the other is the ice machine room
other reviews commented on the good size rooms i guess we missed out because the room was cramped there was so much furniture in there we kept bumping into things and each other everything was new and top of the line the bed was fantastic with high end linens 42 plasma tv is a big plus bathroom was spotless and huge
the pool hot tub and gym met expectations
upon check out i was presented with a bill for the minibar i pointed out that if they had checked their records they would have seen that i refused the key to the minibar i do not expect that kind of nonsense at a luxury hotel",3.0
great hotel location service would stay again,"this was a great hotel the location was perfect 3 blocks to white house and 6 blocks to the national mall and for added convenience there was a metro station across the street if needed we walk everywhere several good restaurant close by and an ice cream parlor right next door for the kids
service was outstanding from the bell hops to the front desk and the restaurant they were great with their recommendations for any place we needed to go very knowledgeable we had a deal with breakfast include 204 per night well worth it we did have to pay for parking 30 per day  but again well worth it sometimes the extra cost are worth it",5.0
if your thought regency inplies regal it doesnt,we were in the west building overlooking an office tower good job they were off on a public holiday room on 24th floor had been renovated location is great a few steps from the magnificent mile and on the river the hotel is split between 2 buildings the main hotel on the east is connected by a 2nd floor walkway to the west tower which has no services we paid 89 a night labor day weekend for 2 nights from travelzoo with 50 off valet parking which was regularly 50 a night with so many guests valet parking is busy and we had to go to the basement to get the car with a name like hyatt regency i thought it would have been better i guess we paid what it was worth and didnt get a great deal especially as other readers say they paid 62 on priceline,3.0

clean room satisfactory breakfast and excellent value,missed my flight connection at denver and had to make a last minute reservation room was large and clean breakfast in the large lobby area was your predictable free breakfast but it covered all the bases the room rate was very reasonable as i recall only 82 aaa rate service was excellent i left my iphone 5 charger in the room called the main number when i got home and talked with the front desk a young man looked in lost  found found my charger and dropped it in the mail i called a second time about the shuttle service and talked with the new manager jeff and he explained that because of construction at the airport the shuttle leaves guests off at only one side of the airport,5.0
great location ok hotel,"although union square has nicer hotels for the money i prefer the location of the marina district hotel del sol seemed like it would be the nicest option in the marina area the location of the hotel is great and we liked the colorful decor in the room however in the end our room really felt like a cheap apartment from the 60s it was dark low ceilinged and had a funny smell we were upgraded to a junior suite which had a small living area with a pullout couch and tv and tiny bedroom i dont recommend booking or paying extra for this room since i was travelling with my teenage son he got the pullout and i got the bedroom two adults in the bedroom would have been really cramped the pullout sofa was extremely uncomfortable thin uneven mattress cheap quality sheets and stained old blanket my bed in the bedroom however was very comfortable i looked into a double room as they were cleaning in the morning and i would definitely request a double on the third floor if i were to return here nicer looking than our suite 
there was a lot of noise from the courtyard and pool but i already knew this and so it didnt really bother me we also heard some noise from late night revellers leaving local bars this is not a quiet peaceful hotel by any means so if you are looking for that look elsewhere
staff was always friendly and the included breakfast was really fantastic good coffee oj bagels great muffins and breads not your costco variety free sf chronicle 
i would probably try the cow hollow inn next time just down the street",3.0
we were the only guests in the entire hotel,"we were the only guests at this poorly maintained motor inn marketed as a hotel on various travel sites 
i should have known the second i saw what appeared to be a lagoon shaped pool of toxic waste in front of the place 
is that a pool i asked my boyfriend
it must have been he replied 
the checkin process was rather strange and the coffee in the lobby was empty apparently until further notice the internet was not currently functional on the circa 1998 computer made available to users in the lobby under strict supervision and with frequent reprimands wireless internet was not available
we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room which featured two queen size beds and a roomy but semi functional bathroom we were exhausted the first night of our two night stay and fell asleep without noticing the substandard air quality and freezing temperatures it was literally close to freezing in our room and despite numerous calls to the front desk we were not even given extra blankets to ease the chill
we woke the next morning to the front desk pounding on our door telling us it was time to go although we were planning to stay two nights and had prepaid on line we went downstairs to consult the womans computer but unfortunately the whole system was down since we were the only guests they elected not to offer the usual continental breakfast with no where within easy walking distance to get food we looked at one another and said lets bounce we then snuck out the side door at the far end of the pool to avoid having to explain this to the front desk lady
the stay was without a doubt the creepiest i have experienced i would never stay here again i cant even look at the place without cringing",1.0
great value but cant walk to downtown,"this hotel always offer great rates and if you are looking to stay near sea world and the bay its a good location if you are looking to indulge in the nightlife of the gaslamp district you are better off at the w hard rock or the us grant hotel this is primarily a tourist hotel for families or a good place to stay if you have a flight out the san diego airport

good choice for times square,"we recently stayed three nights at the hilton garden inn times square arrived by cab and a porter was on hand immediately to assist with the luggage very simple but functional foyer with the reception tucked away to the left of the entrance check in was simple and pleasant our room was on the 7th floor and very well laid out although a little smaller than other hilton garden inns we had stayed with at lax and washington downtown the usual high standard that we had come to expect from the hilton brand was present with very comfortable furnishings everything was very clean and functioning our view was over 48th street from the 7th floor and not very inspiring
on the first evening i became very concerned as while down on the footpath indulging in my filthy smoking habit seriously loud alarms sounded and i found that the building just down 48th street from the hotel was the fire station and when the engine and ladder truck went out across four lanes of oneway traffic they made their presence felt however during the night i only heard them go out using a very brief low level siren for a few seconds and that was before i had gone to bed i never heard them again at night after i had gone to sleep and i am a light sleeper i would not let that be a concern to anyone considering this hotel
breakfast was at the pigalle restaurant down stairs and was ok but overpriced in addition with the exception of one waiter the staff were pretty standoffish in contrast to the staff of the hotel who were great
i loved the location but it may not suit everybody as manhattan island is so big with so much to see and do the gray line booking office was just across the street and that was convenient to book and take tours i asked the concierge about the best way to get to newark airport the next day for an 11am flight and he suggested a shuttle service as a cheaper option but that picked up at the hotel at 630am  far too early the other suggestion was for the airtrain from penn station as only taking about 20mins but we would have had to take a cab to penn station i had researched private car hire and had been inclined to use dial 7 and when i mentioned this to the concierge he was noncommittal  i ended up using dial 7 who picked up at 815am for a trip of about 20mins
i would recommend this hotel for people looking to stay in the times square region",4.0
decent hotel but nothing to do there,"was in town to catch some baseball at minute maid park
this hotel was very nice our room had superhigh ceilings was very clean and was very quiet 
the rooftop pool was a nice touch but it was closed bc someone had gone to the bathroom in it and the staff was cleaning it up soon a hot june day in houston we had to sit in the jacuzzi 
there isnt much to do in downtown houston on a weekend one walk around the hotel block will tell you that there are lots of transients in the area but the hotel does a good job keeping them out

a hotel that wreaks perfection,any traveler that appreciates boutique hotels must visit the palomar when in san francisco i spent two nights there after researching boutique hotels on the internet and this one just kept coming back to me as the one to choose what a great decision for starters great door service very friendly informative and helpful front desk georgous decorated rooms we had a standard king a tiny lobby but beautiful and classy pet friendly i brought my yorkie and he received his own water  food bowls the breakfast was a bit pricey but gourmet the location is right in the heart of everything in san francisco and yet you cant hear a sound from inside the rooms knowing that just outside is the hustle and bustle of the citya simple yet lovely zen garden accentuates the inner courtyard of the hotel from window view great decor we loved it everything was fantastic next trip we plan on trying out one of their suites this hotel is a must stay,5.0

everything is ok but nothing is special,have stayed here several times in january with colleagues for an annual convention at the moscone centre location for moscone is excellent everything about the hotel is adequate if you get an advanced room rate of 250 rooms catering facilities are all functional i would be very disappointed at the last minute rate of 550,3.0
everything you needed in a hotel with ideal location our room overlooked a snow covered times sqaure,"great location
great service on my mums 50th room service provided drinks and chocolate truffles to our room
cleaned daily with fresh towels toiletries beds made etc
fantastic gym being a fitness enthusiast i used the gym every morning prior to breakfast and great facilities and equipment available fresh fruit and water provided too
overall i would give it 910 great 5 days spent there",4.0
fantastic stay loved the hotel,we spent 3 nights at the hotel our stay was flawless the room was big and had an amazing view of the st patrick cathedral the service was perfect and the staff was eager to help at all times would definitely stay there again,5.0
first class service at affordable prices,a very nice hotel in an excellent location for access to central park it is also within easy walking distance of time square and most other attractions we wanted to see while visiting new york the staff of this hotel was excellent very friendly attentive to every need or concern we had the hotel room was very clean and unlike most older hotels it did not smell everything was very well kept overall an excellent experience,5.0
fantastic location modern amenities,"i recently stayed at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and overall rooms
the location is stellar and you are in the middle of union square but the rooms were excellent clean and fresh the bedding was fantastic mini bar was something to be stood by and overall a very peaceful and serene environment
the lobby has a jazz club that i didnt go to but it seemed to have a good following when i observed overall i would recommend staying here for any reason",4.0

stylish european hotel in a great location,"recently we visited chicago for a holiday shopping weekend and decided to stay at radisson blu at aqua the hotel is brand new
we had a suite on the 16th floor that had a large sitting area desk kingsized bed and large modern bathroom with a large tub and a separate large rain shower the room also had a small balcony with a view of millenial park one block away although it was too cold to go out on it during our visit
the hotel also has a nice italian restaurant felini that we enjoyed and a great lobby bar with a pizza oven
we enjoyed the location just a short walk to all the holiday activities on state st and michigan ave we will definitely be back",4.0
not recommended staff trained to handle emergencies like the one occurring during my stay,"i arrived at the lax sheraton 4points during a bad couple of days for the hotel
last things first  on my last day there was an area power outtage lasting several hours 
all electricity in the hotel was effected and guests had to get their luggage down 
to the lobby by the stairs because the elevators did not work 
does this hotel have a protocol for emergencies 
i would expect that protocol for a major power outtage would require guest notification of
electricity interruption via staff going room to room to offer luggage assistance 
and to explain the situation to the guests no notification by lax 4points staff was remitted 
until the guest made it down to the lobby area via the dark stairway 
other negatives during my stay the shower fixture broke off and thereafter spurted water
from the side the bathtub would not hold water the buffet breakfast was dry and  prior
to the outtage  the maid knocked on my door at 1030 am  sorry just checking 
i know that chain hotels like their maids to knock on guests doors one or two or three
 times before posted checkout time 
here is my suggestion for the hotel assign the maids the duty to perform the emergency guest services so sorely needed 
first knock  replace sorry just checking with either need any assistance with checkout or no emergencies yet or emergency eg no elevator  do you need assistance 2nd knock  see 1st knock above etc 
the benefit of my suggestion for the hotel is that at no extra expense the hotel could comply with the basic rules of civility and with local state or federal regulations requiring contingency plans for the circumstances i encountered and the benefit to the guests is that 
annoyance is replaced by assuranceassistance
in summary i would neither stay at nor recommend lax4points until the staff has been trained to adequately handle emergencies such as the one occurring during my stay",1.0
clean room nice hotel,"sheraton is connected to the seattle convention center so what you are getting is a huge hotel with little personality that said for a big downtown hotel it was better than most
location is great right in the heart of the city room was decent size clean bathroom was very clean  beds were reasonably comfortable front desk help was polite expensive parking 41 a night for valet 31 a night to self park 1 12 blocks away though nothing special i would stay there again",4.0
fantastic hotel with lots of amenities and great service,"this has been a great hotel when i checked in the personnel at the front desk could not have been more friendly i got to my room and stood out on the balcony and took in the beautiful city view of san francisco and the bay
the bed was very comfortable and the room was very spacious the hotel is located a block away from market street if you like shopping and only a few blocks from masconi center if you are here for a trade show i would strongly recommend you stay here",4.0
what a waste of a view,i stayed at the hilton for an end of summer getaway with our children 11 8 6 from for two nights we had stayed with friends last year and went back to enjoy a relaxing stay by the bay we splurged on our room to get a bayview lanai for 400 a night so that we could enjoy the beautiful view i called the hotel to clarify the room and asked which room was a patio so that we could enjoy the grassy area outside the room the reservations at the hotel told me that this room had a patio so we paid our 400 per night plus parking and set it up we arrived early hoping to enjoy the pool while we waited for our room the pool was closed for some contamination problem so we sat by the bay finally when checkin was official we went to get our room the 400 room was on the second floor not the first when i explained about the first floor the management said too bad we are full they offered to cancel my reservation at no penalty but that was it so we headed off to our second floor room to check things out on the balcony our 400 view of the bay was obscured by a huge tree the room had been renovated inside since last year and they did a nice job with the color schemes but the trendy furniture on the balcony was horribly uncomfortable that night we went to the nice restaurant we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside i asked for outside and the hostess quickly announced that there werent any tables availabe when i asked how long the wait was she rolled her eyes and strode off to check she seemed aggravated by my request that sentiment was standard among the staff at the hilton they were all dismissive and curtnot what i expect for 400 a night after all of that fuss my kids got food poisoning at the restaurant that night so for the entire next day our balcony was lost to the dirty laundry on our final day room service for a pot of coffee took one hour and they double charged our room i have never paid so much money for so little other than the location on the bay the hilton was a bust at the price of their rooms i would have been better served staying at the hotel del or the pacific terracethey are expensive but worth the splurge,1.0
radisson seatac,"had a layover at this hotel in my last trip to las vegas
got a fantastic deal via expediacom normally i book directly with the airlines and hotel but this time i booked through expedia and saved a bit
since the flight from seatac was noon and i hail from vancovuer bc it would be a rush to connect through this airport
so i decided to stay a night at the airport as a radisson  club carlson member they had a once in a blue moon promotion whereby if i book a stay with any of their hotels they will give away 50000 points what can i say except wow this coincide with my planned trip to las vegas and hence i booked the radisson at seatac
took the amtrak train from vancouver bc after work train left  545 pm  arrived  1010 pm sharp took a cab to west lake light rail station bought aone way ticket to seatac cost us 275
arrived at about 1100 pm went straight to island 2 waiting area first time been there but managed to get there didnt rush but just walked slowly and follow the signs
saw a phone near the waiting area pick up and called the hotel and less than 15 mins the van arrived
was told the hotel was just across the street but had to make a long detour to get over there
light rain and cold got out and tipped driver 
check in was a breeze as it was prepaid i booked this through the hotel website and prepay
after prepaying the room reconfirm with the hotel a few days later but before arrival everything ok
no free breakfast my last hotel stay at new jersey radisson was fantastic and hoping for a free breakfast this time no free breakfast
breakfast was either alacarte or buffett i went for the buffett which cost around us 1499 if i can remember
we paid us 7900 for this room i considered this a good price and of good value compared to other hotels in the vicinity
the room was fantastic as requested a king size room
front desk and room service was good and very acceptable to most 3 star hotel no complains
would recommend this to any travellers who want a layover at the airport",4.0
great room great service,when you check in the staff is very friendly and helpful walking to your room you notice the beautiful grounds nice big pool and jacuzzi very well kept we had a suite overlooking the marina the room had a nice sitting area kitchen with medium sized fridge came with glasses and even a much needed wine bottle opener two beds and and roomy bathroom and vanity area 2 tvs with cable and hbo the deck looked out into the marina beautiful view the beds were very comfortable we thought we might have additional friends staying with us so we called down for a rollaway bed and it was delivered within 5 minutes for no extra charge great service the room and bathroom were very clean we will definitely stay at humphreys again,5.0

english country comfort in the heart of san fransisco,my husband and i recently spent 3 nights at this boutique hotel we were in a king room at the back of the building overlooking a small garden the room was spacious with a walkin closet separate sinkdressing table and a equipped bath our room was very quiet with almost no sound from the street at all a full breakfast is included in the rate and included pastries quiche or a fritatta sausages fresh fruit cereal hot and cold beverages all served in a charming dining room with a cheerful fireplace wine and nibbles are also available every evening but we were out each day at that time so did not partake the hotel is well located to walk about the city and the staff were helpful and friendly we would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone wishing to have a quiet stay in very comfortable surroundings the only caution i would mention is that the building does not have air conditioning but it really is rarely needed in sf as the weather is generally not hot enough to require it during our stay the average temp was about 65 degrees during the day time and a little lower in the evenings we never felt the need to even open a window,5.0
one of my favorites,i was in town for a tradeshow and stayed here this has to be one of my favorite places it is a historic building yet they have managed to renovate everything i layed eyes on upon entering you are greeted by young and smiling bellhops and as you step into the stylish lobby you can smell a nice aroma this scent follows you every where you go spectacular clean great scented spacious rooms roman tubs and my room on the 23rd floor had an awesome view,5.0
the marriott plaza san antonio sold my prepaid room to someone else,"i had a fully paid reservation for this hotel for 4 nights beginning march 17 2011 i arrived at the hotel shortly before midnight due to flight delays and was told incorrectly that my reservation was for the following night and that there were no rooms to be had in all of san antonio or environs within a 25mile radius the desk clerk was not sympathetic even when i pointed out that i had a prepaid reservation for that night for 4 nights and showed it to her after i left and went to the fairmont next door where their very helpful desk staff tried in vain to find a room for me i went back to the marriott plaza where after another hour they sent me to a nearby marriott residence inn which also did not have rooms i was one of two parties sent on this wild goose chase the other was a family of four 
i had to return to the plaza where they finally found me a room at the westin i did not get to bed until 230 am march 18 ct after being up since 452 am ct march 17 i was there on business and had to be at a meeting the next morning
i am a marriott rewards member who frequently stays at their hotels on business and i am furious that i was so badly treated by the marriott plaza san antonio the clerk later told me the mistake was hers  they had given my room to another guest who decided to stay an extra night i strongly suspect that they gambled that the room would be vacant and tried to make an extra few bucks meanwhile i faced the prospect of having nowhere to sleep i contacted marriott customer relations with this complaint and told that them that i would post this complaint on tripadvisor at the end of my trip i did get a prompt but tepid and noncommittal response from marriott the hotel for its part did give me free internet access and said they would adjust for two nights lodging but that did not make up for their thoughtlessness in the first place",2.0
nice stay in the heart of new york,spent there 4 nights in during the hot season hotel is very well located in a quiet street unfortunately the air con was very loud so that we had to sleep with earplugs rooms are very small but well equiped otherwise hotel is very good value for money,5.0
extended pleasure w business,my husband invited me to go along on his business trip to memphis then spend the weekend his company selected the springhill suites memphis downtown for our stay i had read some negative reviews on tripadvisor so was a bit apprehensive about our stay from the moment we arrived though i saw there was no need for apprehension the staff couldnt have been friendlier or more helpful from the beginning to the end of our stay the location was fantastic my husband had suggested we rent a car at the airport but i told him from what i had read it didnt seem that there was a need for one he admitted at the end of the weekend that there was not plus we saved having to pay for parking at the hotel of course we did have the taxi fare each way to and from the airport also would have to rely on the free shuttle from sun studio to graceland if you didnt have a car and wanted to go there the hotel location was perfect for downtown sightseeing  mudd island riverboat cruise beale street all a very easy walk it was also an easy walk to great restaurants like flight and a two name restaurant second name suzanne both of which we enjoyed during our visit the trolley stops were at the back of the hotel which made it convenient for transportation to the civil rights museum farmers market other parts of town i did have a friend who drove me to graceland but otherwise there is the free shuttle from sun studio think you can access the timetable online we thoroughly enjoyed the hotels complimentary breakfast and thought they had quite a bit to choose from wasnt breakfast at tiffanys but still a very nice beginning to the day also appreciated computers in lobby with easy capability for printing boarding passes our room was also very comfortable i wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends who want to visit memphis,5.0

small place but comfy parking fees sucks though,my love and i stayed here last month on our short chicago trip and we received a 90night thru priceline bidding the hotels location is awesome and the front desk girl was nice enough we didnt like the size of our room too much since it was a bit smaller than what im used to especially the bathroom but we were glad we only had to stay here for one night the king bed was very comfortable and the concierge staff was helpful in helping us plan sightseeing options in the city of chicago good to be able to walk to grant park and also to caribou coffee shop near the hotel for breakfast only real downer for me aside from room size was the high 42 parking fee even if it does includes in and out privileges nice place though and id stay here again if i dont have to drive here,3.0
the best hotel at the airport,this hotel is the best at seatac valet parking was very quick and hassle free check in went very smooth and we were upgraded to a very large suite at that time the pool is very relaxing and big lounge is great the rooms are very spacious and very nice beds are so comfortable and the best sleep i have gotten at a hotel shuttle service is very quick and so great they leave every 20 minutes on the hour i have stayed at many hotels at the airport and this one beats them all especially with the shuttle service you can guarantee that we will be back soon no doubt about it,5.0
room with a view,"we stayed in the yellow tower on the diamond level which is the 28th floor
the room was overlooking the highway but thanks to insulated windows it was not noisy at all
absolutely comfy bed with high quality linen
the bathroom was big and nicely equipped it even came with a cozy bathrobe a few more towels would have been nice 
there is starbucks coffee in the room so you can prepare a nice cup of coffee at your convenience
pool available lots of restaurants in the hotel complex
valet parking only for an additional 35 ",4.0
what a great weekend,great location great style and great views the hotel staff was very accommodating but the reason i gave the service 4 and not 5 stars is because the service in the restaurant perrys was awful however there are plenty of other fabulous places to eat near by so avoid perrys and you will have a great stay,5.0
way too small for two people,i cant belive this is a 4 star hotel yes the service was very nice and helpful but the room was just silly i would say maybe 90sf i did not know that you could have a 4 star hotel with a full bedtwo adults cant sleep comfortable on a full bed no chair no storage space had too keep cloths in our luggage and store it on the one small window sill over looking a ally the bath room was so small you had to step out just to dry yourself and there was not even a place to put your soap or shampoo very thin walls also hard to sleep when every time sombody gets off the elivator or opens there room door it is so loud it wakes you up maybe it was that i booked on priceline and they put us in the worst room in the hotel but looking on the web site and the regular prices that they charge it is way way overpriced 4001200 a night for a glorified closet i dont think so,2.0
excellent hotel with a decent location,i stayed in this hotel this past weekend it was great my sister and i came to dc to just do an adult trip and see everything we have in the past upon arrival we were thrilled that there was a 24hr cvs right next door along with a liquor store the check in the great  we arrived early then the check in time and they gave us our room anyways were on the 8th floor  view is eh but when are you really in the hotel room the rooms are great  people have wrote that the rooms are outdated and need to be updated the older style rooms and furnture go along with all the oldness of dc the kitchen is great we made coffee and bagles every morning  the toaster is great along with the fridge and maid service does the dishes bathroom is small water goes hot and cold but oh well didnt bother me and the little powder room was great for me and my sis getting ready bed are super comfy i want to take one home  location  everything is like a 1015 min walk not bad at all it was refreshing downside of location is that not too many bars around we walked a few blocks to circa  great little place a lot of college kids though but we fit in over all place is great and will def stay here again,4.0

perfect hotel for philadelphia,we had a wonderful experience in this hotel earlier this week my previous stays in philadelphia were underwhelming with small hotel rooms and i was pleasantly surprised with this hotel our 5th floor room felt very spacious for the 4 of us 2 adults and 2 children our room was nicely decorated immaculately clean the beds were comfortable and the shower was outstanding breakfast was very good and the dining area was more spacious than other hotels with a free continental breakfast the wine and cheese reception was very pleasant and cookies were available daily best of all the staff was fantastic they went out of their way to be friendly and helpful to both adults and children we highly recommend this property to families with children visiting philadelphia,5.0
great new years eve location,we booked the hotel through priceline it was a great surprise received the room for 5 nights over the new years holiday and it was only 249 a night being so close to times square for the ball drop was the best part the staff was a little rude when we arrived one of the bellhops storing luggage for early arrivals was tipped badly by the person in front of us and as they walked away he mumbled for that tip i might not be able to find your luggage we had some issues with our door key and the staff seemed irritated by us asking for new keys the second time around other than that the room was great room service was a little pricey but the food was excellent and the location we couldnt have been happier with,4.0
great location terrible hotel,"this is pretty expensive hotel with bad and not friendly service and cleanliness the only good thing about this hotel is the location  close to radio city and broadway theatres
i wouldnt recommend this hotel",2.0
alot better than expected,"after reading the reviews on here before we went i was a little worried so when we arrived at the wellington it was a pleasent surprise 
firstly the location is perfect a very short walk to central park and times square without all the hundreds of people on your doorstep surrounding the hotel is a couple of cafe  resturants which all served breakfast we ate at ben ash every morning which is just across the road i dont know about other meals but breakfast was great
when we arrived before check in time luckily our room was ready there were quite a few people in the lobby checking in and out and we was asked if we could make our own way upto our room as all the bell hops were busy this was not a problem at all as im more than capable of getting in a lift with my suitcase and finding my room the room wasnt as small as expected iv stayed in similar sized rooms in europe our room had a double bed huge tv with loads of channels a desk a bed side cabinet and chair a very big mirror on the wall and a cabinet with the tv on top there was also a walk in closet with a hairdryer iron and ironing board inside the bathroom was small but it had a toilet sink mirror towel rails and a bath  shower so everything you need in a bathroom there was another hairdryer in the bathroom but i couldnt get this to work 
we checked out first thing in the morning and the bell hops were very efficient in storing our cases for us they also organised us a car to get back to the airport i was abit concerned that they had ordered us a car and not a yellow cab but he assured us it was a flat rate just a little more than a taxi which it was and it was nice to travel back with abit of comfort all the staff we spoke to at the hotel were very friendly and helpful
a great little hotel in a perfect place i wouldnt hesitate in stopping again",4.0
a super new york hotel with large bedrooms,so this hotel is a mile or so from times square but its easy to move around as there is a tube station right outside its a stones throw from central park but the biggest advantage of this hotel is that the bedrooms are very large especially by ny standards didnt really use any of the facilities but the bedroom was very clean  the staff were very helpful there is a really interesting market over the road selling everything you can imagine and as the bedrooms all have a kitchenette this is a bonus if you fancy a night in all in all a great hotel in which to unwind after a busy day in the city,4.0
good locationworks for families,week long stay with four kids go early for breakfast parking is tight but all of san diego seems to be like that nice that there is a laundry room but no where really to sit and wait our kids loved the pool and hot tub friendly courteous staffvery helpful love that there was microwave and fridge in room we will stay here again,4.0
chamber holiday mixer,"last night the canoga parkwest hills chamber serving the communities of canoga park west hills and warner center had their holiday mixer at the hilton woodland hills and what a wonderful event it was the staff and management of the hilton are wonderful the hotel was very festivally decorated for the holidays 
we were a group of almost 100 and everything was done and taken care of without any questions words cannot describe how good the food was for this event the chef out did himself for us 
we use the hilton for many of our events because of the great service we always receive they make planning an event very easy 
the entire staff of the hilton made this our best holiday party",5.0
1st choice for new york,"i simply cant praise this hotel and its staff highly enough the last couple of times weve visited new york we stayed in the westin but this time no room was available at the time of booking we chose the muse based on the location and our previous experience with kimpton hotels we are keep in touch members
we e mailed in advance to say that we would be celebrating our wedding anniversary during our stay and with this in mind could we have the nicest available room  well its always worth a try on arrival our anniversary was acknowledged at reception and there was a bottle of prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in a lovely corner room with views from the 14th floor at no time did we hear construction noise from our room gentle traffic noise could be heard during the night but not enough to disturb sleep
our package included complimentary continental breakfast which included coffee juice and a selection of fresh fruit pastries toast and preserves the quality and service was excellent and was probably one the most relaxed breakfasts wed experienced in a hotel setting on one occasion there was no table available but we were offered coffee while we waited and a table soon became free
all the staff we experienced from checkin to check out at the door or in the restaurant couldnt have made us feel more welcome
the evening wine receptions are a welcome bonus just whats needed after a days sightseeing and a refill was always offered when we took back our empties
we will definitely choose the muse when we next return to new york",5.0
expensive but so nice,"this hotel has a lot good location nearby subway stations lovely decorated rooms a separate shower in the room a microwave an fridge a simple breakfast and very nice personnel

enjoyed my stay will return,this hotel is about 15 minutes walking distance to the davies symphony hall and the war memorial opera house it is also steps away from both the metro and the light rail that connect all the dots of the san francisco financial theater and shopping districts the interiors are decorated with a simple classic ambiance i was in town for performances over two evenings and was able to work in my room in the day time the inroom wifi connection was reliable during the day though it slowed down later in the evening i liked the fact that the restaurant downstairs was not too busy and dishes were reasonably priced overall service was courteous and prompt tucked away on the mezzanine there is a nice gallery preserving artifacts of historic interest,5.0
great location and service,this hotel is located on the river directly across from where you can ride the riverboat if you sign up for free as an omni preferred guest you will receive complimentary coffee delivered to your room the front desk is very efficient as well as the valet parkers and every one does refer to you by your name every weekend they have a brunch that is really beautiful it is not inexpensive but worth it i have stayed at this hotel many times before and this is my favorite hotel on the river it has a lot of history and is not your typical hotel,4.0
lovely stay  as usual,the conrad is our usual choice when staying in chicago comfortable beds nice modern rooms  corner suites always the best for nice views of michagen ave  fantastic location  especially for shopping staff are always helpful,5.0

clean and quiet place to lay your head,my husband daughter and i stayed her for 3 nights on a trip to seaworld i wasnt expecting too much because it was one of the lower priced hotels near the park but i was pleasantly surprised the hotel was clean and quiet and worked perfectly as a place to lay our heads the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating the buffet breakfast was nothing spectacular but certainly adequate for a complimentary breakfast before heading out for the day i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced place to sleep after a long day out and about in san diego,4.0
clean comfy great service,"i came for a work conference so i got a great rate 
airport shuttles and robes are always selling points for me and omni had both call the hotel directly to let them know you need a ride from the airport the free shuttle leaves the hotel at the top of the hour only so expect to wait as much as an hour depending on when your flight arrives at the airport 
the checkin process as smooth and accurate i had called the hotel directly for the reservation
the amenities had something for everyone the onion grill was a terrific late lunch and the conference food at the hotel was excellent most with a texas and texmex theme a fitness center pool and hot tub were popular a onechair business center had a charge for internet use but a free ability to check in with airlines and print boarding passes the lobby bar was a good place to wait and enjoy a cocktail
the bathrooms were typical hotel bathrooms with tubs that perhaps need resurfacing the room was large and confortable with chairs in additional to the very comfortable bed
id definitely stay here again if i could get a good price",5.0
the best stay in the south to call home but not home,ver yvery good service clean rooms my wife love exercise room the room is what i like best location was good,5.0
paper thin walls,"stayed here for 4 nights over spring break with our teenage son main concern is how thin the room walls are heard most of went on in adjacent rooms  every night meaning a bad nights sleep and extremely inappropriate if you have children with you you can hear every word bathroom is the smallest ive ever seen its difficult to turn around in it and there is no storage area at all apart from the floor the bath was not cleaned for the duration of our stay the pool was not in operation during our stay but we had hoped to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine unfortunately the area was not cleaned and a duck had made the pool home 
overall the hotel is tired a little grubby and very very noisy",1.0
comfortable convenient stay downtown,i agree with previous reviewers that this seems like the best noncasino choice downtown it is clean and modern inside with the parking garage right next door 10day if you want to save on valet it is right next to 2 popular upscale restaurants 24 grille part of the hotel and roast also a convenient 1 block walk to the people mover michigan stop if you want a 50 cent ride to greektown or the riverfront unfortunately downtown detroit seemed a little dead the weekends and there is not much hustle and bustle on the streets nice sitting area by the hotel bar  plush sofas and chairs,4.0
its not that bad,i read some of the reviews of this hotel and i have to say it aint that bad the hostel is basic and the service is a bit off but its cheap and fairly close to town our room had everything you might expect inlcuding a microwave and a fridge and the free breakfast whilst minimal was a nice touch it could do with a lick of paint and some real flowers to give the place a more welcoming feel the one maajor downside is that although it is fairly close to downtown it is not easy to walk and youll be forced to get a cab or use their 3 shuttle service if there are 3 or 4 of you it is cheaper to get a cab whilst for 1 or 2 i would recommend their shuttle but dont use it to go to graceland as there is a free bus from downtown as for the hotel overall good value,3.0
delivered as promised,the casablanca was exactly as advertised very nice for the price a welcoming staff and a perfect location the hotel is less than 50 feet from the center of times square the 17 dollar per day savings on the parking garage next door was a nice perk the rooms were small but decorated in keeping with the theme and very comfortable ask for a room that is 04 304 404 etc because they have larger bathrooms tony ds restaurant which is downstairs was excellent ricks cafe on the second floor was a perfect spot for a complementary evening cup of coffee and snack as well as the free morning breakfast we definitely will be staying at the casablanca on our next visit to new york,5.0
like a beautiful gold watch that turns your wrist green,"shiny and beautiful at first glance but scratch the surface and something is missing as a qualifier i have stayed at many top hotels around the world including the peninsula nyc which this is not basically this isnt my first time at the rodeo please see my other reviews
i booked this property for 3 nights through the american express platinum fine hotels and resorts program typically this entitles you to a room upgrade free continental breakfast early checkin4pm late checkout and a hotel amenity specific to the property in this case that was a 100 dollar credit to be used at the spa at the time of my booking there was a promotion for stay 2 nights get the 3rd night free
checkin was very smooth when our car arrived someone was waiting curbside to take us to our room the driver had clearly given them the heads up about our arrival very slick we were taken directly to the room we did not receive an upgrade with a view of rush street and the tourist hotspotpizza joint across the street we were not really told any specifics about what was included with our package or other details about the roomhotel we were given an envelope and asked if we had any questions
room the room is pretty and spacious for an entrylevel room the closet is very small but there is plenty of room for suitcases the bathroom is large and welllit but has only one vanity which is odd in a hotel of this caliber there is a full desk with fax machine people still use those and small sitting area with loveseat and cocktail table there is a central control system for lighting phone and privacy that works pretty well but seems antiquated the one at st regis bal harbour for instance is touch screen and much more advanced the whole time i was here i thought this thing would give my parents a coronary negatives single vanity uncomfortable bed flat lifeless pillows torn sofa cushion and stained desk chair
getting in and out of the hotel onto the street is a process the location of the hotel is fantastic but to utilize it you must take the elevator down to the lobby walk past the front desk and concierge down another hall take another elevator down to another lobby and go out the door onto the sidewalk admittedly its kind of a princess complaint but its not very well thought out and i thought it would prove problematic if there were a fire in the hotel just my opinion
room service ordering was easy the food came within the window they specified and by room service standards the food was above average for taste and presentation
service a month before arrival someone from the hotel called to see if there was anything special i needed i set up carservice from the airport and also explained that we would be celebrating a birthday and i would like a cake for the room on our first night when we returned from dinner i was told that i would get a call back that afternoon after she spoke with the pastry chef a week passed with no call so i called the concierge spelled out all the details again feeling confident that it would all work out three days before our stay i got another call from the hotel saying that someone had spoken to the pastry chef and did i still want a cake i said yes i want a cake but i never heard back from you so i worked it out with the concierge she said oh i will contact the concierge and cancel their order and put this one in instead i said they could work it out between the two of them since i had given both the exact same details about the cake
day of arrival the car service was wrong i specified a type of car because we were celebrating i wanted everything topnotch which wasnt there although the staff at the airport from metropolitain were very friendly and efficient after going out for lunch at pierrot gourmet hotel restaurant where the service was poor if i am being nice and shopping before dinner we returned to the room to find the cake on the table waiting for us nothing like a big piece of chocolate cake before dinner
check out i was charged for the third night on my bill which they would not adjust despite the fact that i had confirmation from amex instead they offered the use of their phone so i could hash the issue out publicly in their lobby while other people are checking in and checking out i declined and said i would address it when i got home it felt very econolodge
bottom line blame me blame amex but at the end of the day it falls to the pen to coordinate their programs and that wasnt the only issue the bar is chic and beautiful room service is above average the rooms are spacious and quiet we did not receive an upgrade despite the hotel not being full which i confirmed with a staff member i thought the service was inconsistent i did not feel valued as a guest and since i am spending my first day home after the trip squabbling with the hotel and amex about 600 dollars in charges instead of basking in the memories i would probably not return i hear the waldorfastoria is gorgeous with similar rates and larger newer rooms with fireplaces",3.0
location location location,"we reserached this trip for months having been to chicago before we wanted to make this trip even better we picked the sheraton because of the location to almost everything we needed the bus tour acrtually had a stop here our bike tour was within walking distance as was the mag mile tribune building and navy pier this was by no means the cheapest of accomidations but i would pick it over others again the staff was friendly the in hotel resteraunts we went to weregood and the all you can eat breakfast buffett we splurged on the last morning fantastic i would definantly use it again
the ony draw back we had was the burger joint in the lowest level were more attentive to the sidewalk customers than those indoors we had to go ask the folks behind the counter to take our orders after waiting for over 20 minutes for a server to she had to seat us as well and was apologetic when we returned to get attention
our room was nice and reasonable i might upgrade nesxt time for a lake view but with the pierwithin walking distance the rivier view was fine",4.0
what more can you ask for,"this is one gem of a boutique hotel in the heart of downtown chicago it provides all the important things that a traveler needs such as free breakfast free internet friendly concierge  free happy hour and of course a clean and stylish room this hotel does not have a big reception area it does not have an overpriced restaurant and it does not have a lot of facilities that you find in the big chain hotels but you really do not want or use these facilitates anyway
great check in experience our room safe need resetting and the service manager was there to fix it in a flash the concierge helped me organize a taxi for the four of us lots of luggage to the airport with a smile 
i wish all hotel are like this one give the customer what they really need and want",4.0

great hotel,i feel i have to write review about this hotel great location minutes walk from time square and subway and bus stations rooms nice and clean small but why do you need a large room in new york bathroom again clean and tidy staff within hotel very helpful especially maria who looks after the bar a mind of information very helpful with looking for restaurants etc would certainly book this hotel again if returning to nyc,5.0
brilliant hotel  beautiful city,we stayed at this hotel for 7 nights from 20th june 2011 and from checking in to checking out we found the service to be first class our deal included continental breakfast which was very enjoyable and the service excellent the staff are so friendly and welcome you at all times the wine hour at 500pm is great and you meet so many new friends  when we were there it was hardys wines which suited us also there was snagria and soft drinks  one night we even got oysters in the bar area which my husband loved the hotel is very well situated we walked to the white house the metro is very close also fantastic restuarants have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and area very safe,4.0
great night before my flight,"i had just spent the last 4 days in the desert outside of wickenburg az and was ready for a nice relaxing night back in civilazation and the radisson delivered they have a great restaurant a nice little lounge and very friendly staff the front desk clerk upgraded me to a two room suite it was bigger then i needed but sure was nice the suite was equiped with two wide screen tvs a incredibe bed and was clean and comfortable
i also ate at the restaurant and had a great meal the server whose name i forget but she has red hair was friendly and attentive could not have had a better over all experience at this hotel 
i travel to phoenix and the wickenburg area about once a month this radisson will be my first choice whenever im close by",5.0
the best hotel in chicago seriously,my classmates and i were absolutely amazed at how beautiful modern clean and awesome the raffaello was from the moment we walked in the front doors we loved it the doormen were so hospitable and friendly the people at the front desk were so nice  always smiling  helpful i felt important while i was there this hotel is nothing like your normal chain hotelsits so much better it looks like it would cost a fortune to stay there but it is very affordable i cannot wait to plan my next trip to chicago and the only place i ever want to stay in chicago is the raffaello the location is perfect 112 blocks from michigan ave and 1 block from lake michigan i absolutely love the raffaello hotel thank you raffaello hotel for making my stay in chicago the very best it could be i couldnt ask for anything better,5.0
nice hotel but terrible house keeping,the room was nice and the concierge  valet parking attendants were excellent the overnight parking is very expensive 33 a day the bathroom was not clean very well when we checked in there was hair on the floor and the toilet was not very clean at all we did not make a big deal out of it we decided to speak to the cleaning people and told them to make sure they cleaned the toilet the next day they still did not do a thorough job of cleaning the toilet at all there were visable stains on the back toilet and the inside for a new hotel the toilets should not look so dirty and dated before you fully check i would advise you check the bathrooms to make sure its thoroughly cleaned before you get settled also the buffet breakfast area is very tight so i suggest you come down for breakfast very early the hotel is in a great are but you have the occasional homeless and old drunks around the next corner but they wont bother u at all its very close to the train and the megabus depot,3.0

has some good things going for it,stayed here on a couples trip to dc loved the fact that the metro stop is right under the hotel this make easy access from reagan airport and super great for hopping on and off metro for sightseeing and dinnerespecially at night we had previously stayed at embassy suites convention center and although i loved the free alcohol and breakfast there i really didnt like the 10 minutes walk at 10pm on dark streets that is why this time we picked lenfant if you stay during the week you have a food court downstairs with five guys yogurt shop aubonpain starbucks moes sushi place and more but keep in mind this is business district and most of it shuts down at 5pm and isnt open on weekends there were 2 or 3 places open on saturday but nothing was on sunday however with the metro being just downstairs we hopped on sunday morning and went to ballston stop for ihop  room was nice and our superior room was an 8 on scale of 110 best was comfy things were clean tv was old and nothing too impressive but we werent there to watch tv they had restaurant and bar downstairs didnt eat at restaurant because it seemed pricey went to bar once and got weak drinks for super high price and didnt care for that staff held our bags since we had early flight as well as held them due to our late flight no issues with staff everyone helpful at check in and out i would stay here for convenience and safety of metro and also location that is close to all the museums wouldnt stay with kids because we like having a separate bedroom from them loved dc,4.0
phenominal hotel,my boyfriend and i stayed at the omni on december 4 2005 for 1 night the hotel is beautiful and service is excellent i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in san francisco,5.0
great location  awesome stay,"stayed at the marriott at the renaissance center on the weekend of sept 30th a saturday night stay 
pros
amazing location  the hotel is located at the entrance of the windsorusa tunnel  this provides easy access for canadians being on the waterfront afforded nice views lastly the property is directly linked to the people mover  we were able to get to joe louis arena quickly and safely for 050 person note also got to comerica park using the people mover  for more info visit thepeoplemovercom 
amazing property  the inside of the hotel is quite nice the facility is modern clean and architectually stunning
great access to restaurants and shops  all without leaving the building  there is a starbucks on the concourse level and a small convenient store located in the lobby this is in addition to the restaurantsbar located on the property
great room  very clean and modern with great bedding and a nice shower
great food at the rivercafe  while pricey the portions were big and the food was excellent
cons
small annoyances
the volume on the television could not be turned down fully unless muted  it was very unusual the lowest volume setting was still quite loud  had to eventually turn off the television so my family was not disturbed
the heating system for the room was unusally loud it might have been a problem for light sleepers it was not really an issue for us
while the renaissance center is quite beautiful it is also very complex it might take a while for a visitor to figure out how to get around the facility
inroom high speed internet seemed pricey at 995 per day
advice
if visiting this hotel from from toronto or sw ontario  take the 401 thru windsor instead of going thru sarnia the trip is much more straightforward and as mentioned before the hotel is located right at the entrance to the tunnel
take the people mover everywhere it is significantly cheaper than taking a cab
all in all  the facility is great and i highly recommend it fyi  my rate was 111 us  tax per night  i signed up for marriott ebreaks and was notified of the rate shortly before my stay",5.0
great hotel exceeded my expectations,very nice hotel much nicer than the waldorfastoria in nyc where i stayed for business travel in january lobby and public areas very nice handy access to a lower level arcade of shops and restaurants including wow bao asian fast food yummy and a starbucks though beware the starbucks isnt open on sunday they also sell starbucks coffee and a small selections of prepared foods pastries and yogurt for breakfast salads and sandwiches at lunch in the lobby coffee shop hotel restaurant very good and not quite as outrageously expensive as at some higher end properties huge corne room had lots of space great view and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in you get a little bit of noise from the el even on the 19th floor where i stayed but it is not loud enough to disturb you unless you are a really light sleeper charging 1495 for wifi in the rooms is outrageous though st least they provide free wifi in the lobby,5.0
overall great stay  lovely rooms,stayed here for a few nights in april and everything was great nicely decorated rooms very modern but tastefully done reception staff were very friendly we didnt have breakfast or use the restaurant so cant comment on that location was superb  just far enough back from fishermans wharf that you dont get all of the noise but within a minute or two walk to the bustling front overall  fantastic just what you want from a hotel,5.0

great location,we got a deal on sniqueawaycom that enabled us to stay 3 nights at the onyx the room was small but the location was the best we were close to transit and were given great directions when we walked the breakfast in the morning was expensive and not all that special so we opted to go around the corner to duncan donuts the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful the location was very quiet we were quite happy with our stay,5.0
excellent hotel with a desire to please their guests,we originally planned to stay for 3 nights then switch to another hotel for the remaining 2 nights we had a really good conference rate 220night when i made the reservations but they would not honor the rate for the weekend as well conference ended on friday we got a room on the 33rd floor overlooking the lake and navy pier we were celebrating our anniversary that weekend they asked if we were celebrating anything and when we arrived in the room there was a special treat waiting for us chocolate covered strawberries chocolate treates and some cold beverages for no extra charge it was a great room with a great view im pretty sure they upgraded us to this room based on our anniversary it was very clean and well appointed the bed was incredibly comfortable and we slept great every night the location is great right in the middle of everything but off the beaten path just enough the service and attitude of the staff was awesome you could tell they wanted to please you and get you anything you needed we liked it so much i called down to try to extend our stay for the additional 2 nights not only did they extend it at the same rate they made several adjustments so that we could stay in the same room our room was reserved the other 2 nights and so i at least expected that we would have to move to another room that kind of hospitality will definitely bring us back to the swissotel when we are in chicago again the conference i attended during the week was also very successful highly reccommended for business and pleasure,5.0
better with room upgrade,charming and cozy oldstyle hotel big mistake to get a room with a shared bathroommy neighbors kept shuttling between their room and the bathroom slamming the doors until 2 am the room with a private bathroom was 25 morenight but completely worth it even though i was by the stairs it was much quieter you also get a safe in which to stow your laptop and a much better desk one elevator was not working so the trip to the room make the exercise room unnecessary good restaurants on stuyveysant st are a short walk from the hotel and its convenient to reach columbia university on the 1 train,3.0
use the info from these reviews to have a great time,"i read all of the reviews and called the radisson with any other questions that werent answered here i would say the use of the word resort is a bit loose the radisson is definitely not what i would call a resort and for what they charge they should include a mini fridge and microwave in the suites they will however provide you with either for 10 per night per item i just think thats cheesy but i knew before i booked the trip that this was the case i have 2 little ones so a fridge full of fruit juice milkits a must we just happen to have a cooler that can be plugged in and used just like a fridge perfect the pools are great for kids and not so great if youre a single adult or couple with no kids they are only 4ft deep at their deepest so its perfect for kids the kiddie pool didnt look yellow to me but the bottom surface is sandy colored which probably led to the previous reviewer saying it was yellow we stayed in a jr suite but really only for sleeping we spent the majority of the two days in sea world loved the free shuttle service we went to sea world on a thurs  fri and those were the perfect days to go as we were leaving saturday am the shuttle service line was packed and im sure folks were getting hot  irritated by the wait with the package we booked through the sea world website we received free breakfasts every morning we also ate there for dinner and had the ribeye specials the pecan pie is delicious in fact we were happy with everything we were served oh they do charge 3 for the smores kit which you can avoid by simply bringing your own and a stick to roast the marshmellows with the radisson is very kid orientedwhich is the main thing i care about when im traveling with my kids they have a wonderful staff that does free face painting necklace beading  various other crafts they also do manicures  hairdos for little girls that they charge a small sum for in fact all of the interactions i had with different staff members were pleasant friendly  helpful
my adviceread all the reviews have realistic expectations and enjoy its not as bad as the horrible reviews its received but its not the ritz either nor is it a resort this is a great place to stay if youre taking the kids to sea worldperiod i would not stay here if it were my honeymoon or if my husband  i were going on a trip without the kids",4.0
beautiful hotel  good location,"standard kingqueen room  557
i couldnt resist the great deal i found on this hotel from travelzoo 199night  free breakfast  which turned out to be a 40 credit for breakfast we only stayed one night though wish it could have been longer
once we pulled up the staff there were very attentive and nice it didnt take long to check in and even though we were early our room was ready for us to head up to later we noticed in the lobby that there was a long queue to check in and only 2 attendants
the hotel the hotel was already decked out with christmas decorations and a christmas tree in the center of the lobby i was impressed by the lobby of the hotel  very classy grand and beautiful 
the room high ceilings new large flatscreen tv and roomy bathroom with comfy robes in case anything was forgotten the room is well stocked with amenities bed was a little on the hard side but we still slept well the walls seemed to either be really thin or the people in the room next to us really loud we could hear every word
the good the service was excellent except for in the laurel room the waitress was a bit slow even though it didnt seem too busy for dinner dinner in the laurel room was great but not spectacular presentation was lovely the ambiance of the hotel was very nice and gave off a relaxing and not to stuffy feeling
the bad 50 for 24 hour parking since they can get away with it i guess they might as wellbreakfast pricing was steep as well  29 for the buffet albeit a very nice one per person i guess thats what you should expect in a hotel like that anyways 1395 for internet service in the room they should offer free wifi
walking to union square is doable however walking back up the hill is a different story it can be done but be prepared to work your legs we also walked down to fishermans wharf more then 4 blocks away but that is also doable north beach seemed to be just around the corner very good location",5.0
nice family hotel not right in the middle of things but close enough,"we got there early about 1100 am and early check in was no problem at all even though they were fully booked our room was the standard size for a city hotel youre not gonna find too many huge hotel rooms in dc unless they are suites the rooms are equipped with besides the standard bed desk chair dresser and wardrobe theres a flat screen hd tv and mini frig also i called down to request a microwave they said they would see if there were anymore available we left the hotel and when we got back they had set up the microwave for us 
this hotel is one block from a metro stop which is very convenient theres a couple of sandwich places nearby and a cvs however there isnt any nearby restaurants except the on site marriott restaurant 
there is on site parking the parking deck does fill up at night and they have to valet park your car so you have to leave your keys i have to say they have the cheapest hotel parking ive seen in dc 
the area this hotel is in is right near the new nationals baseball stadium there is a lot of new development coming up around the hotel so i do see restaurants and more stores in the future 
im not sure if this hotel is always as busy as it was when we were there because we were there during the cherry blossom festival in the heat of tourist season and with the new baseball stadium there seem to be a game every day nevertheless even with all this people traffic the service was still good",4.0
well located,"the hotel is well located in the heart of san francisco 100m from union square everything is around subway shops rental bikes shop shuttle to airport bart cable car etc
for nightlife discos and bar is around the only thing is that the hotel was under rennovation when we arrived and we could not enjoy the loundge bar they have
prices is correct parking is nearby and will cost you approx 40 usd night
but with such a great location no need for cars",4.0
comfortable and pleasant,"on the recommendation of a colleague who told me it was decent i spent three nights here and found that it was everything that i could possibly want for a breakneck business trip
the rooms are pleasant the beds are comfortable and the pillows are plentiful and varied i had a large desk where i was able to work in the evenings and the television system is wellstocked with a variety of channels to which i was able to fall asleep above all i appreciated the free very fast internet good for them  thats a savings over other hotels
the lobby is quiet and the staff is nofrills but competent friendly and efficient the neighborhood is okay  you have to walk a blockandahalf beneath the 405 to get to the sherman oaks mall and some restaurants but if youre okay with not much other than that in the vicinity then you should have no problem with this very solid business property",4.0
very trendy at a price,"we stayed there on our honeymoon we wanted something a bit different and contemporary and we thought that this philip starck hotel was the perfect place
location was a plus as it was near central park as soon as you arrive the lobby is very impressive but everything its a bit too dark even on a sunny day it doesnt seem to get much light insidethe lobby was constantly busy with people coming and going not matter what time of the day was one of the busiest hotels ive ever been to the staff were pleasant and helpful the rooms are small and i can imagine that if you live in a big houseapartment you will feel claustrophobic inside my husband and i live in a very small apartment in london and we are quite petite so it was nice and cosy enough for us we never had any food at the hotel cause it was very expensive but we decided to have some drinks on a saturday evening in the main bar we were sat in the middle and we were asked to move because they had to leave those tables for those who wanted to buy champagne or be prepared to spend a min of 300we left straight away but we thought it was quite rude to do so specially when were guests at the hotel we moved to the library bar which i think its much nicer the other bar is more for people to look and be looked at and you feel too overexposed at the libray bar we had 6 cocktails in total at 22 each one plus tips ii think we must have spent around 120 or more throughout the evening we never went back although the experience was good in general we would recommend this hotel as a one off experience if you like trendy boutique types but i think for that price you could find something with a better balance of all you want whilst you stay in a hotel new york is so amazing that the hotel was never a concern great food at flame diner opposite the hotel huge breakfasts we truly recommend a visit to the un because it is a unique experience and go for a walk in central park very early in the morning on a sunny day its quiet and romantic best restaurant we have been to in a long time home 20 cornelia street 2439579 in greenwich village the food is comfort food in good quantities and absolutely delicious enjoy ny",3.0

first time at the edison and wont be the last,we stayed at the edison for the first time from 31st january to 6th february and were delighted with our stay we normally go cheap and cheerful and book in to milford plaza when in ny but decided to change to the edison a week before our stay as we had the option of taking a suite for a little more than what we were paying at the milford we were not disappointed with this decision the milford is currently a building site and would have meant for an awful stay in ny in comparison we found the edison to be peaceful relaxing friendly clean and an ideal location as one of our party has not been keeping great health recently taking a suite was the ideal decision as it meant he was able to relax in much more comfort yes the room was a little dated but you get what you pay for if i wanted super luxurious modern quality i would have gone elsewhere and paid three times the price that said the suite was clean comfortable the bed was soft the bathroom well stocked and clean and we really couldnt find fault i have read reviews on here of construction work going on  i was not aware of any work going on in the hotel maybe we were just lucky will we back oh yes the milfords loss is the edisons gain and i look forward to our next stay with great anticipation,5.0
great hotel,"this was a very nice hotel for the price the location is a little out of the way but a free shuttle service is provided making getting around extremely easy

great staff great location great feel interesting rooms,"ive stayed at a lot of ws this one was strange as it has been in westwood for ten years but i never knew about it when i lived in la its really sort of a little gem tucked away off the main stretch of westwood the location is homey but a very short walk to westwood village the front desk and valet were all very friendly and welcoming the elevators have this cool camera that makes a montage poster of you as youre riding up although it may catch you slouching and looking like a schlub 
the room itself is a bit odd it feels like a mini suite with a separate living room and bedroom i believe the building used to be a dorm and the room feels like it although in a good way as i appreciated the separate bedroom felt much cooler than a normal hotel room i also got a really cool view of the pool
i lucked into a really great rate at the w however be forewarned that valet parking is pretty exorbitant and theres not really anywhere else to park easily in westwood one big drawback also internet is not free i think thats pretty ridiculous for a hotel at this price point also the ac is pretty loud not sure why that is also its easy to hear noise outside",5.0

horrible for families with infants,i requested a crib and about 20 minutes later the oldest wooden crib ive ever seen was wheeled in i didnt let my baby sleep in it for fear that my baby might loose a finger in the gaps in the crib joints the crib bumper also looked antique as was tied on with what looked like shoe string,2.0
best deal near downtown denver,the place is old and worn but considering the price under 50 and location a quick 10 cab ride to the convention center i was very pleased the rooms are very old but clean and comfortable the shower worked and the bed was ok the tv looked like it was bought at a flea market and i never turned it on but compared to 200 for rooms downtown ill stay here every time but bring your reservation confirmation because they tried to charge me 120 a night when i checked in,2.0
lack of service at a nice place,"we like to stay at the hyatt but thought about trying the hilton i always thought it was a cool hotel nice clean and updated rooms very quiet with great view no matter where you stay however the service level would rate a 2 on a scale from one to 10 first off valet parking i dont think twice about paying for someone else to park my car and retrieve it the valet parking was questionable at check in the amount of cars waiting to valet was extraordinarily long had to wait until someone asked if we were staying at the hotel and wanted to check in from there we had to leave our car go check in and then go back to the valet line so that we could check in our car no wonder there was such a long line of cars
secondly check in what a joke we were the only ones checking in the rest of the lobby was a ghost town where were all the people that belonged to the cars the check in hostess was indifferent that we were there and shoved our room cards to us and said elevators are down the hall then she started chatting on the phone to a friend luckily i heard someone speaking to the concierge for instructions on how to access the elevators and get to the correct floor should be easy but this system is a crapshoot the first time you use it without instructions lastly valet again you must call down 30 minutes ahead not a good thing but something i can deal with we went down to the car and waited for the valet desk to acknowledge our presence as she was on her cell phone i showed her the receipt and she handed me my keys without looking up no thank you no offer of directions no offer of any level of service i guess talking to her boyfriend on the cell was more important than some tourist that was going to tip i didnt

great downtown la hotel,the miyako hotel was spotlessly clean and even elegant all at a very reasonable price for rooms in downtown la its within walking distance of los angeles union station in the heart of little tokyo with excellent choices of restaurants also within walking distance the staff went above and beyond and were helpful with directions and suggestions in addition to being cheerful and friendly and welcoming i was traveling with my mother who is in her eighties and she also enjoyed the stay highly recommend didnt sample any of the spa offerings nor the cafe downtown la by the way has a lot of attractions and is becoming a nighttime center as well as the business district,5.0
lovely stay great location nice room,a few years ago i stayed at the dupont hotel on dupont circle this time i was looking for something a little cheaper room was a good size amenities include all the things you want as a woman conditioner body lotion and a good hair dryer would stay there again,4.0
great location friendly staff,walking distance from the beach variety of restaurants and shopping centers around the area nice little newly renovated hotel a little noisy if you get a room overlooking the roads great breakfast choices excellent staff very sweet and helpful front desk lady rasha overall this is a nice little place with a very convenient location and excellent staff the only negative was the noisy room,3.0
great location,this hotel is conveniently located to all of the downtown indianpolis businesses including the convention center and lucas oil stadium everyone was polite helpful and pleasant the rooms were nicely decorated the only negative thing i can say about this location is that there are no usb ports or docking stations located in the rooms,5.0
nice old hotel horrible customer service,was there for a wedding and had specifically requested and were told we had an early check in due to the time of the wedding and that we had a young infant and needed a room to feed her in when we arrived we were told that no room was available and would not be available until 130 the wedding was at 3 and that would leave us no time plus we were stranded with all of our luggage and infant daughter fortunately we were able to stay in a family members room until one was made available for us hours later 100 the front desk personnel where not only rude they were extremely slow and did not seem to care that they had a long line of customers waiting to be served in fact they shut down one window leaving only one to serve at least 8 prospective guests furthermore the gentleman who shut down his window stayed at the window and acted like he could not see the waiting guests while he did other work overall i was thoroughly disappointed and would advise travelers to pay a little more and stay elsewhere,2.0
beautiful hotelcomfortable rooms,"we were in town for the volleyball jr nationals last week and stayed at this hotel it was extremely convenient to walk over to the convention center and be so close if needed to go back to our room we had to feed 12 boys and look for options each day besides snacks both restaurants were great to accommodate not only large orders to go for 21 in our group but work with our reservations as well the hotel rooms were comfortable and the boys loved the tv in the bathroom the close proximity to downtown was great because on down time we got to take the whole group to the jfk memorial within walking distance from the hotel rooms were spacious and comfortable the hotel is very pretty given its still new only opening in may 
recommendation no coding on windows outside people can see in make sure curtains are closed tight as the neon lights on the outside of the hotel building go on all night and are very bright
we have to agree our only complaint was the pool hours and pool bar after a long day of play and some nights not getting done until 9pm you want to take a swim they pool was only open until 10pm and for the parents who wanted a drink it was so crowded but the time we got up there and got one drink we were being kicked out we also figured since the hotel is sold out you would at least extend the pool hours longer",5.0
lovely friendly hotel,have just got back from a 4 night stay room was large and clean bathroom was also clean if a little dimly lit very quiet and slept very well great location staff and service excellent it was the added details that made it a little special ie chocolates and next days weather report when the beds were turned down after we returned from a long day out siteseeing we paid a vastly reduced rate for the accommodation due to my work but i have to admit i would grumble at paying full price for a room which i see as 3 star but i have to add it was a 5 star service,4.0
cheap rate for a suite with complimentary drinks cookies and breakfast buffet,we scored a greatly reduced rate for a suite and enjoyed the complimentary evening drinks bedtime cookies and milk and delicious breakfast buffet,5.0
large comfortable rooms and great ambiance,"this location is perfect for both work and pleasure walk right across the street to the colorado convention center or up a block to the 16th street mall bike rental is available from a kiosk across the street and the cherry creek pathway is just a short ride away
the hotel store serves up starbucks coffee and is open 247 check out the cool climbing sculpture near the lobby bar
rooms are quiet and well appointed but i still hate the smell of hyatts portico white ginger scented toiletries
the food in altitude the main floor restaurant was surprisingly innovative and delicious the bar offers a wide variety of beers and unique cocktails likely wine too but i didnt drink any this trip
ask about the business package that will save you money if you eat breakfast in the hotel and need inroom interwebs",5.0
surprisingly good,"i didnt really know what to expect with this hotel not having stayed at any of the hard rock hotels previously 
the location was perfect 5 min walk to the magnificent mile shops and 5 min walk the other way to millenium park the l train is1 block away and willis tower 1520 min walk
rooms are full of funky rock colours and textures with each floor boasting different rock memorabilia from various artists
good value for 
i would stay here again",4.0
clean central friendly hotel,rooms are spacious and clean the bathroom had a variety of toiletry samples including toothbrushes and paste which was a welcome treat located only mins fom union square and the bart its ideal for exploring the city street where it is located can be a bit dodgy particularly at night our room overlooked the street and was a little noisy but we didnt mind it too much front desk staff were pleasant to deal with,3.0
loved being able to walk to shops,it was great being able to walk to southpark for shopping bring back our bags and go shopping again the only problem we had was the area smelt very smokey one huge plus was there were washing machines in the building when you have been travelling with 3 children this is the best facility possible,4.0
great ambiance with professional staff in one of bostons best shopping locations,stay there walk the inside corridors for blocks with good choice of restr and stores,5.0
wonderful hotel in the heart of chicago,"i stayed here for one night for a business meeting and was thoroughly impressed i checked in very early in the day and was upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the river and the trump tower the staff was extremely friendly and all seemed very much like they enjoyed working there
the hotel had a wonderful turndown service with a chocolate on the pillow and your bathrobe laid out for you the robes are either zebra or leopard print the bathroom in my suite had a large jetted tub and a separate small shower the room was very clean and had neat window seats by every window everything was in excellent working condition and the room just felt comfortable the only small complaint i had is that i ate lunch in the restaurant and they screwed up my order twice and offered nothing but a shallow apology
they have a wine reception every night in the lobby which was nice the hotel is convenient to downtown and close to multiple train stations wonderful experience that i would strongly recommend when staying in downtown chicago",5.0
great price and good location for visiting graceland but,arrived in the evening and did not realize it was not the best neighborhood especially for a woman alone except for the pancake place next door no place nearby to eat thought it was odd when i inquired about places to eat the desk clerks response was to give me brochures for places that deliver didnt even mention the place next door also a place that would pick me up she was obviously getting a kickback on that oneoverall an ok experience but personally will not stay there again,3.0
ace put me in a uniquely nyc frame of mindhighly recommended,"i had a very enjoyable stay at the ace hotel in midtown manhattan near penn station and only a block away from a subway stop from which you can get to just about anywhere youd want to go the ace hotel is moderately priced by nyc standards recently remodeled clean and features excellent service by a friendly staff
i liked the offbeat motif of the hotel as it could be described as stark it will not be everyones cup of tea one persons starkness however is another persons bold statement and in any case the industrial appearance is only a style the hotel does not lack comfort or amenities although at the time of my visit it did not have its own restaurant they do however provide room service using the resources of nearby restaurants and they serve a breakfast of croissants and coffee all this fits in with a corporate sense of humor that includes its motto thank you for sleeping with us
one disclaimer about this review i received a free upgrade due to the unavailability of the class of room i had booked i dont know what my cheaper room would have been like but the room i got had a refrigerator coffeemaking supplies a manual pencil sharpener more of that sense of humor a guitar i didnt check to see if it was functional and some opartish wallpaper to offset the mostly blackandwhite décor there was a flatpanel tv and a featurepacked but austerelooking clock radio into which one could plug personal audio devices
i highly recommend this hotel all the more so if youd like a place to put you into a uniquely new york frame of mind",4.0
loved this hotel,"i booked this hotel via their website and had a last minute change which they very happily accomodated we stayed from march 28march 30 the interior is very basic but very clean the bathrooms were always spotless even though i never saw anyone cleaning them even with a shared bathroom we stayed in room 512 and the bathroom was right next door to us as we were at the end of the hall our 2nd morning there i glimpsed a woman walking by my door from the bathroom and that was it 
the desk staff were all very friendly even sustaining a weekend long joke about my daughters blanket that they found after the luggage room had been emptied by guests the area was safe and central we had a wonderful time and will definitely stay there again",5.0
unfortunately the negatives outweighed the positives,"positives great location and amazing views very nice decor and furnishings price was reasonable helpful staff clean rooms taxis readily available outside 
negatives no indoor or outdoor pool no dvd players for the tvs no microwave in the room free wifi but the connection speed was slower than the 288k dialup modem i had in 1995 some pipewater noise in the walls at night the fitness center is laughable the business center had 2 computers and no printer",3.0
excellent accomodations  a great place to relax after a busy day touring the windy city,"being retired and living on a fixed income i looked to the internet to help find an affordable place to stay for a few days while i showed my 2 exchange student sons around chicago after looking at the reviews of the midway carlton i booked online 
was i ever glad the reviews were righton easy parking nice rooms and breakfast pleasant staff that were willing to go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable conveniently located within a few blocks from the orange line train that will take you into the city and transfer to a bus 
close to ethnic restaurants my polish son had an enjoyable dinner that reminded him of home with both boys awed at the hard rock cafe
again if you are looking for a great place to stay while visiting chitown dont hesitate to stay at the midway airport carlton inn",5.0
great location  better than expected,i thought this hotel was great it is located right near the trolley within a short walking distance to the moscone center and tons of shopping the hotel rooms were more modern than i had expected the room was clean and bathroom was updated the only downfall was the hair dryer in the room was broken and the lighting was not so great as some others suggested overall i thought this was a great place to stay for business would go back again,4.0
trifecta of location price and room trumps poor service,we just returned from a weekend at the raffaello hotel in chicago i booked through hotwire over a month in advance and got a really good deal under 150night at the raffaello after having read some of the reviews here though i was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel we arrived around 11 am figuring we could at least check our bags check in is at 4 pm and we were initially told to return then  but the concierge told us we could come back at 2 and a room would probably be ready this was fine  we did some sightseeing and then returned the room was not yet ready however the bellman had already brought out our bags and so they had to be rechecked no problem so far we came back at 4 and check in itself went smoothly  however they had lost our bags after some frantic searching in different employees offices they were finally located its this kind of disinterested service ethos that really brings the raffaello down  its the level of service one would expect from a college town days inn the employees at the raffaello are affable enough but they really dont want to concern themselves with any problems or questions guests may have  they seem to universally want guests to just go away and leave them alone lousy service aside the room itself was as pictured  quite lovely actually bed was great  tv was nice  all were up to snuff location cant be beat for the price  right off michigan ave behind the hancock building i would probably still stay here again  i just wouldnt check my bags with them if they find a way to work out the service kinks this could be quite a nice hotel fyi  they charge 40 bucks a day for valet parking  and all they do is drive your car to the deck across the street you can self park there for 23 for 24 hours,4.0
great hotel service was excellent,i stayed at the sheraton phoenix downtown during a business trip it is a convention style hotel but very accommodating and even with many large groups the staff maintained excellent service we had no problems with housekeeping and everyone was extremely responsive to our requests,5.0
killer location good value overall great,"very small clean true boutique 34 rooms in midtown location really cannot be better especially for the price very friendly staff efficient service very clean room and overall good experience
room has all standard amenities fullsize ironing board iron blow dryer safe wood hangers flatscreen tv closet with door cd alarm clock good bathroom amenities desk lamp etc and i had a large window which allowed for natural lighting
old bones but i found that to add characteresp because paint tile carpet etc were all very clean and new feeling i would stay here again without a second thought
my wifi signal was strong and great which is key for me one negative was not enough electrical outlets in the room  had to rotate out my cell charger and laptopthey might think about adding a larger power strip or adding new outlets to rooms most people need at least 23 for cell camera laptop etc
plan ahead for food and drinks because there is no restaurant or room service but the location is so good there is much to choose from within walking distance probably too small for a family or a group but for a single or couple leisure or business traveler i would certainly recommend location location location",4.0
location great ,this hotel is on the mag mile and close to the redline l train that can get you all over the city the room was small but so was the price i paid to right on the mag mile  the beds were comfy and room super clean close to hancock tower great resturants and shopping i love staying at this hotel and stay there alot,5.0
excellant value we loved the chancellor,my family had never been to san francisco before so we looked on trip advisor for help to choose our hotel the chancellor received excellant reviews time and time again so we booked over the internet the hotel was perfect for us great service and location cable cars stop just outside food clean rooms although bathroom could not be much smaller excellant shops and shopping arcades were closeby as were all forms of transport i will most certainly stay there again and on top of that it was excellant valve for money thank you trip advisor,4.0
shhh its a secret,"i dont want to write too good a review because hey i dont want them to get over booked but in the land of karma you have to share 
this was a gem of a find for us for several reasons 
1st  the people at chelsea pines  we were warmly greeted and our bags whisked away while jay gave us the low down on the surrounding area he personalized our experience by asking what we wanted to do troy made sure we had great recommendations for dinner
2nd  location  close to the pier soho village the high line and google nyc headquarters meat district shopping

great little hotel,the hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly the rooms were clean the location was very close to union square and market street but at night i did not feel safe going out due to the abudance of homeless people not like the rest of san francisco overall a very nice little hotel,4.0
lives up to expectations,stayed 4 nights in the sofitel in may 04 booked a suite got the best deal from their website staff room and view were excellent i simply cant complain and would certainly choose the sofitel again,5.0
great place to lodge,the hotel staff from the valet bell boy front desk and concierge were fantastic they all really knew the gaslamp district and gave great tips the room was quite large and very comfortable it was extremely clean and very inviting we order breakfast from room service and found the prices very reasonable and the food was good we look forward to our next trip to san diego and will make this hilton our choice for lodging,5.0
fantastic property,the casablanca hotel is a truly remarkable hotel just steps from times square the room was nice  not huge but also certainly not as cramped as some places ive stayed at while in new york the extra amenities free breakfast and afternoon wine  cheese add to the overall charm of the guest experience the hallways were a bit warm some days the elevator was a bit lurchy and the toilet in my room periodically ran all to be expected considering the age of the property overall the room was immaculately clean and the provided extras were a nice touch the best feature of the casablanca hotel was the staff who i found to be extremely helpful efficient and professional  especially vinnie ill definitely return to this hotel and strongly recommend it to anyone with discriminating tastes and high standards,5.0
great deal on the south side of town,"i had been to this same hotel as a wyndham about 15 years ago for a wedding although it looked a bit dated with dark wood decor in the lobby the hotel was actually very nice great spacious rooms and very warm and attentive service they do have a callahead shuttle for the airport and free parking
the only problem which i didnt really mind was the noise of the interstate highway that could be easily heard i found a rate of 60night on priceline for a friday and saturday night stay",5.0
standard airport hotel,"this is your standard airport hotel given the large number of hotel rooms around lax  make sure to use one of the bid sites as you will pay alot less this way than the quoted rates checkin was quick and efficient hotel is very busy with lots of people in the lobby and bar areas room was clean and had standard crowne plaza fittings was abit shabby in places
tv needed replacing as picture was awful served its purpose for a one night stay
parking 12 per night",3.0
beautiful hotel great location,stayed here with a friend mid august and i must say that i loved everything about this hotel the interior decorations and furniture in the lobby is beautiful our room was very clean and the beds were super comfy i loved the fact that the hotel is so close to everything including the subway system a few blocks away shopping stores are as well my friend and i took the megabus from new york and needless to say the bus dropped us off within a few blocks of the hotel i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and i would def go back,5.0
good location but no smiles ,"this hotel wins on price and location you cant argue that it represents good value and the roomsbathrooms are more than adequate however it is greatly let down by the staff who treated us as if everything was too much trouble
we had booked 2 rooms for a family reunion each travelling from opposite ends of the world but in spite of booking some 4 months ago the hotel could not put us on the same floor caution to others as we were travelling on flights from different parts of the world we arrived at significantly different times as i had made the booking the hotel would not allow our family to check in until i arrived in spite of them having a copy of the booking confirmation and the same surname they were also charged for leaving their bags in the hotel until we arrived
on one occasion our room hadnt been serviced ok we accept anyone can make a mistake so we went down and asked for some shampoo and coffee one complimentary coffee is given each day when this was finally brought to the room the person went off with the huff because we did not give a tip for something that should have been done anyway
bell staff were also keen to push guests into unofficial overpriced taxis as opposed to the cheaper yellow cabs
throughout our stay we never got a hullo or a good morning and we were given to feel that guests far from being paying customers were just a nuisance
we did however like having a coffee machine in our room and an ice machine in the corridor
from here we moved on to holiday inn by the falls in niagara in canada where the difference in attitude of the helpful staff was like a breath of fresh air
visitors tip and new york runs on the other sort of tip so this is the only one youll get for free if you stay here try the morning star restaurant for breakfast turn right when you come out of the hotel cross the road and its on the corner its good value and the staff are all very helpful with suggestions and ideas on where to visit its a shame they did not work in the hotel
i would recommend this hotel on price and location if it was not for the staff",3.0
outstanding attention to detail,four nights at this hotel was an eyeopener to how we would like to be treated at other facilities every person at the front desk knew the places to visit eat and those not necessary to see the free breakfast was beyond abundantthe staff in the breakfast room was extremely attentive and friendly as were the persons at the front deskour room 417 was clean  quiet the beds were comfortable although the pillows were not to our likingwe would highly recommend this hotelhf,5.0
a night at the red roof,stayed three times there last week because i was getting my house remodeled i was helped by ivan juarez all three times he provided a caring service and got me an excellent price  recommend the red roof at remcon to everyone cinemark right next door and a quick access to i10,5.0
definitely not a 4 stars hotel,"in the morning upon arrival we were never offered to keep luggages i was obliged later on late pm to bring by hand my heavy luggages in the staircase and across the street to find a valet who took the elevator
in late afternoon hotel unable to find our reservation refusing to see our confirmation number and mentioning the computer was down they knew i had pay in advance  
i was supposed to have a king bed we were given a murphy bed we usually give to children
no glasses of wine were offered on arrival it was mentioned in the reservation
location fantastic but service poor",2.0
basic clean safe rooms in a great location at a value price,"the motel is currently under significant renovations about 34 of the rooms completre guessing that the renos should be done by late november 2008 this motel is appropriate if all you want is a basic clean new room in a great location for a value price this is not the four seasons 
i found the staff at this family owned motel to be very helpfull this area of memphis has been cleaned up alot and i felt safe walking back from beale st at 100 am 
the room i had was smaller then the average na motel room having only one king sized bed a little tight for a couple but definately doable
you can walk to all the sghts except stax and graceland free shuttle runs from sun studies which is walking distance",4.0
lovely hotel excellent service,"we recently returned from four days at the the michelangelo and were very pleased with this charming europeanflavor hotel its staff and the location we are very particular and experienced travelers who make every effort to select topclass hotels that not only offer quality accomodations but provide a unique experience  we were not disappointed with the michelangelo
i contacted the hotel directly prior to our arrival explaining the circumstances of our trip and they were very kind and receptive to helping to make our stay a special experience  louis and james are excellent representatives for this hotel 
when we arrived we were upgraded to a larger room and a thoughtful box of godiva chocolates was left for us our first night the overall ambiance of the hotel was warm and inviting elegance and the service exceptional we were traveling with some friends who had lost their luggage and the staff at the hotel were very instrumental in helping them locate their bags  they even stayed on the phone for more than 45 minutes to get through for information on the lost luggage
we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to new yorkunless you are like one of the previous reviewers who prefers hotels with vending machines if so this is not the hotel for you our congratulations and appreciation to the michelangelo and its staff for the great job you are doingdefinitely a class act",5.0
excellent value for money free parking great location,"stayed here for 4 nights at the end of a long californian road trip read reviews on here and decided to book great idea 
san fran can be quite pricey on hotels and as we had a car with us we needed a cheapish hotel with free parking most hotels charge 30 a night parking so to get it free was great value the hotel lobby is tiny just a desk and 1 man really was a bit dubious at first and as we were told to park up top of hotel my first impressions were not great however who needs a huge hotel lobby with lots going on when you just want to explore san fran
our room was huge with a massive bed tv separate dining area and clean bathroom much bigger than we expected a bit dated but very clean and tidy views were good and never too noisy outside
great location
would definitely stay there again and would recommend
not a 5 star hotel not luxury and no real amenities but if you want clean comfortable and afordable accommodation stay here",4.0
great hotel,the hotel was in a great location just walking distance from the theatres the staff was friendly and there was free water champaigne coffee and hot chocolate the hotel was very clean with a modern decor feel to it this hotel can be for anyone,4.0
pretty full of themselves,"this hotel definitely has an unwarranted superiority complex stayed one night in a very blah room breakfast is dennys quality turns out they not only wouldnt honor hampton inns advertised holiday rates but their lowest rate was almost 50 morenight than the 5star grand hyatt marina we spent the next two nights in on an entertainment rate
unless you have to stay in this neighborhood definitely look for something better",2.0
expensive for mediocre service,my stay at on the ave was not exactly thrilling it is an expensive hotel with not a single benefit no breakfasts lunch or dinners they have two restaurants attached to the hotel where the service was very bad at times i guess because its on broadway and relatively close to columbus circle is the main reason for its hiked up prices the reason i chose to stay there was because i had to attend a conference at columbia university at they are relatively close to it,3.0
great stay,"i stayed nov 09 with my wife for a weekend the place was clean and modern food was good and location is great because of the local malls and highways and only 12 hour from downtown with traffic ive always like hampton inn better because of their breakfast but this place comes in at a close 2nd for the category of hotel class that it is in 
my room was clean big comfy big flat screen free internet couch with prompt room service the whole place had a really decent welcome feelingvibe if you know what i mean 
btw despite it being a cheaper hotel right next to expensive hotels the other guests were not obnoxious  noisy and etc which is what i always worry about the guests were all different family sizes races ages etc and all nice but we did notice the next morning a cars back window was busted out i have no idea if it was from theft or vandalism but im guessing most likely someone must have left valuables in their car rather than random violence because the area does not seem like that",5.0
good hotel great location,"recently stayed in the hotel with my partner the location is great near dupont circle and transportation restaurant and bar very good to excellent service in restaurant and bar was excellent the staff were just okay from checkin and checkout staff to the valet guys no one smiles here they dont seem to go up and beyond except in the restaurant and bar
the rooms were fine nicely decorated the bathroom is a little claustophobic toilet right next to shower and i mean right next to very little dry off room bed was comfortable and most importantly the room was clean to all those who write about the noisegive me a break yes there is noise because you are in a city if you dont want noise stay somewhere in the boondocks the noise level was tolerable sky bar is a nice idea and a nice place to relax but it has no good views except some roof tops overall nice experience lets face itwhen youre in dc youre not staying in your room for large amounts of time",4.0
nice hotel not so great location not too kid friendly,"overall this is good hotel to stay for the price about 130night via htwre staff are friendly and helpful very convenient and affordable parking the complimentary breakfast is good but dishes are replenished very slowly julito the server seems to have a perpetual frown as if he is worried we would eat up all of his breakfast 
the location is not great but as long as you use your car cabs or the hotel shuttle you should be ok not advisable to walk in the vicinity of the hotel
the big disappointments are 1 the shuttle which is usually too full  book your spot early and b not having tv channels with kids programming 
also make sure you get the room you booked we had booked a room for 2 adults and 2 kids but ended up in a room with just one king bed because they had no other rooms available this after they assured us that we would get a room with two double beds they remedied the situation the next day but it was an uncomfortable first night leaves a bad taste avoid their strollaway bedsthey kill your back",3.0
expected less and got alot more,as a business road warrior living in ny area i used my points to spend a night and see a show during the july 4th week ive stayed in nyc hotels before and i usually expect long lines small and worn rooms terrible food and lessthanaverage customer service this hotel is in the center of times square which is very very congested but i thought i would compromise so i could walk to my show without dealing with the hassle of taxis and subways times square was as i expected  it was gridlocked by people and cars lots and lots of tourists and difficult to get any dinner reservations or do any shopping without having to deal with long lines stepping into the renaissance was an oasis of cool calm quiet and great customer service with check in and security being on the ground floor and the hotel lobby requiring an elevator ride i felt quite safe it is a small boutique hotel smack in the middle of times square the lounge has 3 sides of floor to ceiling windows overlooking times square it is breathtaking and very exciting to feel you are in the middle of it all without having to suffer through the crowds service at the loungerestaurant was great the lounge serves as the executive club in the morning for elite members to get their free breakfast the bedroom i had overlooked the city and had a nicely designed tiled stepin shower overall i had a very pleasant stay and would definitely return for future 12 night excursions into the city,4.0
heartbreak hotel,my partner and i were unfortunate enough to spend 2 nights there 2324novthe room was small cold and dirtywhen i finally managed to get the old cast iron radiater to give off some heat the noise was unbelievable windows were so dirty it was impossible to see the park on the other side of the roadthe location was almost in harlem so it was unsafe to walk out at nightdown town was 55 blocks away which means it wasnt a good position for sight seeingthis hotel should not be allowed to continue to take bookingsmy travel agent has been informed,1.0
bel air hotel a little bit of paradise right in los angeles,my husband and i have made an annual event out of going to the bel air hotel yes its that good we had to go to the los angeles area for business quite a few times over the past several years and each time we stayed at the bel air the surroundings are lush and feel entirely removed from the hussle and traffic that ive known to be la while one of the concierges and a front desk staff were a little snooty it was more than made up for by the wonderful bellman the delicous food the amazing pool the pool is a mustsee as well as our terrific massages well let me qualify that by saying that the couple of massages we got were actually not that great but then we discovered sascha and eida and we were hooked be sure to ask for them or you may be as disappointed as we were at first prices range as do the rooms but theres something there for everyone weve had a different room everytime and always were happy i wouldnt stay near the pool unless you have kids though enjoy,5.0
great location,we stayed at hilton times square in may 2011 we had arrived from australia after a very long flight we arrived at the hotel and loved the location in times square we wandered out to grab a bite to eat at one of our favorite pizza places patzeria pizza on 46th and gave our kids their first time in nyc a glympse of times square at night we returned to the hilton it was like a haven we were exhausted and needed sleep the rooms are clean and not too cramped the beds were very comfortable and we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful if needed the next day we walked  walked along the hudson right down to the financial district where believe it or not we bumped into the singer cee lo green kids thought that was cool we only stayed two nights as we were leaving from nyc on the carnival miracle for a caribbean cruise which we saw arriving along the hudson that morning from our room at the hilton all in all a very nice stay at hilton times square,5.0
perfect place to stay for a central location in boston and value,we stayed for three nights over a weekend and will definitely stay again on our next visits everyone was friendly courteous informed and helpful loved our corner room on the fifth floor roomy quiet and very comfortable a small suggestion would be to give a light cleaning to the chairs not a big issue,5.0
short stay,loved the stay here the bed was wonderful wish i had one at home front desk staff was courteous and professional easy check in easy check out,4.0
great staff could do without the velvet tiger decorations,"my wife daughter and i stayed here for three nights while we collegeshopped in dc the comments you see about friendly staff on tripadvisor are true these folks go right up to the line of being obsequious without crossing over
its a good hotel however all is not perfect first parking is outrageously expensive and then dc gets into the tax game for a total of about 50day second the decor is late90sstarckbrown and the place is dimly lighted that combines to make the place seem a little dingy plus furnishings are somewhat worn i especially dont care for the tigerpattern robes which might do better framed on the walls than on my back the plumbing is especially designinconvenient the shower volume cannot be varied though of course the temperature can and the sink faucet makes it impossible to splash water on your face without getting the entire countertop soaked
on the plus side is a location not to be beat competitive prices they matched the lowest price i could find elsewhere and two restaurants nearby to die for the kabob house and a pizza place right at dupont circle on p street whose name i forget
my family loved this place they arent frequent travelers and so thats the difference if you are a seasoned traveler youll see that the cosmetics dont make the grade but any traveler will appreciate the staff",4.0
weve tried the rest and this is the best,corny but accurate we visit sa frequently as we only live 80 miles north weve stayed at many riverwalk hotels and while theres some worthy competitors the westin is our favorite the staff is well trained and friendly unlike a competitor one block east the spa while under promoted and hidden down a hallway was fantastictwo thumbs way up to dora for the wonderful massages the rooms are spacious well maintained and of course the heavenly bedding is wonderful the only negative is that both the pool area and health club are in need of a face lift if not a makeover the gym has far too much equipment jambed into a small room off the pool if you use the treadmills which we both do youll feel like a sardine with the stranger next to you being only inches away im a retired pool builder so a little hypersensitive about pool areas but this is a residential size pool serving a large hotel so managing families with guests who like a quieter pool scene is difficult perhaps management can come up with a creative solution because if you like to lay around the pool have a beer and read a magazine then youll find the half a dozen screaming kids the parents of which do nothing to control just a little irritating the pool area itself is overdue for a serious cleaning the concrete decking was filthy some sling chairs need replacement and there were only enough terry cloth covers for about 6 of the chaise lounge chairs the bartender and bar were nice but westin needs to give this area some attention because while the hotel is 4 stars the pool area comes in around a 25 unless you spend 100 percent of your stay around the pool you wont be disappointed at the westin,5.0
beautiful old hotel beautifully maintained,"deserves four plus stars public spaces are magnificent and location is great  a block from the art institute around the corner fromthe symphony center and theaters and literally on several l lines
rooms can vary greatly in size we had a small king bedroom which was more than adequate but then were moved to a queen double with two  yes two bathrooms when we complained about the noise from the maids storage closet across the hall both rooms were on the executive floor which meant access to the lounge a real benefit because it means not having to pay downtown chicago prices for breakfast coffee or occasional snacks lounge was very crowded in the weekend a drawback but stilltolerable staff was exceptionally courteous and responsive we asked for and promptly got a change in rooms and when we had an allergic reaction to the feather pillow they were quickly replaced housekeeping is first rate from the room maids to the staff who keep the heavily used executive lounge clean and fresh 
we usually stay on or near the magnificant mile but were put up at the palmer house for a business meeting we had booked another hotel for the weekend but were so impressed with the palmer house that we cancelled the other reservation and stayed the weekend the palmer house is our new goto place in chicago",4.0
best location good value,the reason i chose this hotel was for the dupont circle location the best hotel choice ever 2 minute walk to the metro tons of restaurants bars coffee houses banks and a cvs store we were very happy with the hotel very clean comfortable room we got the superior king room with the city view on the 8th floor what a view best nights sleep ever bed was great the staff was friendly true there are no bar or restaurant in the hotel but why eat or drink in your hotel when you have dupont circle a few steps away we brought our own drinks to the rooftop pool and enjoyed the view the breakfast each morning was a great way to start the day we have already recommended the hotel to our friends we will stay here again on our next visit,4.0
good hotelgreat location,"we booked an 8 night stay in washington through hotwire requesting a hotel in dupont circle i was a little dissapointed when we were allocated the helix as many previous reviews stated that hotel was in area that had few attractionsi have to say that logan circle is a fantastic neighbourhood  we were delighted with our stay in the helix
okay the hotel is not next door to a metro stop but a pleasent 10 min walk will get you to a choice of 3 different stations  the system is a dream to use with probably the friendliest staff possiblethe helix is only a 15 min walk to the white house  10 minutes to dupont circlewe mostly used mc pherson square station as it is on the main line to the majority of the tourist attractionsa 39 7 day fast pass is great value for the metro 
the staff in the helix are extremely friendly  we were checked in by an very bubbly ashley who seemed to be there at every turn during our entire staydoes she ever get home our room was much larger than i expected with lovely comfortable bedding nice seating area  a compact but practical bathroomthe room colours werent as loud as i was expecting  you get used to them very quicklythe bar area was certainly funky  is a great change from the normal bland hotel barthe helix also serves complimentary coffee  tea at the bar in the mornings 
two minutes from the hotel there is a 7 eleven for the small goodies  1 block away there is a wholefood supermarket which also does a wonderful selection of cooked foods if you want a lazy night in your roomopposite the wholefoods there is a local bar stoneys which does a mean burger  next door the more upmarket logan tavern a lot of people seem to head to dupont circle for evening food but there is a great selection of restaurants closer to the helix on 14th street right up to the buzz of u streetchoices of americanitalianthai seafood ethiopianchinese etcthe area around the helix has a nice neighbourhood feel to it which comes alive in the evenings rather than some of the downtown areas that can be very quietwe certainly enjoyed our stay at the helix especially with the 109 hotwire price  loved our holiday in washington great city thanks",5.0

absolutely wonderful,when looking for a hotel in philly i reasearching using tripadvisor and they did not steer me wrong doubletree was an outsanding the staff was great they knew exactly how to explain where to go and the rooms were spotless the ac was cold the rooms were big the beds were very comfortable the bathrooms were clean and the location was perfect you are 1 block away from some outstanding bars and restaurants in the area the parking garage was connected and the blocks are shortnot like the long nyc blocks the hotel is about 5 miles from citizens bank park and in the arts district where it is clean and safe as an added bonus doubletree is only 1 mile from two of the most famous philly cheesesteak places pats and genos next time i go to philly i am going to go right for the doubletree very impressive and very reasonably prices you will not go wrong staying here,5.0
a cool oasis in humid ny,"booked on priceline 225 per night after reading the reviews i was prepared to be disappointed but this place is an oasis i called ahead to confirm we had a non smoking room and they told me to ask for an upgrade when i checked in and they would do it if it was available
when i arrived they promptly upgraded me yes the rooms are small but this is new york  anywhere central is going to be small the room was clean with good quality linens our room was renovated and i think all rooms are now at the w bathroom nice and clean and bright room was light with 2 big windows and a view down lexington very handy for the subway didnt order room service or dine there but reception and concierge very helpful and friendly this place is not at all pretentious housekeeping were friendly and did a very thorough job
this is a great place to base yourself in manhattan it was over 90 degrees in ny the weekend we stayed and returning to our quiet cool room at the w was perfect well above our expectations for the price definitely recommend it to others
the only thing id add is that it is always worthwhile asking for a room on a high floor just because there is always so much going on at street level in ny",4.0
relaxation,the front desk staff is very wonderful and helpful they renovation on the hotel and i still enjoy and had a relaxing time lily in the front desk gave a great room considering the renovation she is always smiling when i stay there ,5.0
loved this hotel,location on the waterfront but away from main city however 10 mins walk and youre in downtown or faneuil hall or 5 mins to south station t rooms are big and beds really comfy i had a club room with access to club lounge which was excellent concierge were great with restaurant recommendations and bookings,5.0
amazing customer service crusty hotel,my husband and i stayed here for our 5th wedding anniversary we wanted something in the heart of the city and relatively inexpensive  asking a lot we know this hotel fit the bill and was overall average for the cost it fit in with its surroundings  gritty dupont circle the first room we checked into was stinky and had some mildew on the ceiling customer service was fantastic  they upgraded our room and gave us two continental breakfast passes the second room was still a little damp smelling but dc had a lot of rain the past week  which might explain it regardless we love the kimpton hotels for their funky interior designs and fun amenities such as hosted wine hour cookies at night though we didnt see any the night we stayed and 10 in mini bar raiding for intouch members their membership program overall the hotel was a little crusty but in a fantastic location and with excellent service im not sure i would stay here again but my brand loyalty is still strong,3.0
great choice for new york city hotel,my husband and i spent 5 days at the lucerne on a leisure trip we selected the hotel based on its location upper west side and trip advisor reviews the lucerne is close to several museums we wanted to visit and to lincoln center and not too far from broadway theaters taxi fares were reasonable to all of these locations other reviewers had reported accurately on their experience at the lucerne the hotel itself is quiet very clean and with comfortable beds the staff was most helpful and pleasant i had to see a doctor on short notice and the hotel staff set up the appointment with their recommended doctor who took care of the problem the surrounding area has everything travelers would need  good restaurants a large drugstoreconvenience store across the street and many small shops selling coffee etc for breakfast or snacks,5.0
you get what you pay for,i will start out with the pros we arrived at the hotel at 200 pm and were given our room right away we got a newly renovated room and everything was very clean the elevators were pretty fast didnt have to wait a long time to get on them the staff at the concierge desk was very helpful in arranging a car to take us to the airport when we left location is excellent 5 minute walk to time square good walking distance to central park top of the rock and etc price was also a great deal now for the cons the room and bathroom were clean but there was a funky smell probably because theres no ventilation in the bathroom we tried calling the front desk several times but no one ever answered the phone we tried using the fast check out that appears on the telephone but it didnt work we checked out at noon and took our luggages to the luggage holding room and immediately the man asked for a tip i will most likely stay here again due to the great location and a good price,3.0
crummy location,very nice hotel in a really crummy area careful where you walk at night for a ritz we were expecting that the hotel would be among nice shops restaurants etc its near boston common and a few dunkin donuts and thats about it save a few bucks and stay in a better area like cambridge,4.0
good for a comfort inn,we felt this hotel was above standard for the comfort inn brand the room was very comfortable spacious and well equipped we had a car and the location was perfect for starting most of our la adventures the local area had many good restaurants and terrific fish taco stands good location for catching buses across town as well,3.0
pricey but great location,"this was a trendy hotel in the meatpacking district but is pretty pricey the rooms were minimalistically decorated but with a comfortable feel but be aware that there is a barpool on the top floor if you are trying to get a peaceful nights sleep on the weekends this is not where you want to stay as the place gets noisy with patrons going upstairs good for hotel guests as they do not charge to go up
the reception and concierge staff was very helpful in directing us to different spots to visit throughout the day and even suggested their own favorites in the city whiich was a suprise and very welcomed there was surely no signs of snobbish behavior as ive heard rumored from reading reviews of this place
gansevoort is in a great location to travel and explore in the neighborhoods around it with a group of friends for a short visit no so much for a family environment but definitely a great spot for couples and singles",4.0
terrible experience  as if the whole staff was novices,"stayed their for a training class for a few nights the experience was bad right off the bat when we pulled up at the hotel and the valet or doorman was no where to be found we waited a moment and then i went inside to find the doorman coming back from god knows where i asked him if he could grab a valet for my car and he said which car and i said the one thats sitting there there were no other cars other than mine no good evening or anything else from him he says its taken care of and doesnt hand me a ticket and gets in my car and drives off
the lobby is undergoing renovations which did nothing to improve my opinion of the place  so lesson here is  if you are undergoing renovations do whatever you can including good service to distract your guests from the fact that you are under renovations failed we go to the front desk and i begin checking in the agent seems confused and i tell him that i did not get a valet ticket and that confuses him even more he asks me who took my car and my colleague jokes some guy wearing a hoodie did so the agent tells me at ritzcarlton mind you that when i need my car i can just describe it to the valet and we can figure it out from there i told him that would not work and he would need to figure it out now we get that sorted out and i ask the agent a question i cant remember what exactly and there are now several other people in our area and he calls me by my last name and then in the same phrase gives my room number strike 2 the second rule of hotel security is you never give both of those out where someone can overhear it the first being you dont grant access to a room without verifying identity
the rest of the place looks good and the room is nice however for the remainder of my stay i never once got a bottle of shampoo in my amenities i did get two body washes and the first housekeeper didnt replenish my bottles while the next one did my last day they decided i shouldnt get a wall street journal either we also had to wait 30 minutes for our car to be delivered from valet the first night
knowing this i was prepared for check out now the hotel knew since our group had booked a majority of the rooms that we were all checking out en masse this day so i called ahead 30 minutes in advance to have my car pulled up and i told my colleague we would rush to get our luggage from bell before anyone else had a chance i knew ritz would somehow screw up our attempt to make it to the airport on time well thats where they got us at the bell stand my luggage was available but they had brought my colleagues up to another floor and he had to wait 15 minutes for his luggage while i sat on broad street waiting in the car dialing furiously to get ritz customer service  which the hotel understood as the sales department at that hotel who then fumbled to deliver me to the main marriott switchboard in maryland who then delivered me to someones voicemail wow either you dont have enough problems to be organized on that front or you just dont care
ritz carlton you have nothing on four seasons or kimpton except for a regal name and an impressive looking logo well see how long that will hold you up you have lost my business indefinitely",2.0
a great place to stay right in heart of fells point the staff is fun effecient and welcoming,"this was our third stay during the fells point fun festival we cant imagine having the same experience for our girls weekend anywhere else 
one tip we learned is to self park your car instead of paying 60 plus tip for the weekend we paid 23 on sunday the streets are closed so you have to walk to your car anyway 
check in was quick and service was awesome we were able to get the room we requested and had a refrigerator within minutes 
the entire staff was fun helpful and always met our requests",5.0
over the top in convenience and comfort,our mary kay group had a wonderful comfortable and convenient stay at your hotel we loved the complimentary shuttle service and breakfast buffet every day the staff was the best i have ever experienced in my 30 years of travelling with mary kay we will return again next year for sure,5.0
exceedingly average,"i stay at a lot of courtyard marriotts while on business i would never book one to stay at for a personal vacation and this one is definitely not one of the better locations
first the area is covered in strip malls i guess that could be ok if thats youre thing one side of the hotel does have a mountain view in the distance while the other side overlooks a hooters my room was very clean and otherwise comfortable
breakfast is not included at this location as it is with other courtyard marriotts that could be an issue with the business that negotiated my rate the breakfast is good not great and the hotel does not offer room service 
the elevators are very loud my room was about 3 rooms away from the elevators and i could hear them all night the most annoying thing was waking up early the day i was leaving to go to the airport and no hot water 
given some of the unique locations to stay in denver this is not high on my list if youre a business traveler with no choice then you could do worse the free internet does work",2.0
top shelf business travel hotel,great location to the energy belt west of houston super clean hotel good food in the resturant and the happy hour that seems to extend beyond the normal 2 hours is great the bartender does a great job and really hustles very clean and well equipped work facility as well,5.0
my very last stay at the 60 thompson,i am currently staying at the 60 thompson i was mucky enough to stay in this hotel when it was very new the staff still committed and enthusiastic these days are gone the staff looks utterly demotivated does barely notice you i was not given a hello when i arrived at reception for check in i had to say hello the person had me wait for 8 minutes to come back and say that i had to be downgraded as my room was taken by a guest that had extended his stay no apologies no effort whatsoever this hotel still benefits from a undeserved glow of trendiness and quality i strongly recommend not to go this hotel any longer,2.0
charming and great location,just a few steps away from central park and 5th avenue the surrey brings alive culture and sophistication with their classic modern european style the staff was so welcoming and gave friendly personal service the breakfast in the hotels restaurant was fabulous we travel a lot in many states and countries we highly recommend the th surrey and consider it our home hotel when we visit nyc,5.0
close enough to everything far enough to breath,booked the night before on a whim for a layover on my honeymoon it is under a mile from the start of the walk of fame my wife and i were sketical thay we could find a hollywood hotel for 107 a night but were pleasantly surprised easy to grt to from the hollywoodvine metro nice pool clean room great food at the 101 diner downstairs,4.0
avoid this hotel,"the official pictures obviously look more nice than as it is
i got a very dark hotel room to the backside of the hotelpretty dark
in addition the noise level in the night from the backyard was really annoying
in addition to that there are union protesters running in circles in front of the hotels
almost each day for hours google for boycott hotel frank in order to get more background
they even protested on the weekend between 7 and 8am
in addition my office chair was broken and has not been replaced
there are better options around union square",2.0
new hotel but not maintained well,"stayed here for 5 nights due to its proximity to canal st but i wouldnt stay here the next time i visit new york simply it is located in not nice neighborhood also the hotel alone looks new but not well maintained though 
the staff was friendly at least they tried but you can still sense the forcefulness of the staff trying to be friendly its better but you need to hire more staff thats friendly in their core character but anyways the room is typical sheraton but i was surprised with the lack of sports equipment when i used the gym 
again i will choose another starwood hotels the next time i visit new york",3.0
terrific service,my husband and i stayed with our two kids ages 6 and 8 at this wyndham in may 2011 and were impressed by the staffs effort to make us comfortable and happy there is free wifi for all guests which is a lovely perk to staying here in addition we wanted to save money by eating cereal with the kids in the mornings and the staff quickly borrowed bowls and spoons for us from the restaurant downstairs and stored our milk in the employee fridge each night and delivered it to us each morning the staff is great,5.0
outstandingly helpful staff,stayed here for one night whilst en route to fort worth hotel currently being renovated which will no doubt mean a great improvement as the generously sized rooms are slightly dated decorwise though the bed was supercomfortable location is convenient to the us35 but far enough away not to be noisy all the staff we encountered were superhelpful and friendly to us a nice change in a chain hotel  thank you bar meal and breakfast food were very good dining room is cold and souless but presumably will be improved after the refit a brief but very enjoyable stay,4.0
outstanding guest services,"not only is dury inn beautiful and perfectly located but the guest services are the quality of a 5 star hotel after checking out june 2012 and returning home i discovered i had left my wallet in the room i was catching a flight the next day but martha in the guest services found a courier that would deliver my precious id and credit cards the same day 
her follow up call confirming the shipment eased and otherwise stressed out day thank you martha",5.0
false information on website and customer service,"we had two problems 1 major and 1 minor
minor problem
i called the hotel the day before to find out how i could get a shuttle in the airport they said they had a courtesy phone in the airport but i couldnt find their phone the info desk told me they had discontinued their phone because they did not pay i had to call them myself i was on roaming it was pretty expensive for me as they had to contact the driver to find out when he could come while i was on hold
major problem
we did not have a car with us it said on the website that they had a restaurant thats the deciding factor on whether we would pick this hotel as there is no restaurant within walking distance we found out the restaurant was closed on arrival the staff told us they could shuttle us to olive garden we first waited 15 mins for the shuttle when we arrived we found the resturant was full and the waiting time was an hour but the shuttle was gone and we could not go anywhere else when we finally finished dinner i tried to call them for a pickup i was put on hold for at least 15 mins while they were looking for the driver i was on roaming and it was very expensive so i hanged up i asked another hotel guest in the restaurant to call this time he got connected and told us we had to wait 15 min the driver ended up coming in about 20 mins we spent the whole night waiting and trying to get a shuttle i will never stay in this hotel again",2.0
perfect location,the location of this hotel could not be any more ideal it is directly across from central parkso perfect for grabbing a coffee  taking a nice stroll we got into town early  we were able to get into our room at 100 two hours before official check in highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a more relaxed nyc experience the only drawback to our stay here was the 11 apple juice i had ordered in for my daughter other than that great place  great location,4.0
superb locationquaint rooms with a great view,"our goal was to experience new york as a new yorker and not a tourist the location of ci was fantasticlocated in a residential neighborhood one half block away from central park we arrived on the memorial day holidaynew yorkers were everywhere sunning themselves jogging eating lunch and drinking beer down at the pier on the hudson take a right out of the hotel and walk straight down towards the hudson river outdoor tables beer and good food available 
yes the shower water ran hot and cold more of a problem in the winter months and the toilet seat was loose but the windows on the 14th floor opened and we had a birds eye view of people lounging in their roof top patios we had very warm weather during our stay but the air conditioner worked the wifi was included and we were able to grab a coffee and bagel before we headed out for the day there was a manager lady whom we did not get her name but she was always friendly and would acknowledge us leaving and entering the hotel
i did check for bed bugsfound not a one not to say that there arent any in this hotel but they were not in our room on the 14th flr new york city has experienced a surge in bed bugs and they are found in even 5 star hotels and yes the elevator is slowthere is only one so be prepared to walk the stairs if you are in a hurry or wait patiently for its arrival
overall i am grateful for having read the reviews regarding the size of the room and the slow elevator knowing these things helped to prepare our frame of mind
i would definitely recommend if you are not in need of a luxurious hotel experience and just need a clean quiet and comfy place to sleep and shower another plus is that the bed was very comfy and linens were soft and clean",3.0
great location bad ac,spent several nights at the river hotel on both business and a fun weekend trip with my wife we have always loved the hotels restaurant bella bacinos so we tried the hotel the room was not as small as i thought it would be from other reviews the motif of the room is contemporary with pocket doors for the bathroom tile bath and a very usable and updated work desk the ac was negligible ironically the hall was ac all the way if you need an iron and board just ask because there was none in the room service was good but the optimum reason to choose the river is the location we have traveled to chicago on at least 20 occasions have stayed at numerous hotels but wacker street is the central location to michigan ave shopping and the great little restaurants in the loop you would probably want to taxiit to rush and division but it is walkable on a great day they will park for 45 per but there is a tiny little lot that is public parking next to the hotel for 28 our car was safe and i could grab things from the trunk at my leisure i liked it better than valet all in all i received a great value on the at 119 when compared to other area hotels like 71 and swissotel i would recommend the river hotel and will always recommend the deep dish pizza and portabello appetizer at bellas just make sure you check the ac first,4.0
wonderful experience,we stayed at the st regis in washington dc last weekend everyone was so friendly the desk staff bartender and the restaurant staff everyone had a smile and a kind word the room was lovely and the lobby is gorgeous we enjoyed talking with the bartender and exchanged recipes for bloody marys the food in the restaurant was wonderful they gave us a cheesy puff pastry to start as well as an amuse bouche even after ordering dessert they brought chocolates and maccaroons the lobster appetizer was exquisite and the iberian jamon reminded us of spain the manager ammar samad spent time with us as we departed and wanted to be sure everything went well with our stay he was very kind to us and we enjoyed talking with him we live close to dc and like to try different hotels in dc on weekends this was such a great experience that we know we will return often,5.0
acme hotel,excellent hotel it is an old chicago hotel that has be updated completely  was the old comfort inn good wifi room size for a standard king is 200 sq feet small compared to newer hotels you can get larger rooms paid 1167 per night for the room booked directly with the hotel they have a good app for smart phone located on ohio st 2 blocks from mi ave great location rooms quiet interior rooms have windows but no view just a hotel core overlooking other buildings  old tokyo hotel  will stay again if yoyu want larger room book suite they are 2 rooms together with a wall removed double the space and 2 tvs,5.0
we liked it and well be back,"we stayed at the hampton inn for a night the hotel has a nice hall with comfortable sofa and armchairs staff was friendly and helpful the checkin was 23 minutes
we asked for a quiet clean room and high floor the front desk stuff gave us a room on the fourth floor we got a room according to our request the room was clean and everything worked well it was not refrigerator in the 2 double beds room the 2 double beds were comfortable we were sleeping well
we enjoyed the free hot buffet breakfast which was typically an egg dish yogurts instant oatmeal fresh fruits muffins and bagels only a waffle maker did not work properly the outside swimming pool was open from 800 am but it was too small to swim there here were a lot of leaves there nobody did clean the pool from them
the hotel has free parking with a lot of parking lots there 
overall is a nice place to stay for the price location and friendliness
we will definitely return the next time were in town",4.0

location location location,my husband  i spent two days at this holiday inn before our panama canal cruise the hotel is right on the boardwalk directly across the street from the cruise terminal so all you have to do is walk across the street with luggage in hand to the terminal the uss midway aircraft carrier museum is half a block to your left from the hotel  the hop on  hop off tour bus is less distance than that from the hotel anthonys seafood restaurant is also across the street to your right slightly the hotel itself is clean excellent servicecomfortable beds and the rooms are good size if  when we go back to san diego we will definitely stay there again,5.0
decent rooms but extortionate parking charges and slow service,we stayed here for three nights in june 2011 on arrival we were shocked by the price the hotel was charging for parking 36 per night although we found parking garages a few blocks away which charge 10 per night or 15 per night at weekends our room was good and was functional although it was lacking tea coffee making facilities the bathroom was a triumph of style over function with the raised sink being inconvenient and the sliding door not giving much privacy we tried to get a drink in the poolside bar but we had to wait so long for service that we gave up we also had to wait an age in the downstairs bar and to check out i am not convinced there were enough staff on duty for a hotel of its size the rooms and facilities are generally good but the services and extra charges are not,3.0
great hotel at a reasonable price,we had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for our nieces wedding the weekend of july 20th it was very clean and since we had an interior room very quiet the front staffsue and tony were so helpful getting us cabs and suggesting restaurants to eat at that were within our budget my husband and i were so happy that the next time we visit san fran we plan on staying here again close to fishermans wharf russian hill union street with its eclectic shops this hotel even offers free covered parking for its guests and visitors did i mention that this hotel is a winner and the rooms were huge also provided lots of freebies in the form of maps guides etc,5.0

great locationbut looooud,if youre looking to be in the middle of all the memphis action this is the hotel for you from shopping to restaurants to the night life on beale you cant get any better having said this if you value staying in a room that provides an expected amount of quietness then you do not want to be in a room that faces 3rd ave there is a park across the street where local blues bands set up and play loudly until 1100pm or later  well after midnight on the weekends after my first night in a room facing 3rd i asked to be moved to a room that does not suffer from this and was much happier the customer service in this hotel is average to aboveaverage the rooms bedding and bathroom the same,4.0

great hotel,on arrival hotel was easily found and in a nice location we had reserved a king room two months in advance but on arrival they stated that we had been upgraded to a suite which we found out only has a queen size bed we stated that we wanted a king room and did not want the suite we were told there was not a king available which we did not like to hear that after a two month notice one of the night managers heard our discussion and that we were not satisfied with the upgrade and amazingly he managed to find us a king room we were completely satisfied and thanked him and he took us to our room i had heard all of the small room stories in new york and did not know what to expect since this was my first visit the room was extremely nice and a very nice size so the photos on line were accurate we had one of the lights above the bed that was out and no wash cloths but other than that i would relate our stay excellent the room had been updated and was clean the sink in the bathroom was a little small but it was updated and clean our bed was very comfortable which was nice after a long day we never had a problem getting an elevator and we were on the 10th floor the elevators are small but were quick getting to our floor this is a nice hotel that when we return to new york we would like to stay at again especially with the location and easy access to the subway it is nice that they are offering the buy two nights and get the third free which is a nice savings dont pass this one up,4.0

great staff and hotel,we have stayed at the sutton place for several years and think of it as our home away from home when visiting our son in chicago the staff is the most welcoming group of people we feel like royalty each and every time we stay there it is in a wonderful location with shopping nearby and lots of places to eat right there the beach on lake michigan is easily within walking distance the rooms are wonderful with great views but for us the people are the best asset of the sutton place hotel in chicago ,5.0
standard hyatt hotel in a good location,this hyatt is very large and i agree with the other reviews about it serving mostly as a convention hotel there were at least three meetings ongoing during my stay they charge a fortune for everything eg  food internet even in the lobby or meeting room areas parking room rate the service is fine and the rooms are fine but nothing extraordinary in fact the rooms are not at all sound proof you can hear conversations easily from the hallway or the in the rooms next door and street noise but i was lucky to have courteous neighbors the location is greatwalking distance to restaurants museums shopping millenium park bus lines and more overall i might stay here again but i might look for other hotels that are less expensive in the area in the future,4.0
classy,"just recommended by a friend we decided to go for it and venture into the unknown world of an unsearchable hotelwhat a pleasant surprise
first the room at the junior suite was tuck away in a sort of corner in the room nice and dark for sleeping in with he bathroom located next to it for conveniencewith a little balcony tat although face the street was amazingly quiet
the best were the bedswow  it was better than any other high priced hotel i have stayed and i have traveled all over the world
clean and cozy room service was quick and the food was still warm when delivered 
the appointments in the room were much more than the price demanded and we loved the quality and abundance of towels
staff was helpful and courteous
our stay was so pleasant that we came back a week later and got a suite looking over the marina again wow  everything was detailed and the two balconies provided much room outside to bbq and the like
the kitchen however was a little lacking in some cooking essentials and more were requested and delivered one thing  although the grounds are meticulous maintained the paint below the kitchen counterbar was thin and peeling off from the wall an unnatural sight on this sea of detailed attention
we are returning to say the least

an ordeal,my sister booked this hotel based on location i was put in room 109 two twin beds miserably uncomfortable old matresses tv looked like something bought at a yard sale old carpet and the view can only be described as prison yard complete with bars when i went to bed the first night the room was stuffy and i looked for the climate control finally called the front desk and was told the controls were in another room and it was too late to call and ask them to regulate the temperature in fairness the next day i moved in with my sister in room 306 two large full beds comfortable matresses and two lovely large windows overlooking 16th street the front desk personnel ranged from disinterested to rude i am an experienced traveler third world included and this is one of the worst hotel experiences ive had in a long time when i paid my bill for my one miserable night i felt totally ripped off ps no parking,2.0
comfortable in a great location,"things we liked the location was excellent near ucla in a safe environment the valet guys pointed out a free parking space that enabled us to avoid one night of valet fees  now that is great service quiet and comfortable room the decor is interesting and stylish we were able to sleep two adults and two children ages 8 and 5 without a problem when we asked for extra towels they were delivered within a few minutes
a quibble the toilets flush loudly and i could hear flushing from other rooms very minor issue but thought i should mention it
we did not take advantage of the wine hour the restaurant or the pool  maybe next time wed definitely stay here again if the price was right",4.0
bedbugs and scabies,"on my first day a dead cockroach being consumed by teeming fire ants on the hallway floor leading to my room was an omen dont stay here get a real hotel stay at the hilton by the airport youll be glad you spent the extra money just think you could bring home a lovely reminder of your visit to dfw bedbugs or whats that itchy feeling everyone seems to have oh its scabies awesome 
otherwise rooms are miniscule and infested with ants bedbugs and god knows what else and what the heck is that smell nursing home and cat pee mildew and insecticide the food really isnt bad and the kitchen staff is very friendly but just in case you got your hopes up they only serve dinner until 7 pm the location stinksthere are no immediately available amenities other than the airport and logically aa md80s are constantly flying overhead so loud you cant even have a conversation the airports radio frequency interferes with the television signalevery once in a while the screen looks epileptic and makes a terrible blipping sound when the tv does work you only get about 15 channels and the picture quality is terrible because the tubes are outdated consistently malfunctioning wifi is great when you need to get work done too

there was poop on the bathroom walls,not only were the tiles falling from the ceiling the exhaust fan in the bathroom was hanging out and there was poop on the bathroom walls my family came for a visit and refused to stay there after they entered the room and now they cant get a refund from priceline or the hotel do not stay here even if you just plan to spend a little time in the room,1.0
loved the staff and excellent service,"i love the hotel the general manager was extremely nice so were all the hotel staff members i had complementery breakfasts every morning priority club and complementery fruit baskets every week for staying there the gym is pretty good however the equipment tended to break down though the management would fix it quickly the location isnt the best but the orpheum theatre is close by so people walk around all the time the hotel is also really close to the bart civic center station which is very convenient for anyone who would like to travel via bart
i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting sf",5.0
hilton chicago,"the hilton chicago hotel located on south michigan hotel is a lovely old historical hotel graced by former us presidents and queen elizabeth the entrance lobby from south michigan avenue is ornate in neoclassical style i had a room on the 20th floor executive floor and it was clean comfortable and with all the facilities of a deluxe hotel at the time of my stay the executive lounge on the 24th floor was closed for renovation 
the hotel is a short 10 minute walk to the harrison red line station and just opposite grant park i would certainly recommend the chicago hilton to any visitor to chicago",4.0
great room pool area value and location,this hotel was a great value there was a promotion that included the breakfast buffet so to get the room breakfast and free parking at a location near the riverwalk we were quite pleased the decor in the lobby has a contemporary look with lots of televisions and a couple of computers we loved the pool areait had lots of chairs and loungers along with a nice waterfall and a big pergola with even more chairs it was really a nice setup lots of pool towels were available in the pool area the room was also very nice and clean the cookies are really yummy too,5.0
wonderful place to stay very convenient,"when we checked in the staff was very willing to give us directions to all the attractions we planned to visit they gave us information regarding public transportation and tips on restaurants and must dos the room was very large and even though we were next to the interstate suprisingly quiet covered parking was an extra plus breakfast was hot and plentiful

a great exchange in new york  would definitely request again,a very convenient location for times square and all midtown destinations and less than one block away from the subway we had a one bedroom suite which was just right for our family of four the walls however seemed quite thin or we just happened to have very loud neighbours as we could clearly hear what was being said next door on a couple of occasions yes there was a 25 a day hospitality charge however there was free internet coffee tea and popcorn was replenished daily and if you were around free hot drinks and cookies in the members lounge in the afternoon before arriving we received at least four invitations to the rci presentation which we duly ignored on site we received one written invitation and one call about this we declined and were left to enjoy the rest of our stay,5.0
taking advantage of fire evacuees,"my wife and i were evacuated from the san diego wild fires in october when we checked out of the hotel we found a charge for local calls 1 was for 20 for 30 minutes while calling my insurance company to get help for fire damage and lodging expenses the other calls were for less than 30 seconds and were to reassure friends and family we were safe the phone charges were 2 and 3 for each 30 second call
i contacted the manager but he never bothered to call back to explain why they took advantage of fire victims",2.0
great location and value near penn station and empire state,"my daughter  i spent one night at this hotel in october chosen for the location very near to penn station and transportation as well as it being part of the hilton family it was a bit hidden as we approached and the next day was obviously garbage day so the first impression wasnt great and our cab driver almost missed it but we were welcomed warmly even at a late hour we were thoroughly surprised that our room had a view of the empire state building very impressive lit up at night 
i was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the quality quantity and variety of complimentary full american breakfast options and the helpfulness and friendliness of the serving staff we checked our luggage in order to enjoy a day of shopping and it was retrieved quickly and easily when we wanted it for location and value id highly recommend this hotel and would stay again",4.0
what a treasure will definitely stay here again,"this hotel is a real gem the location on the river is great and sitting outside in the morning or afternoon on the river bank is wonderfully relaxing 
the rooms are clean organized well and attractive nice large bathroom comfortable bed the staff is very friendly and efficient i read another comment about slow elevators and was really surprised we were there on a busy weekend and the elevators were quite prompt we also stayed on the 6th floor the only negative about the elevators is that the voice announcing floors etc is a bit annoying you do have to pay for internet and my question not just for this hotel is why do the higher priced hotels charge for internet access and the cheaper ones provide it free
restaurant and bar is good we had drinks and appetizers in the bar and breakfast in the dining room and were pleased with both 
the hotel is wonderfully situated with comfortable quiet rooms couldnt ask for more",5.0

do not stay here  carpet and ceiling stains,"staying here is a bad idea i stayed here for business and wish i hadnt the first room i checked into had horrible carpet stains everywhere lo and behold when i looked up there was a huge stain on the ceiling i was the top floor 
i asked for another room this one was no better more carpet stains and dresser was so chipped i could barely see the fake wood the third room had no ceiling stain some carpet not as severe and i was too tired to try another room

the only thing that saves this property is alizee restaurant,i stayed at this property as part of a new years eve package that included a 5course dinner at alizee and 5900 for a king size suite the dinner and service at alizee was impeccable as was the case when we dined there for thanskgiving however the doubletree checkin service left much to be desired the gentleman who checked us in was unimpressive and we simply felt unwelcomed the room was acceptable but we were disappoined that the king size suite did not contain a refrigerator as is custom in all of the hilton king suites ive stayed on new years day we awoke to barely have hot water to shower and used it as an opportunity to share a shower i reviewed my bill to find i was charged 2499 for valet service that was included as a part of the package this was removed from my bill again by a staff member who again was unfriendly and seemed bothered by my request to have the charge removed as a hilton honors status member not a property i would ever recommend,3.0
nice hotel with exceptional service  location,"staying here on business and am impressed by the exceedingly cordial staff the room itself is nice but not exceptional i am actually a bit overwhelmed by what i refer to as the alice in wonderland decor  gold and purple walls green and purple carpet green doors highbacked abstractly shaped chairs etc it is a bit like something out of wonderland although one of my colleagues swears it reminds him of south beachthe bathroom is nonexceptional  combination showertub nice long counter and typical lousy hairdryer i so wish hotels would give consideration to their female clientele there are no refrigerators in the rooms but when i requested one it was promptly brought up for me the king size bed is comfortable and includes a multitude of pillows of varying firmness and fill my hvac unit is on the noisy side with no option for continuous fan but this is also not uncommon in older roomsthe breakfast buffet is typically overpriced 12 for fruit cereal pastry etc however the fresh berries are a nice touch blueberries strawberries blackberries  all available again the service was very attentive lastly on week nights there is crabby happy hour that consists of homemade crab dip and free beerwine the crab dip was great i think that the chefs was good but dj  did a better job by adding mustard for a kick and made for a super appetizer 
considering the location on the innerharbor excellent service and more than adequate room i would gladly stay here again",5.0
loved the tub but there are some quirks,we were intrigued by the japanese hydrotherapy suites so we opted to spend a bit more to try it out since the tubs when fully filled weigh a lot we expected to be on the ground floor and we were the tub was fantastic as was the rain showerhead but the one downside was that the tub is basically right next to the bed no biggie just be prepared we thought it would be in the separate bathroom area but it wasnt also for some reason the bathroom wall shower  toilet didnt reach completely to the ceiling thus every sound made in the bathroom could be heard in the room its not a big deal for couples i guess but if youre bunking with a friend or family member just be aware of that otherwise the hotel was nice and clean service was fine although after the first night the cleaning staff took the hotelprovided robes and didnt replace them and didnt refill the inroom coffee supplies the continental breakfast at the adjoining restaurant was initially a bonus for us but it left much to be desired it consisted of singleserve cereals toastenglishmuffinbagels which you toasted yourself at the end of the buffet often resulting in a long wait oatmeal hardboiled eggs a couple of fruit choices yoplait yogurt juice and coffee after day one we opted for the starbucks across the street oh one other quick note  the hotel does have highspeed internet but only if you have a wireless card we thought they might have ethernet cables but there was no option for that so we had to upload our vacation photos on dialup needless to say we decided to wait until we got home and just bought an extra media card for our camera instead,3.0
honesty goes a long way,we just returned from a 3 day stay and this is the first time i have written a review hotel is in a great location right in the middle of times square but once you are inside it is peaceful and tranquil unlike other ts hotels ive stayed at the rooms were clean and although there is traffic noise it did not keep my family up here is the best part of my review i had left 2 very expensive designer handbags at the hotel we called the next day after realizing it and spoke with alex in security they had them the staff were amazing during our trip to ny but nothing is better for someone to know when booking a hotel that the staff not only can tell you the best way downtown but are honest,4.0
great place to stay,i would stay here again the oldest continuosly running hotel in the nation this historic hotel is still beautiful and very well taken care of the staff is very friendly and helpfulwe stayed for a week and loved the location it is in the midst of the freedom trail and a short walk away from quincy market historic landmarks the north end cheers and more we walked everywhere,5.0
like an old lady that needs facelift,"i booked this hotel through hotwire where it was rated as 4 star if this hotel is a 4 star then the ritz carlton is a 7 star the star rating has become the most misused guide to a hotel but in my book a 4 star hotel has ammeneties in the hotel not a bolt on restaurant and bar as this does 
but i digress check in was busy and one poor lady was handling eveything a common theme in other revies so check in was slow several people came in after me and eventually the second reception desk was opened now the lady was very polite and checked myslef and my colleague into 1608 and 1708 bearing in mind the 2 rooms were booked via hotwire alarm bells went ringing in my head that the xx08 rooms are reserved for those patrons booking a discounted room type my fears were confirmed when right when the lift door opened across a very narrow corrdor was 1608 
on opening the poorly fitting door i entered a small room that could be described as european  at least based on its size same could be said for the bathroom both have nice furnishings but this room would be unsuitable for 2 people the metal framed window let in quite a bit of noise as did the door to the corridor  between the 2 it was a noisy room  light sleepers look elsewhere
bathroom ameneties were quality and of a wide selection plenty of hot water and the bed was comfortable with fine sheets there was a fake 8 plant jammed between the tv and the work desk  covered in dust  really come on 4 star
the restaurant is not part of the hotel but can be accessed through the hotel on the way you pass a beautifully appointed bar that is closed what an opportunity missed

sisters in the city,this was a great hotel for the price we paid the location is really close to the theatres of times square and the lobby and staff are very friendly and accomodating the room was pretty large for new york standards and average in quality,4.0
the horror,"i got a room for 189 and after spending a night in this dump i suggest you keep your money and find a nice park bench instead this hotel might have been nice 50 years ago when they last likely renovated it they are understaffed i had to wait in line for over 45 minutes to check in the room while decent sized had dirty carpet and walls not painted in several years the furniture was old cheap banged up and i had a table in the room that shook every time i typed on my laptop it was so flimsy the room smelled of stale smoke and the bathroom had cracked tiles bad plumbing and a toilet that was bolted to the floor crooked so that you couldnt sit on it squarely
it boots a free breakfast ha you go to the 12th floor to a former room that has a few tables set up where you can pour yourself a glass of bad oj a tray with few rolls on it and a tv in the corner with a few seats around a bad joke doesnt even begin to describe it 
stay away from this place if you have any standards at all",1.0
the staff was so polite,my family and i stayed here for 2 nights so my son could have medical tests at john hopkins it was cheap and convenient to the downtown after my sons test he vomited all over the floor in the lobby and one of the staff members rushed right over to help he was so sweet and cleaned it right up they were so helpful and we were able to rest quietly it wasnt the most modern in the rooms but the fridge was a great plus i would definately recommend this hotel,4.0
lots of fungreat location,we were able to get a great price using the priceline site and thoroughly enjoyed a couple very busy days in chicago we joined the chicago architectural foundation since we wanted to go on several walking tours as well as the river cruise the tours are free to members and the river cruise discounted all were very informative and enjoyable we walked 29000 steps the first day and needless to say needed to tone it down the second day the planetarium and art institute were fabulous  looking forward to getting back soon,5.0

cool hotel but why doublecharge for internet,this is a great hotel with comfortable rooms lively bar and excellent restaurant but i was charged twice for inroom internet access because i used both my laptop and my ipad its bad enough being charged at all for a service they provide for free in the lobby but to be doublecharged puts the w in ifi  charge,4.0
found my new business hotel in nyc,"after a few not so great experiences at the hotel i normally stay at while in nyc i took advantage of jetsetters sale to obtain a room at the surrey for an unbeatable rate to see if i should make the surrey my new business hotel the first thing that raised my eyebrows about the surrey was that it doesnt have the same buzz as some of the other hotels in its category such as the park plaza st regis or athenee however as i came to find the surrey was every bit as luxurious as some of the other boutique hotels but without the crowds and traffic
i will say that i probably wont be booking the surrey when using jetsetter again because it was a total logistical nightmare normally with my busy schedule it is very hard to follow up on a hotel booking but it seemed that the surrey was having some major issues with the jetsetter site because it took at least 7 emails back and forth with the very helpful gm spencer to lock down the day i needed as jetsetter kept saying it was unavailable and would not show the reservation i was told there were some issues with the hotels reservation computer system which might have accounted for the glitch
however once i actually got to the surrey all the hassle i went through making the reservation was worth it i was upgraded to a fantastic room with a small sitting area and plenty of space the hotel staff couldnt have been any nicer or friendlier one of the ways i always judge a hotel is by how the staff treats the guests from the desk clerks to the doormen to the gm himself you will be treated as a valued guest here and the staff will go out of the way for you if you make a request
the thing that stood out the most to me was the bed it was amazing  without a doubt the best bed ive had at any hotel in nyc it had extremely nice bedding including one of the nicest down comforters ive seen  i forgot to ask where i could buy one when i was checking out of the hotel i was only there for one night during a worldwind schedule so its too bad i did not get to use it more there are plenty of pillows as well which are not too firm or soft
the room is very tastefully decorated normally i do not love grey white and black color schemes because i feel they are not very warm and semidepressing however the surrey did it right the room felt classy and comfortable without feeling too blah the bathroom was also one of the biggest ive had in nyc with a nice shower that had a great double head and awesome water pressure the marble and mosaic made it feel very classy the toiletries were nice and plentiful
one thing i did not use that i thought was cool was instead of the nipsized bottles in the typical minibar  the surrey offers bottle service in the room for 45  55 you can buy a 350 ml bottle of liquor enough for 34 drinks and a bartender will come to your room with the mixers etc and mix your first round and leave you the accoutramonts for the other drinks you will make there are about 15 different drinks you can choose to go with depending on the bottle you choose
the location is great those who want to be closer to broadwaytimes square would not want to walk there and back as it took 30 minutes at a fairly brisk pace to make it to broadway it is a short cabride to that area and they are pretty good about calling you a cab because this hotel is fairly removed from the action so cabs arent plentiful the location is in a residential part of central park 5th avenue and madison avenue are only a 10 minute walk and because it is so close to central park the walk is not bad i prefer staying here as opposed to staying more in the action because it is very quiet and laid back  not at all hustle and bustle it almost feels like being in a residential neighborhood which is probably why the price is a bit higher than some comparable hotels
i found the rates to be reasonable  midapril seemed to be in the 400  500 range for a standard room you could stay at the w for much less but i wouldnt say the two are comparable in terms of the luxury beddingservice however the vibe is similar one thing i didnt like as much is that if you are traveling with a business partner they do not have many rooms available at the entry level price range with two beds i was told upon checking in the only room they had available with two beds was a junior suite which would cost 795 per night the regular rate for an entry level room was 495 at the time
i did not use the restaurant or bar at the hotel the lobby isnt as spacious as it looks on the website however it isnt as busy as a lot of other hotels so that isnt really a problem i did notice that the staff at this hotel do not beg for tips as they do at a lot of the other full service hotels in the area at many hotels i stay at for business it seems like one person takes your bags out of the car one person wheels them into the hotel one person parks the car and another person takes the bags to the room i didnt really find that at the surrey i was at the barclay during this trip as well and was literally chased down into the street by a bellman who moved my bags from my room a few hours earlier who wanted to let me know that it was him that moved my bags earlier that morning
if you have some money to spend and enjoy being outside of the action in a more laid back area the surrey is for you i will say that after several years of staying at their nearby rival hotel i am making the surrey my new home for business travel in nyc i would describe my stay here as luxurious and relaxing and thank the staff and gm for making my businesspersonal trip so enjoyable",5.0
great hotel in good area,we stayed at this hotel the week of may 21 the hotel is very nice and i felt in a convenient location to times square only like 2 blocks the rooms are nice bath a little small but the area is not loud and if you have your window closed you cant even hear the traffic the only complait i would say is that the elevators never seemed to be working and when you have been walking all around the city it was a little like oh i am tired anyway overall i would stay at this hotel again definately,4.0
perfect nyc base,i loved this hotel our room a studio suite was spacious by nyc standards spotless and very comfortable the location was great for us being away from the frantic pace of times square but close enough to walk there there is a multitude of great restaurants and bars within a stones throw of the hotel the staff were super friendly i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a midpriced hotel for a stay in ny,5.0
fabulous clean hotel with great staff,"the running theme in the reviews for this hotel are about the small rooms and mine was no exception only about 24 inches surrounding the twin bed on all 3 sides and had to step over the toilet to enter and exit the shower however i cant say there wasnt enough room for my luggage or toiletries the small armoire provided plenty of room to hang my clothes and there were lots of electrical outlets available to charge my cell camera battery mp3 player etc
the room was spotless and the maid did an excellent job daily the down comforter and pillows were comforting after long tiring days sightseeing and the sheets were always sparkling white and crisp
the staff was super friendlycant recall one instance where i passed by a staff member when i wasnt greeted with a smile and friendly hello they were superquick with special requests and seemed genuinely happy to help with their knowledge of the city
the view from the room was a dark ugly airshaft but i saw this as a plus because it kept out street noise which along with the thick walls between rooms made for a very quiet stay
my only complaint about the wj was that one day during my 4 night stay they turned off the water for maintenance with no notice and i was caught halfway through my shower with no water pressure i see this as a minor inconvenience and isolated incident that would not keep me from staying at the wj again",4.0
great hotel and excellent location,"we just got back from our trip to san diego yesterday we stayed at the marriott in the gaslamp and have nothing but good things to say about this hotel
you really cant beat the location it is 2 miles to the san diego zoo 5 miles to sea world and petco park is adjacent to the hotel there are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance the altitude bar on the top of the hotel is great we could only go up during the day because we had the kids with us but it overlooks petco park so you can watch the game from there you can also look into the park from the concierge lounge
we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the concierge floor i am not sure why we were upgraded other than that my husband is a silver or maybe gold not sure marriott rewards member but it was a very nice perk we got free continental breakfasts and hordeuvres free wifi and there was a computer and printer in the lounge that came in handy for printing our tickets for our activities if you are lucky enough to be upgraded be sure to get a to go container for your breakfast and you can take it up to the altitude sky lounge and eat your breakfast outside
the room was very nice and clean the kids loved that the turn down service included rock candy and oreo cookies each day i am not sure if this is a perk of being upgraded or if they do this for everyone but the kids loved it they also had bowls of candy in the lobby the only drawback to the room was that there was no refrigerator the hallway carpets were a little on the dingy side but other than that i was completely happy with the hotel and i am a high maintenance kind of girl
the staff was super friendly everyone we met from the maid to the valet guys were super friendly and helpful outstanding service
if you get a chance to go to a padres game i highly recommend it were not padre fans but it was still fun and the tickets are so cheap that we were able to sit in the 8th row the kids got to meet some of the players and they will sign autographs the best part was that its right next to the hotel so there was not fighting traffic we also went to heavenly cupcake for my sons birthday which is just a few blocks from the hotel they were really good but a bit pricey we ate a buds one evening and recommend it if you are on foursquare you can check in and get free tater tots there isnt a kids menu but they did have chicken tenders and sliders and what kid doesnt love tater tots my husband also recommends the strip club which which is a restaurant where you pick out your own steaks and cook the steaks on a grill we did not do this on this trip but he was there a few months ago and said it was neat experience and the food was good we also found a great breakfastbrunch place called mary janes we loved it i had a great breakfast burrito and the kids enjoyed the bottomless bowl of cereal and mickey mouse shaped pancakes
we would definitely stay there again",5.0
great room great location poor service,rooms are great newly redecorated and surprisingly quite location is perfect to any venue in times square bring your wallet food prices are off the wall suggest restaurant located in edison hotel across the street  nothing fancy but breakfast and lunch prices are 70 less than marriott service at marriott very poor at check in the individiual uttered barely 3 words asked concerige for assistance to get a package  you might have thought i asked for a trip to the moon leave early for any appointment you have scheduled the wait for the elevator may be 5 to 10 mintues,3.0
great hotel for a new york visit,we stayed at the library during a conference in late february the conference hotel was elsewhere more expensive and much less fun our room was small clean thoughtfully arranged and very nice the reading room with refreshments all day a generous breakfast each morning and lovely wine hour each afternoon is a wonderful amenity books magazines and newspapers everywhere rooms numbered by the dewey decimal system each with books focused on a content theme very convenient to grand central station airport transportation and the attractions of the city a wonderful experience that we hope to repeat in future trips to nyc,5.0
the definition of luxurious,i spent a couple of days in chicago and had the pleasure of being a guest at the elysian the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the accommodations are designed to pamper the room had a magnificent view of downtown chicago was modern in a very refined way and felt very residential the spa and fitness facility was the best i have experienced all the equipment was state of the art and included pilates and gyrotonic programs the indoor lap pool was treated with saline instead of chlorine and featured a beautifully serine lounging area the mens locker room was unparalleled the staff was very attentive and genuinely interested in making you comfortable in any way possible chicago is my favorite city and this made a fabulous trip even better,5.0
decent stay but better options,"dont know what was paid for the hotel so i really cannot comment on the value basically this is a no frills hi that would be less than 100night anywhere than nyc ok but youd get a much better deal via any travel site or do better paying a little more for nicer digs 
good decent but small lobby rooms were actually large by nyc standards had interior courtyard room away from city noise which was good since we were on a low floor
other rooms were spread in other towers odd configuration average basic furnishing and linens mixed cleaning
bad small double beds when two queens could have easily fit very noisy with hallneighbors dated dirty small bathroom",3.0
ask for room in back away frm street  very clean nice staff quaint great price and location,"we stayed here for 3 nights last week had an amazingly good price combined with airfare from pricelinecom never been to baltimore before nice convenient location near many tourist sites in historic fells point staff helpful room good  clean nicely decorated with old photos and information about old times which fits into neighborhood
be sure to get a room that is not facing the street as area is very busy at night with popular restaurants and bars we did and had no problems
quibbles 
1 10 daily resort fee per room which can not get out of covers usage of business center two ok pcs in lobby which were not that hard to get onto free unlimited localnational phone calls most probably use their cells anyway  2 bottles of water  access to a primo fitness center about 15 blocks away

beware of wifi charges,bad start with crowds in the lobby and a long line waiting to check in unfriendly reception staff who were apparently not very experienced at their job and who did not make you feel welcome at all not even an apology for being kept waiting room quite newly decorated but in very ugly colours from the 70s era so not pleasant to look at and lacking a luxurious feel bar and restaurant are extortionate go outside to eat and drink worst of all were the mind blowing charges to connect to wifi for each appliance this was a real kick in the teeth after paying so much for the room in the first place and this issue left a bad taste in my mouth for sure would never use this hotel again and urge you to research elsewhere for more a generous hotel that does not aim to rip you off and somewhere that gives better service than this place,1.0
horrible experience on so many levels,i planned to stay for 3 nights but moved to a different hotel after 1 night due to terrible experience at checkin i asked to upgrade to a larger room i was told one would be available in a 12 hour we went to lunch and returned an hour later and were given our room keys we entered the room and saw it had not been cleaned we walked around the room and found personal belongings cell phone and realized the guest had not checked out we reported this to the front desk and were sent to a different room i questioned the bed size  looked like a double and we wanted at least a queen  and was told the bed was a queen but come back to the front desk and well give you a better room we went to the 3rd room and found it was identical to the 2nd the room was so small that my husband and i could not walk around we had to hop over the bed to get to the bathroom we tried to take a nap but couldnt sleep because the pipes in the bathroom were rattling each time a different guest used their water there was a problem with drainage in the shower i stood in water up to my ankles while showering while waiting in the lobby for a friend i witnessed a fight amongst the front desk staff a woman said to a man dont you dare raise your hand at me like that again you are not my boss and she stormed out of the lobby onto the street other arguments between them were witnesssed during the stay lastly we asked the front desk when breakfast coffee would be available because we were starting our day really early at approximately 5am we were told breakfast is not available that early but the front desk staff member offered to make coffee and provide breakast pastries to accomodate us the next morning the front desk was left vacant and the breakfast area was dark we entered the room in hopes that something would be available we only had 5 minutes to spare we found the front desk staff person sleeping in the breakfast area we asked for coffee and he said he could provide juice instead after all of these issues i found another hotel in the area to accomodate us we then checked out after one night this hotel was terrible and i will never stay there again,1.0
great hotel for family,we stayed at the hotel after attending a phillies vs nationals game in late august we wanted a hotel that offered free breakfast for our family  2 adults2 children as well as one that had easy access to the subway we were more than happy with our hotel choice hotel was very nice and clean and there were many restuarants win walking distance staff was friendly helpful and responsive wasted no time bringing us more towels etc upon request the breakfast according to our sons 10 and 7 was awesome they are big eaters the free buffet was pretty much anything you could possibly want for breakfastthe madetoorder omelettes were great even had egg whites as option my husband and i thought the breakfast was above average as well best of allthey allowed us to keep our car in the garage paytopark reasonable while we went to the natl zoo the next day you can catch the metro under the hotelso convenient will look to stay here again for sure,5.0
nice location and clean rooms,front office staff is helpful and the rooms are comfortable only thing that i wish i could change was the lack of ice machines as the closest one was three floors down and about 25 rooms away hotel circle is always a great place to stay as well from a location standpoint as its close to a lot of the attractions bathroom doors didnt quite close all the way but other than that the room was fine,4.0
perfect location,i arrived at the night hotel on december 28 the day after the big blizzard my friend and i had to walk to the hotel from penn station because the cab line was so long just so you knowits possible when we arrived we were very impressed with how sharp the hotel looked the people at the desk were very friendly although when we asked for a seafood hotel suggestion one of the girls recommended red lobster the room was very spacious for new york standards and it smelled great the lights were on and the radio was playing which we really liked we ate at a wonderful greek restaurant the first night kellaros jersey boys was wonderful and the hotel is steps away from times square yet its very quiet once youre in the room at one time there must have been a free continental breakfast but that didnt come with our room so we walked across the street to the cranberry cafe and got a coffee and pastry the next morning for 300 there is also a starbucks next door the next night we tried bobby vans next door we just had bread two appetizers and drinks it ws quite expensive but they were perfectly fine with us just getting appetizers and were very friendly back to the room our towel rack had fallen off the wall so we both had to use the hook on the back of the door but this wasnt really a problem the bed was very comfy and there was turndown service each night with chocolates i would definitely stay here again i think we paid around 24500 per night and i thought it was a pretty good value for the city,4.0
outstanding service lovely rooms great food,we booked into the james for two nights and extended it to four nights  because we loved it the staff were wonderful from the moment i called to book it to the moment we checked out we were treated like family i have traveled a lot all over the world and never had such a great hotel experience in my entire life the beds are so cosy the room service was so good and the views from the room were fab book it,5.0
nice business hotel,the westin was perfectly nice i had read other reviews critical of the hotel but did not find any of those issues during my stay the conference facilities were convenient and well attended by hotel staff the room was large and even had a partial view of the water,4.0
seventh time at the marquis and still love it,"we generally avoid large hotels but the ny marriott marquis is an exception recently stayed there for the seventh time and found that nothing had changedits still a very good hotel rooms are spacious although our room was a bit odd on this trip in that it was a little smaller than the norm and the door opened out into the hall rather than inmaybe it was part of a suite at one time no worries though as its very comfortable and wellappointed and the best part quiet its a huge hotel and youll rarely hear anyone else thats rare
location cant be beat we actually dont like times square but its so convenient to all of manhattan nearly every subway line runs through the 42nd st station cabs are also very easy to get and hells kitchen next to times square has some great bars and eateries
i have to laugh at people who complain about the elevatorsthey work amazingly well far better than the old days when people fought for the next available lift signage could be better for firsttimers probably
my only real complaint is the wonky wifi it simply didnt work if you werent on the side of the room where the bed was located at the desk forget it so i was forced to plug in for internet service marriott generally charges a lot of money for this but as a platinum member it was free so ill let it slide if i was paying i would have disputed this charge and simply purchased an att data package for my ipad",5.0
city centre location,"after reading many reviews from tripadvisor i decided to stay near union square in san francisco as grand hyatt was newly renovated and have received quite a number of good reviews i decided to give it a try
the taxi from airport to hotel took around 15 mins and cost usd 50  including tips hotel lobby  reception area was rather small and was crowded maybe due to the fact that one side was still under renovation there were people and luggages everywhere check in was smooth but kind of cold it was kind of mechanical without any smiles nor word of welcome
i have requested high floors as suggested by some tripadvisor members and was given a room on the 19th floor so noise disturbance from the streets was minimal
my room was newly renovated and had 2 twin beds and a flat screen tv although it is not extremely spacious i did not find it too small or cramped it can still fit 2 big suitcases if you do not keep them open at all times beds are soft and comfortable and the down pillow and quilt are also very comfortable
the bathroom has a large sink and hand held rain shower head  unfortunately my shower pressure was a bit weak there is tooth paste and hand soap but no shower cap  shower cap is important for me as i have long hair  no slippers nor bathrobes 
the room fridge is completely empty so you need to remember to get your water or drinks from nearby walgreen   there is coffee maker in room but no glass coffee pot with it i dont really bother with it as i prefer to order my coffee or have it outside however there is no room service menu and we had to ask for one from housekeeping and when we made the order we were told that quite a few things were not available as that was the old menu not a big deal just minor annoyance
in room wifi works well but can only connect only up to 3 devices
location is wonderful  there is a small convenient store walgreen   3 mins walk away  when you get out from the hotel go left then turn left again when you reach traffic lights small diner  loris is opposite walgreen which is good for a quick bite or breakfast starbucks is 2 mins away
you do not need a car in san francisco city as everything is pretty close by taxis are not that expensive but of course if you are going to napa valley or carmel  then it will be better to have your own car
if you plan to do shopping this hotel will be a great choice as there are many shops and a few large department stores all around saks  macys and barneys are 2 minutes away and nordstrom and bloomingdales are 5 mins away and you do not have to wait long for taxi in front of the hotel
if you want to buy a prepaid sim card walk straight down stockton  exit hotel turn right then turn left on market street walk about 34 mins then you will see at t  the prepaid sim card starts at us10 or 2 per day
overall i am quite happy with this hotel and i would definitely stay here again if i could get a high floor room ",4.0
fantastic view of empire state building,first trip to new york hotel well placed for sightseeing the staff were great really friendly and happy to help with advice and suggestions everything really cleanbut the location was the best  to wake up in the morning and see the sun on the empire state building without leaving your bed,5.0
great place to stay,the marcel was great yes the rooms are small but its to be expected its ny it was such a cute room with an authentic boutique feel to it i loved it the lobby is hip and stylish its close to some great restaurants etc and the staff was super friendly i would highly recommend staying here especially for the great price my room was 215,5.0
ace hotel was brilliant,"i had read bad reviews and good reviews so wasnt sure what to expect it was a great hotelthere are a few steps up to the front desk but its not that bad and when i left the guy on the desk offered to carry my suitcase the staff were really friendly and helpful happy to give directions they even helped me unpick my suitcase lock when it broke and they printed up some stuff for me i stayed in two different rooms while i was there as i had a few days at the hotel then went to university of washington then came back again both rooms were decorated differently the beds were comfy in both rooms and there were lots of tv channels which is always good when u first arrive somewhere and just need an hour or so to relax the wireless internet connection was good and fast the showers and toilets were really clean and they provide shower gel and shampoo also get your own bathrobes which was handy
if you wanted your room cleaned you had to put a thing on your doori saw people complaining about this but you dont need clean towels every day
breakfast is basic toast jam cereal apples yoghurt and then theres coffee tea orange juice and milk i think the hotel is also pet friendly as i saw someone with a dog
there is a mini supermarket across the road and you are near everything like pike place market capitol hill and downtown etc this hotel really is in a great location id heard some people complaining about noise from the cyclops club which is below it i didnt get kept awake at night at all although my second room was not on 1st avenue and so was quieter than the first one in any case i am sure you could request a room not on 1st avenue when you book
i would definitely come back here its funky clean and the staff are lovely",5.0
adequate hotel in west seattle,stayed here for four nights in november 2012 room was spartan but clean it did not have a dresser for clothing staff was very friendly and kind breakfast room was minimal but adequate ymca was only a block away and cost for a days membership was only 5 only hotel in small community of west seattle,3.0
maybe youll have better luck,"this is an ok hotel with a somewhat responsive staff i arrived first and gave them the name of my friend who would be checking in later which the front desk person seemed to type into the computer though his name wasnt in the system when he arrived
when the battery in the smoke alarm in our room went low and began making an intermittent clunking sound they changed that right away when the chain that lifts and drops the sunscreen that scrolls over the window broke they fixed that pretty quickly and the woman who came to fix it was nice when we asked for some nondown pillows and comforter which caused allergies they did remove the pillows and comforter when we were out but they didnt replace them until we called again and asked them for uhm some pillows and blankets the king size bed is actually two twin beds stuck together or actually not stuck together so you pretty much stay to your own twinbed side of the bed unless you want to sleep in a crevice
the bathroom lights are painfully bright and i suspected in fact at one point that it might also double as a tanning booth the water turns on scalding hot unless the faucet is all the way to the right you can tell this is a not an american hotel
after going out on our last night i asked the folks at the front desk about arrangements for getting to the airport the next morning  that is scheduling a pick up for the airport express bus i was dismissively told to talk to the concierge in the morning
actually as i write this im becoming much more critical and view this as a pretty bad hotel experience with small though cumulatively annoying misfires  though maybe our experience is not typical and you might do ok 
having said that i loved chicago and my time there i will definitely visit chicago again hotel sofitel not",2.0
great place to stay,"wonderful boutique hotel great food great rooms great atmoshphere friendly staff i could go on
best of all was their nightly roundthefire get together with free wine and popcorn  a chance to chat and mingle with other guests or just relax with a glass or two of wine after a busy day sightseeing
very central and easy to get about from
loved the animal skin print dressing gown and slippers some other nice little touches such as ipod chargeralrm clock in room and free wifi

shoddy overpriced dump not worth the money,"i was very dissapointed by the belvedere the first room was tiny and didnt have a mirror other than the small bathroom one i requested but was never minded when my 16year old granddaughter joined me for 5 nights we had to move twice until i finally got a decent just decent room the furniture is old shoddy the drawers fall apart the shower curtain was too short the airconditioning old and noisy
bad place will never go back and would never recommend it i stayed for 9 nights and regretted all of them",2.0
great choice,"this hotel was a great choice for a short weekend of sightseeing in dc the location was excellent a relatively short walk from everything we did  national gallery of art and 3 other smithsonian musuems the kennedy center and some theater at the josephine butler park center i use the word relatively for the distances because i did not find the walks long but i am used to walking distances of 13 miles easily also the metro was about a easy 5 mi from the hotel and i took it in from iad and leaving thru dca and no problem
room was very clean and well laid out hotel was very quiet also no street noise we were on the 8th floor street side with a nice view nothing spectualar but not an alley view
only very small annoyance was the heatingcooling unit in the room i found it a bit noisy when it ran but i am a light sleeper so others may not be bothered by it there were signs up in the hotel saying they were upgrading their heatingcooling systems but i have no idea if this was a new or an old unit
the hotel was an excellent value for what we paid and would definitely stay at this hotel again as long as the rate was reasonable",5.0
this was our first stop if our round the,"this was our first stop if our round the world tour and it was great the location was perfect so close to times square and restaurants

there are restaraunts everywhere and for the best pizza u must check out armedeus famous pizza its litteraly up the road 8th ave  5 min walk cheap too really good pizza",4.0
save your money  go to a hilton hotel,"i took my boyfriend to san diego for his first time as a birthday present since it was a present i thought i would reserve a room at the w so he could feel like it was an upscale fancy trip bad idea when i took a shower the first night the shower drain was clogged so i couldnt take longer than a 15 minute shower without the water overflowing onto the bathroom floor it is a bad feeling to know you are at the w and standing in your own dirty water the next morning i went to the front desk to ask that they send someone up to look at it it seemed like an inconvenience to ask
the carpet was in really bad condition it was pulled and we kept tripping over it on the way in and out of the room
the ice machine was broken on our floor since its the w you can only use your room key to go to your own floor and not go to another floor for ice my boyfriend went down to the lobby to get ice and notified them of the broken ice machine that they said they would look at the machine was not fixed by the next day
i travel a lot for business and pleasure ive had better service at so many other places stay away from this one",1.0
comfortable clean and good service and affordable,i was part of a group of football coaches in baltimore for a clinicmy wife picked this hotel for the price proximity to the meeting and the amenities that were included we were 8 of us very pleased the fitness room was nice and whirlpool very clean the beds are probably the most comfortable i have slept in on a trip away from home the breakfast buffet was top notch and coffeeteafresh hot cookiesfruit available as we got back in the late afternoon was a an unexpected surprise close to 2 friendly neighborhood pubs and camden yards is right across the street i will use this hotel on all future trips,4.0
wonderfulagain,my wife and i first stayed here on the san francisco leg of our honeymoon in july 2005 we were there for 3 nights now were fortunate to live in the local area and went back for a weekend in the city and stayed at the monaco againits still great we arrived early and checked our bags with the bag check station as i was handling the valet my wife was chatting with the front desk personnel explaining that we had stayed here for our honeymoon and we were not going to be together for our anniversary this year because of my work what a pleasant surprise it was to find they were gracious enough to send a bottle of champagne to our room for our almost anniversary the rooms are very comfortable and spacious enough they were very quick to have nondown pillows sent up as we asked the wine hour they have was fun and the staff was very friendly and conversational if you are a light sleeper and go to bed a little earlier than most i would advise against room 224 or 225  there is a balcony right by the doors to the rooms that overlooks the bar downstairs the noise may keep you up its not deafening and is no worse than traffic but you never know,4.0
first timers to new york,this was our first time in new york so it really is hard to compare the jolly madison towers with any other hotel we were in town for our 20 year anniversary a special time and i booked the deluxe room which was just beautiful in pictures on line and was to also have a view of the empire state building when we got into the room is was far from what the pictures viewed as deluxe and the view was of a brick building our room was changed when requested but still far from what they advertise as deluxe on the web site the room was clean but in real need of updating the concierge was very friendly and most helpful in helping us back to the airport on check out day this hotel did have perfect location and in walking distance to so much considering it is new york i would say the price is fare and would consider staying here in the future not so sure if i would recommend it to others though,3.0
best hotel in new york,just back from a stay in this wonderful hotel i have been to new york 8 times now and this was my first time to stay here have stayed in the likes of the plaza on 5th ave before and have to say that i found this hotel the best of the lot i can not recommend this place enough the friendliest staff you will ever find anywhere the hotel itself is very clean i though the room was a fine size considering what i have read the bathroom was also fine only problem was i would have liked it to have air con as when opening the window the smell from the italian next door was not to pleasant riks cafe was fantastic great breakfast and great wine when we checked out i couldnt believe it when we were told to make full use of the cafe until we had to get the flight we were also told that if we had a late flight the make sure we came back for the wine and cheese later even though we were checked out they were truly amazing cant fault anything location cleanliness friendliness food everything was great try tonys next door for the best italian food ever and apple martinis jimmys cornor around the block is an experience a dive but a fantastic dive owned by a professional boxer who serves behind the bar this place has so much atmosphere want to meet true new yorkers well here is the place to go also try st andrews 2 doors up,5.0
great club lounge,spg is great in its treatment of platinum members the club lounge at the gateway is great with nice food offerings and great service my wife and i were even allowed to bring in our own bottle of wine to have with our dinner which really it was there is certainly enough to fix a small meal on what they offer the room was spacious but the bathroom was small the halls are tired and certainly not up to the same standard as the lobby the internet speed was fine for our purpose the guest laundry on level three was appreciated however the single washer and dryer could be augmented with another couple of machines and moved to a larger area the price for the machines was 250 each,4.0
great hotel,"i was very worried about staying at this hotel after reading many of the reviews on this website 
however i was very impressed after staying here 
the check in was simple and very helpful the concierge helped us find our way to ikea and was very pleasant whenever we passed an employee in the hallway they would smile and say hello 
the location was perfect for shopping on michigan ave 
we couldnt have gotten a better price than we received on priceline much below the asking price of the hotels website 
we would stay here again anytime",4.0
nice hotel but didnt feel like a hilton,"this is a pretty nice hotel but the feel and look didnt really say hilton to me it could have just as easily been called by any other chain hotel name the staff was friendly especially the breakfast staff they really were a pleasure to deal with and were prompt about refills and requests
the rooms were nothing special beds were of ok quality and the pillows were soso i stayed there for 21 nights for business and slept pretty good i asked for a mini fridge in the room and it was there when i showed up which was nice as i already had to perishable items the room did have some maintenance issues i wouldnt expect from a hilton nothing major but missing or broken trim pieces around the bathroom accessories the air conditioner panel in my room had no screws in it so it was just being held in place by the desk there were some rythmic thumping noises quite often no not from another room but they werent too loud the water gets very hot and it does this quickly the one great thing is that the hotel rooms have dvr so you can set up tv recordings that was definetly a nice feature
the biggest complaint is the amount of road noise i was shocked at just how much noise made it through the windows i checked and they were definetly closed but being that they are able to be opened by sliding them i dont think they are sealing very well any more i was in two seperate rooms and it was the same in both rooms being the greater la area traffic is moving at any time of the day or night
the workout room was ok but not what i would expect from a hilton if you plan to do more than just run on an treadmill or eliptical theres not much for you you have 2 things a dumbell rack that goes from 550lbs in 5lb incriments and a cable crossover machine that goes up to i believe 150lbs on each side neither of which is enough weight to use for most people that plan on using a hotel gym a nice multiple station nautilus type machine would be a nice addition
although included in my company rate i still feel obligated to talk about the extras that most will have to pay for it still boggles my mind that hotels charge for internet and self parking you have a car and want to park youre paying even if you want to self park want to valet thats 19 per night want internet access thats 1195 per day for a pretty slow connection the fastest i was able to time it was about 110kbps not enough to watch netflix in very good quality
tripadvisor calls 3 dots average and that is what this experience was exactly average nothing more nothing less",3.0
great place to stay on the riverwalk,great location excellent rooms great breakfast buffet and good fitness center,5.0
beleive the hype,"the chancellor hotel comes highly recommended the staff were friendly and approachable the location cant be beaten close to train tram bus and of course the cable car

it made an excellent base for exploring sf would definitely use again if lucky enough to return to sf",5.0
very enjoyable for a business stay,"i stayed here for two nights for a business trip i drove from dfw and it was easy to find right off i30 i had some concerns about my car being broken into based on some reviews of neighboring hotels but i had no issues at all i had the king semisuite which was a oneroom suite that had the bed a couch desk fridge microwave and flat screen tv also free wifi is much appreciated there was some road noise from the interstate but it didnt keep me awake or anything so i wouldnt let that dissuade you from staying here it was very nice
some other nice things about the hotel 1 fresh baked cookies for free in the lobby along with infused ice water 2 free breakfast every morning was excellent makeyourown waffles bagels wcream cheese assorted pastries and muffins cereal fruit juice plus a rotating daily menu of hot items like omelets french toast sticks hash browns etc usually hotel breakfasts are lacking but not this one 3 i didnt get a chance to use them but this hotel had a very nice looking pool hot tub patio workout room and business center 
cons
these are all nitpicky as i didnt have any real complaints about the hotel first i had recently hurt my neck and the pillows were reaaaaaaaaally soft i normally wouldnt have even noticed but i ended up having to stack multiple pillows to get any sort of firmness for neck support
second since the shower was a walkin glass enclosure that meant there was no tub ledge to sit things on there was one tiny ledge that would hold a bar of soap but otherwise you have to put all your toiletries on the shower floor which means a lot of bending over to pick up bottles again normally not a big deal but the neck injury made it very annoying
overall this hotel was everything i was hoping it would be when i booked it and i would definitely stay there again if im ever in the area i was comfortable felt safe and felt kinda sad when i had to check out",5.0
top notch and affordable,needed a place to stay in downtown denver for a budget family vacation this place was a short walk from most of the tourist attractions at a decent price and had stellar service the staff at this hotel surpassed their counterparts at even the swankiest places ive stayed  they were professional but above all else highly personable and authentically caring i would definitely stay here again,5.0

a perfect blend of setting and service,"my husband and i just returned from 5 days at the inn at the market from the first moments of checking in when i was asked if id prefer a seattle times or a new york times in the morning until the last moments of the bellman carefully packing my rental car i enjoyed the supreme customer service of this lovely hotel our room was beautiful with a great view of the ferries crossing the sound because we were literally only steps from the pike street market i visited daily bought fresh flowers and fruit and did some great people watchingthe cafe campagne associated with the hotel served the best french bistro food we have had anywhere steelhead cafe across the street was also fine as was place pigalle and all these great restaurants were less than a 2 minute walk the little patio at the entrance to the hotel contained two lovely shops where i did all my mothers day shopping in spite of great other shopping also walking distance away

great birthday experience,just celebrated my birthday in austin at the w in late march from the moment i walked in i felt like a celebrity their customer service was second to none the icing on the cake was coming back to my room the night before my birthday to a great piece of cake and a bottle of champagne i would recommend this place if you want to feel what luxury feels like awesome place,5.0
half moon was great,my wife and i stayed  humphreys october of 2011 we went to san diego for a wedding we stayed a thursday thru monday in one of their grand marina suites the room was fantastic very clean  lots of room we were on the 2nd floor great view of the marina the hotel is minutes from the airport shelter island is very nice if you like mexican food go to miguels mexican restraurant walking distance from the hotel the hotel also has stage shows for our stay george lopez was the entertainment for two nights if you dont want to spring for the tickets you can clearly hear the shows from the pool area just grab a seat and enjoy we spent one night in the lounge and danced all night with a band that was playing dance music from the 70s  80s both my wife and i give humphreys two thumbs up,5.0
great place to stay,the hotel was in a great location close to 5th ave and central park and there was a subway right out the door a friend and i stayed for the weekend and had a great time the room was ready when we arrived and got to go right up the elevators were a little small but it was no big deal the room was good for the two of us perfect size it was clean and the ac worked well the only thing that didnt work was the phone but we didnt use it anyway we did forget to pack conditioner but the hotel offered complementary shampoo conditioner body wash and lotion they had one of the great magnifying mirrors too there was a flat screen tv in the room with a minibar and a safe the only thing the room didnt offer which i would have preferred is a little refrigerator but the hotel was very nice and everyone was very friendly the bed was super comfy and at night we could not hear the traffic honking horns and sirens i would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend and stay there again,4.0
older hotel but exceptional service and friendly staff,we booked a last minute stay after an awful experience at our usual stay hampton inn at southpark in charlotte we stayed on the executive level and enjoyed the lounge that offered drinks snacks breakfast etc although the room was a bit dated stains on carpet chipping paint on bathroom door standard hotel furniture the experience more than made up for it and the cost was fair there are lots of little shops nearby and concord mills within 20 minutes one thing to note is you have to request the mini fridge upon reservationarrival if your room type is not a larger suite we were unable to obtain one hope this review is helpful happy travels,4.0
good start to the year 2011,we stayed in the hilton for a week over the new year period despite it being a busy period the staff were good and the house keeping excellent lots of visible security made it a reassuring stay and none of the wild partying occurred to our knowledge of the type mentioned in other reviews its a good hotel in a great location,4.0
the location is the only good thing about this hotel,"we spent 6 nights in a triple room at 80 per person per night
the location is great if you have not been to nyc before and want to be central
however
when we checked in we asked which floor the gym was on as advertised on the website and was told the 3rd floor and was told it is open 24 hours a day
due to my jet lag i went looking for the gym at 430am i was surprised when i found the gym with dismantled equipment walls with large sections of plaster missing and the strip lights in the middle of the floor needless to say i did not get much exercising done
we made it to our room after a relatively long wait for lifts they are on a strange automated system and we were very disappointed with the room on the 12th floor the carpet was stained old and tatty aong with missing bathroom tiles and a continuous running tap we were not overally impressed the heater did not work instead blowing out cold air and the safe did not close we got the safe fixed and they did comoe up straight away however we did not want to wait in all day for the engineer for the heating so went without during our stay at check in it was made very obvious to us that this was the only room available with triple status
the website also offered a good restaurant we did not see any signs when we checked in but when we checked with a very unhelpful receptionist we were told in a very rude way that renovations were going on and of course the restaurant was closed
7am each morning was the time the builders started banging there was no let up even on saturday so we got used to getting up very early which meant that we did not stay out late into the evening
i cannot decide whether the staff did not care or were so embarressed by the situation that they tried to block it out toilets in the lobby were kept locked and the key kept at concierge not an issue if the concierge were working 24 hours a day but guess what 
we also asked about a local attraction taking place in october an annual event for some years but they had no information
i understand that refurbishment is necessary however i am a strong believer that you need to be honest with your guests no restaurant or gym were big issues for me along with tatty rooms noise at 7am and staff who were demotivated and unwilling to help my advice is to stay at the intercontinental across the road or another reputable hotel and avoid the milford plaza
also as 3 guests in a room i would love to know how we were meant to share 1 bath towel
if you do have to stay here dont pay for internet at 15 a day walk for 30 seconds and use starbucks  where the staff were really friendly and they are open from 530am",1.0
luxury with a chill vibe,"the surrey is a beautiful tranquil hotel with great service and a nice cool vibe my girlfriend and i spent our anniversary there and had a great time i have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and this ranks up in my top ten the interior decor is beautiful contemporary and sleek the rooms are quiet and comfortable with great ammenities service with a smile and without pretense is among the guests who happened to be a very european while we were there interesingly enough none of my new york friends have ever heard of the surrey which made it even more special as it seemed like i discoverd it the only negative was there was a smoking fee of 200 dollars added to my bill at the end of the stay my girlfriend smoked one cigarette while there we were never told about the no smoking policy or the fee which aggravated me until my girl talked some sence to the manager who finally omitted the fee 
great place just keep your stash out of the room",4.0
great hotel right near i95,"booked this hotel being familiar with the butler blvdi95 area turned out to be a great location and a nice comfortable hotel lobby is not the newest fairfield design but updated and modern with an invitiing feel checkin was efficient and friendly was pleasantly surprised with the upscale design of the room especially the bathroom with nice tile floor and an upscale vanity area bed was very comfortaable with two differnet types of pillows i preferred the fluffier ones lighting was another plus with several fixtures throughout the room on three way switches never did get to breakfast but it looked to be just as nice as the rest of the hotel 
location is great with easy access to i95 and butler two minutes away are a cracker barrel and applebees with many more options a few miles away at town center",5.0
perfect place for an individual to stay,i chose the chelsea lodge mostly for the price because i was only going to be in nyc one night and just wanted a safe and comfortable place to sleep i was given a room on the third floor which faced the back of the hotel the hotel will not guarantee you a specific room but i think it is important to note that my room faced the back because i heard no noise from the street when i went to sleep at night or in the morning this may not be the case if your room faces the front the hotel gave me a key to my room and to the front door of the brownstone so i could come and go as i pleased it felt like coming home at the end of the night the room had a double bed which was very comfortable for one i dont know if you book a double if the bed is any bigger it would have been tight to share that bed with my husband the room had an open closet for hanging clothes a dresser a tv which i never watched a small desk a double bed a small chair a sink and a shower the shower had good water pressure and lots of hot water the room did not get wet when i used the shower as has happened in some hotels i have stayed in the one thing i felt was missing from the room was a full length mirror could be put on the back of the door it would have been nice to help with getting ready to go out the location of the hotel is ideal quick walk to the village and midtown great access to subways and you can always hop in a cab the neighborhood has lots of great restaurants and bars and there were lots of people out and about late at night the hotel is on a treelined side street though so it is quieter i would definitely recommend this hotel but the rooms are small so if two friends are travelling together it woud be best to each get their own room,4.0
great value and excellent location for family travel,this is a very good clean spacious option at a fantastic price in an amazing location for lower manhattan i urge you not to pay attention to the reviews that say its dirty its not or hot and noisy the ac was fine in the hottest month ever my wife and i enjoyed the double bed our son had the couch and we rented a rollaway for our daughter we did not cook but the kitchen was fine the suite is spacious and comfortable for four people and its new york so youre not there much the hotel is close to a subway and easy walking to soho shopping and attractions the lower east side and up broadway tons of great restaurants the tenement museum nearby whats not to like here,4.0
first trip to new york,my wife and i stayed at the affinia manhattan on december 1923 2011 we arrived at the hotel before 1000am and was able to check in at this time when we arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was that the room was small the queen sized bed took up much of the room the bathroom was even smaller the bathroom door could not open all the way because the toilet was in the way since this was our first trip to nyc we were not in our room much generally we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner the hotel is a very nice hotel the concierge was great meg was the person we dealt with and she is very knowledgeable about everything nyc the doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi the room service people were never seen yet every time we came back to our room everything was cleaned and straightened up they say whomever they are the best way to tell if the hotel was good is if the people who stayed at the hotel would so again i would not hesitate to stay there again it was a great experience,5.0
great hotel,this is a quietly elegant hotel in a very convenient quiet location service is typically great specially the valet and doormen the rooms are spacious and very well appointed and a big plus for us is that they accept pets the restaurant is good specially breakfast and there is excellent complimentary coffee in the lobby early in the morning i only wish they left it out a while longer since it is typically gone by the time i get there at around 10 am oh and the rates are way higher since about six months ago i hope they bring them back down so that we will continue to stay here,5.0
ok but price seemed a bit steep,the dylan provided a comfortable room and a good sleep and i was grateful to it for being able to provide a booking at short notice in the early hours of the morning due to a mixup at another nearby hotel everything worked including good air conditioning and a serviceable bathroom with excellent piping hot water in the basin its let down by a slightly rundown feel to some of the public areas of the hotel given that 440 a night seemed a bit much but ok overall and as others have noted the position is brilliant including for the good new york deli next door that does fantastic sandwiches,3.0
nice hampton,good location downtown right beside the nascar hall of fame easy safe walk to the time warner arena as well took the family for a fun weekend of shopping and ahl hockey breakfast is included with the room as is standard with hamptons which is nice to have with kids room was clean comfortable and quiet there is a parking garage attached to the hotel where you can valet or self park but there is a charge even to self park overall it was a nice hotel and i would stay there again,4.0
top notch,the view from my room looks out over the bay and i see all the key sights very comfy beds with great linens and pillows also very clean its fantastic if you have to work a bit because the desk looks out over the amazing view hotel staff is very helpful and nice only problem is the key card to the room is super sensitive and i have to try it several times to get it to open great location for china town and i do love chinese food i totally recommend staying here,5.0
nice pleasant atmosphere,"coming from the caribbean missing our flight to munich and without warm clothes luggage was not loaded in stt we had to stay near the phl airport until the next afternoon following the recommendation on tripadvisor we choose the fairfield inn and got the last available room
the shuttledriver offered us to drive us directly to a shop to buy some items for the night 
large very comfortable beds and a nice breakfast
also we were offered a late checkout without any additional payment
overall a very recommendable hotel",4.0
pretty but noisy,for the week i spent in arizona i stayed at four hotels 3 independents and this one i found this one to be the most expensive and most dissappointing of them all the room looked very nice the bed was comfortable but the walls were apparently made from paper and i could hear everything from conversations to televisions coming from the rooms on either side of me if the noice i heard was airplanes i would not complain since it is an airport hotel but i expect some privacy between rooms,2.0
a great place to stay,"this was the third time that we stayed at the hotel the hotel is located in a convenient area relatively a short walking distance to china town and little italy on a nice day it is a nice walk to the village there is a subway station around the corner if you drive in from the south it is right near the holland tunnel so you dont have to drive through the city we like the fact that it is not in the nosiest busiest part of town
the staff is fabulous welcoming friendly helpful always with a smile on the their faces 
the rooms are cozy clean with comfortable beds the room size is typical for many nyc rooms in the past we paid much more for smaller rooms the price for nyc is very reasonable
two things to consider the breakfast is not worth the money you can get a cheaper and better breakfast nearby if you are driving in dont pay the hotel to park the car there is a cheaper deal around the corner on spring street",5.0
loved the bed,i have never experienced such a comfortable bed in a hotel before kudos to the kitano for picking such a wonderful bed we arrived very early 11am but were allowed to check in which is always appreciated but never expected the room was very clean and extremely quiet due to the soundproof windows we had a room right above the jazz lounge and were warned that we would hear the music but it wasnt bad at all ive come to expect a fee for the internet but was disappointed that we could only use one device in this day and age people travel with smartphones computers ipads so it would have been nice to be able to connect with whichever one we wanted without having to pay a separate fee for each i was also surprised that there was no ironironing board in the room other than that the room was very nice bathroom was spacious and welllit climate control was good my husband used the free pass for the new york sports club to work out and loved it overall a very enjoyable stay,4.0

a great place to unwind after san diego freeways,"we stayed at the sofia on a quick overnight trip to visit the zoo i dont like downtown areas generally but once you enter this calm and lovely boutique hotel youll feel like you could be just about anywhere the staff was exceptionally warm and welcoming offering us a very reasonable upgrade to a larger suite which we opted for the rooms are on the small side but classic clean and cozy especially for a short stay make sure to take a selfguided historical tour with the help of the hallways and their dreamy fact  imagefilled lithophane light sconces 
not wanting to revisit the bustling streets at dinner time we decided to try our luck at the hotels restaurant currant delicious perfect choice for two hungry foodies the predinner sangria was exceptional our waiter was exceptional too it was an easy drive from there to the zoo",5.0
felt right at home here,ive stayed at many downtown chicago hotels this is my new favorite location is handy the service at checkin and during my stay was flawless the room was large and immaculate including the bathroom i really enjoy a good breakfast while traveling and was not disappointed here all the servers were topnotch my full breakfast arrived in 4 minutes one morning great coffee from an admitted coffee snob really pleasant effortless stay,5.0
perfect bargain city hotel,i made my reservation online at the bijou because it said that the last person whod reserved lived in france turned out to be an excellent choice and it is mostly europeans who seem to stay there they know bargains comfort and chic obviously the hotel is very well kept up and the staff is friendly plus you get a free breakfast buffet thrown in with your 60 a night double they also show old movies in a charming little theater though you wont have time to watch themthe hotel is conveniently located near everything in downtown san franciscotwo blocks to market street three to powell for a cable car about the same for union square not to mention many restaurants and all kinds of transportation amazing at these prices for a major american city,5.0
wonderful hotel for my journey to the pitchfork festival,"i stayed at the palmer house hilton to attend the pitchfork music festival i stayed july 1619 2009 i booked through pricelinecom very cheap and was pleased with the hotel
comments
 i thought the location of the palmer house in the loop was perfect the hotel takes up an entire block and there are three entrances each of which is right next to a subway or el stop the blue red and all the loop trains it was so easy to get around the hotel is one block from millennium park where the bean is and also about one block from the art institute of chicago 
 the hotel is huge it was packed with guests the entire trip 
 the room was clean stylish and comfortable the queensze bed was firm with nice bedding the bathroom was immaculate and had a wonderful bath tub the only strange thing was that the tv was on the dresser in the corner of the room but i only watched for about 30 minutes the entire trip
 there is no free internet wireless which was kind of disappointing you could pay for one hour in the lobby about 7 or 15 per 24 hours in your room but there is a 24hour business center where you can print our your boarding pass for free
 there is a starbucks on the ground level no coffee machines in the rooms",4.0
